<p>Flutter vs React Native, two widely used cross platform tools, but what should I use?. In this “experiment”, Im going to try to develop the same app, in both frameworks, the goal is to spot differences between them.</p>
<p>No framework is better than the other, they work in different ways, and they fit different developer requirements</p>
<h2>Main differences</h2>
<p>For me the main difference between them, is that React Native run using a Javascript bridge, while Flutter is compiled to native code. This is strictly reflected in the performance of each one.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Flutter</td><td>React Native</td></tr><tr><td>Language</td><td>Dart</td><td>Javascript</td></tr><tr><td>Compiles native code</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Maintained by</td><td>Google</td><td>Facebook</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2>What im going to build and test</h2>
<p>I will write an app in both frameworks, will be a simple app using the <a aria-label="Rick and Morty API (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick and Morty API</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to test:</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<ul><li>How fast is to install each framework create and run an app</li><li>Reloading time, both frameworks have hot reloading, a fast one is needed for a seamlessly development workflow</li><li>Development experience, which one offers a better development experience</li></ul>
<p>Part 2</p>
<ul><li>Writing the app in React Native</li><li>Writing the app in Flutter</li></ul>
<p>Part 3</p>
<ul><li>Testability, how easy is to test each app</li><li>Stress test and benchmarking </li></ul>
<h2>Installing Flutter and React Native</h2>
<p>Before I start, i have already installed in my computer Android Studio and Xcode, since they are not related directly to any framework, I won’t include their installation process.</p>
<h3>Flutter process</h3>
<ol><li>Install the <a aria-label="Flutter SDK (opens in a new tab)" href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flutter SDK</a> (2min)</li><li>Add the Flutter SDK PATH (20s)</li><li>Create the app with flutter create (1min)</li></ol>
<p>The whole process to install Flutter took me 3 minutes, not including the downloading time, also Flutter provides a tool called flutter doctor, which for first installs is really useful it scans our system to check if we have all the needed tools for flutter development (Xcode, Android Studio, Dart plugins, VScode extensions…)</p>
<h3>React Native process</h3>
<p>You can use Expo, but I will use React Native CLI</p>
<ol><li>Install Node.js (3min)</li><li>Install watchman (2min</li><li>Create our app with typescript support (2min)</li></ol>
<p>Total time, 7 mins, and i needed to fix my nvm versions, also first build took about 3 minutes to start.</p>
<p>The Flutter installation process was smoother and faster than the React Native one, probably because RN needs to deal with Node.js under the hood…</p>
<h2>Development experience</h2>
<h3>Hot reloading</h3>
<p>Hot reloading is a must feature for me in web and app development, both, React Native and Flutter have the same feature.</p>
<p>I tested both with the default app which each framework creates</p>
<p>Flutter took 47ms to hot reload the app</p>
<p>React Native took 630ms, because it needs to compile javascript and inject it again with Metro.</p>
<p>Also a note on this, Flutter hot reloading only worked for me if I run my app from VScode, if i run the flutter app from an external terminal, the <strong>automatic hot reloading</strong> doesn’t work, I need to type r to hot reload the app, while in React Native you only need to save the file. I guess this is the only tradeoff. </p>
<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>I installed Flutter extension for VScode, which is very recommended from the dev team. It adds an extension icon in your sidebar, and you can view your project structure from that tab.</p>
<p>For React Native I added React Native Tools, you can run React Native commands directly from your VScode command palette, but if you run your app from a terminal i don’t find it very useful</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>Both frameworks come with their own debugging tools, however, for me Flutter ones are more useful.</p>
<p>One thing I don’t like about React Native debugger is that you can’t see directly your network requests, you need to do some tweaks in order to do that, you can see more info about that <a aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="http://One thing I don't like about React Native debugger is that you can't see directly your network requests, you need to do some tweaks in order to do that, you can see more info about that here" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></p>
<p>Here you can see each one debugger GUI</p>
<p>React Native:</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Part 1</h2>
<p>In terms of development experience, Flutter is the winner for me, the whole process from 0 to app running in my emulator didn’t took more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>With React Native, compilation took a lot of time (I’m running each one in a 16″ 2019 Macbook Pro), also i had some Node.js issues.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL schema is a set of rules describing the functionality available to the client, including specification of operations (queries and mutations) that can be executed to execute against your data graph. When building a GraphQL service, there is a choice that needs to be made whether you want to follow the code-first or schema-first path: </p>
<ul>
<li>Schema-first - which prioritizes process of designing the schema which puts schema as your source of truth and forces your code to follow the definitions stored in your schema,</li>
<li>Code-first (resolver-first) - is an approach where the GraphQL schema is implemented programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, we will end up with a fully functional GraphQL service, but this choice will influence your project in terms of the amount of work you will need to put to introduce some features (but it’s a topic that deserves to be covered in a separate post).</p>
<h2>Code-first framework for GraphQL Server development</h2>
<p>The rapid growth of GraphQL’s popularity generated the natural need for different tools, both schema-first and code-first oriented, facilitating GraphQL working experience. One of the tools representing the code-first approach is <a href="https://nexus.js.org/">GraphQL Nexus framerwork</a>.</p>
<p>GraphQL Nexus is a GraphQL framework for building your GraphQL Server, where the schema is defined and implemented programmatically. GraphQL Nexus relies on a Node.js and TypeScript thanks to which it can provide features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type-Safety</strong> -  type-definitions are being generated as you proceed with the development process &amp; inferred in your code, providing you with auto-completion and error catching,</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility with GraphQL Ecosystem</strong> - GraphQL Nexus relies heavily on graphql-js and works well with its existing types when constructing the schema which makes the auto-generated schema compatible with most popular tools like Apollo Server etc.,</li>
<li><strong>Data-Agnostic</strong> - GraphQL Nexus is a declarative syntax layered on the top of the graphql-js library which basically means that you can achieve with it all that you can do with graphql-js or apollo-tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having figured out all the types you need for your schema all you need to do is simply use <code>makeSchema</code> function to create the schema instance that would be used as the foundation for your GraphQL server.</p>
<div data-language="tsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  
  types<span>:</span> <span>[</span>User<span>,</span> Query<span>,</span> Mutation<span>]</span><span>,</span>

  
  outputs<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    typegen<span>:</span> __dirname <span>+</span> <span>'/generated/typings.ts'</span><span>,</span>
    schema<span>:</span> __dirname <span>+</span> <span>'/generated/schema.graphql'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  
  nonNullDefaults<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    input<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    output<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned GraphQL Nexus relies heavily on <code>graphql-js</code> and it’s also required for the installation:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install nexus
npm install graphql # required as a peer dependency</code></pre></div>
<p>The best way to begin with GraphQL Nexus is of course the <a href="https://nexus.js.org/docs/getting-started">official documentation</a>. After familiarizing with it the next step could be playing around with their <a href="https://github.com/prisma/nexus/tree/develop/examples">official examples</a> and the <a href="https://nexus.js.org/playground">online Playground</a>. Have fun!</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

			<p>This 
			DIY project offers the
            simple stand-alone VGA game console which is based on <b> PIC24EP512GP202</b>  microcontroller.
            As the video signal and the corresponding sync signals are generated by software, 
			the console contains a
            minimum of hardware. There is also an audio signal output with five binary tone channels, mixed by 
			a 
			passive resistor network. Two of those channels are used for sound effects,  
			similar to ones used in video games of that time (early eighties) and 
			three for background music. This output is capable of driving line 
			output for PC speakers or headphones.</p>
			<p>
			It should be noted that there is no video processing unit, PGA or 
			any special purpose chips, and that PIC microcontrollers are not 
			designed for video signal generation. Everything is achieved by a 
			series of different design tricks and some compromises.</p>
			<p>
			This is an open hardware and open software project. Video 
			and audio generators, which are the vital parts of the firmware, are 
			the parts of the operating system, which will soon be documented, and can be used 
			for any other game or application. As the timings are critical, those parts 
			are written in assembly language, but all the other parts of the 
			program (scenario for some other games or any other application) may 
			also be written in some other programming language, preferably 
			Microchip's C. In this case all parts are written in Assembler, but 
			only as a result of author's preference.</p>
			<p>
			At the moment, only the game Jumping Jack is written for the 
			platform, well known to those who played with the Spectrum personal 
			computer back in the day. However, once a new game is created, it is 
			easy to download it from the computer, via 
			the serial port. The console has a USB connector, but it is used 
			only for 5V power supply. Unfortunately, microcontrollers which are 
			packed in DIP packages (with thru-hole soldering, convenient for DIY 
			projects and workshops) do not have USB interface but only serial ports, so 
			you have to use RS 232 to download the new game instead of Jumping 
			Jack, which is deafult in this project.</p>
			<p>
			If you want to build this console, you need the PCB and components 
			which are listed <span><strong>
			<a href="http://www.voja.rs/PROJECTS/GAME_HTM/2.%20Hardware.htm#BOM">here</a></strong></span>. 
			To program the microcontroller, you should need a PIC programmer (e.g. 
			<strong>PICKIT3</strong>, avaliable <span><strong>
			<a href="http://www.microchipdirect.com/ProductSearch.aspx?Keywords=PG164130">here</a></strong></span>) and
			<strong>MPLAB X IDE</strong> software, available <span><strong>
			<a href="http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/">here</a></strong></span>. 
			But if you want to know how PIC generates video and audio signals by 
			software in real time, or even if you feel ambitious enough to 
			create your own game for this platform, please visit the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This is the first of the “interludes” which end each section of the book. They don't teach any specific skills but instead give a little flavour and background about the world of the shell, Linux and modern computing.</p><p>In this first interlude we'll look at just why the shell is experiencing something of a renaissance in the modern age of IT.</p><p>To be honest, it is hard to know whether there is an increase in popularity of the use of the shell and command-line tooling in general. There are data sources which indicate there is more widespread usage amongst the technical community - Stack Overflow tag popularity is one. LinkedIn data on desired skillsets is another. However, disassociating whether there is a general increase in the need for diverse technical skillsets and whether there is a <em>specific</em> increase in the popularity of keyboard and script operated systems is a challenge.</p><p>For the purposes of this chapter, we'll instead examine changes in the technology landscape over the last few decades and consider what those changes might mean for the shell, the command-line and similar tools.</p><p>We'll look at three specific developments in technology:</p><ul><li>Diversity of programming languages</li><li>Convergence of operating platforms</li><li>DevOps</li></ul><p>Each of these developments has a potentially profound impact on how we work with computers, and might hint at the long term need for shell skills.</p><p>So let's look at some of the key changes in the technology landscape over recent years and consider how they might affect the popularity and importance of the shell.</p><h2 id="the-diversity-of-programming-languages">The Diversity of Programming Languages</h2><p>There have been many programming languages and platforms over the years. But in recent years it is possible that the diversity has increased at a greater rate than ever before.</p><p>With the advent of the internet and the increase in the size of the online technical community, programming has in a sense become more democratised (which we will discuss a little more in the ‘citizen coder’ section). When in the past it was necessary to find physical books or teachers and tutors to learn a programming language, students can now find a wealth of resources online.</p><p>It is perhaps this democratisation which has led to a startlingly diverse world of programming languages. For many years, there were a small number of ‘general purpose’ languages, and a larger number of highly specialised languages (and associated platforms).</p><p>“C”, and later, “C++” were the go-to languages for systems programming (sometimes backed up by assembly language). This was the language which kernels and compilers were written in.</p><p>“Java” become the ‘general purpose’ language of choice for applications which had to run on many systems. “Basic” and later “C#” were the standards for Windows platform development. PHP was a staple for web development.</p><p>Alongside these giants were the workhorses for specific use cases. Erlang was (and is) a language which is highly popular in the telecommunications industry, where high availability and reliability were paramount. COBOL was the language for the financial industry, where mission critical systems ran on mainframes (and many still do).</p><p>Of course there were many other languages, but many of these other languages were highly specific, in a sense C, Java, PHP and later C# dominated the landscape.</p><p>Transition to the time of writing. In the Stack Overflow 2020 Technology Survey[^1], the top ten languages most wanted by employers are:</p><ul><li>Python</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Go</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>Rust</li><li>Kotlin</li><li>Java</li><li>C++</li><li>SQL</li><li>C#</li></ul><p>Some of our old friends are there, but there are many new languages, languages which are evolving quickly. Later on in the list we will see Swift, Dart, Ruby, Haskell, Scala. There are many programming languages which are extremely popular today.</p><p>Why does this matter for the shell? The answer is that for <em>many</em> new languages, developer tooling is not as mature (some might say bloated) as it is for the ‘Workhorse’ languages. Java developers are likely very familiar with the Eclipse IDE, Microsoft shops will be familiar with Visual Studio. These are products which have been evolving for years (or decades) to support developers with rich integrated development environments.</p><p>For server-side JavaScript, Golang, Rust, Python and other languages, the development environment really is the shell. Modern editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom and so on provide a vast amount of support and tooling, encompassing the features of a full fledged IDE if the user wants. But for modern programming languages, users often have <em>had</em> to rely on the shell to compile, transpile, manage packages, bundle and so on. The average developer today is perhaps much more likely to have to use the shell - to manage Python virtual environments one day, to run Node.js another, to install packages for Golang another.</p><p>In time tooling will likely catch up and provide a ‘friendly’ interface on top of these operations, but many engineers have realised (or always known) that direct access to simple command line tools can be <em>extremely efficient</em> when working, and that overly featured IDEs can get in the way and hide complexity.</p><p>The modern programming is often polyglot - having to be at least familiar in a number of languages. The shell provides a common environment and interface for tooling, which is accessible by all, without installing many complex components, for both development and runtime environments.</p><h2 id="convergence-of-operating-platforms">Convergence of Operating Platforms</h2><p>Whilst the variety in programming languages and developer tooling may have increased, in many ways the <em>operating platforms</em> engineers use have become more homogeneous.</p><p>In the early days of computing, each operating environment was highly diverse. There were many systems which were used for production and many of them were highly proprietary. Even popular application servers were often closed source and highly specialised.</p><p>The modern execution environment however is often fairly uniform. A Linux-like system, with few customisations, which the developer or operator can tweak to suit their needs.</p><p>More and more enterprise users have moved away from proprietary Unix platforms to Linux platforms (whether commercial or non-commercial). The earliest cloud environments were using open-source Linux distributions as the available operating systems.</p><p>Even Windows has increasing support for Linux-like operation, in the form of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest movement in this area has been the rapid adoption of Docker as a common container technology. Containers, or container-like systems have been around for a long time, but Docker brought containers to the masses. With Docker, engineers expect operating environments to be even more uniform and Linux-like.</p><p>This has made knowledge of the shell extremely valuable. For any containerised workloads, Linux and shell skills are crucial. Kubernetes (as an execution environment) has standardised things even more.</p><p>Whilst there are still many workloads which run on proprietary systems, modern solutions are often built to run in containers on Linux. The shell has historically been the most common way to manage Linux systems, and the standardisation of operating environments around Linux, or Linux-like systems has made shell skills even more critical.</p><h2 id="devops">DevOps</h2><p>Love it or hate it, DevOps has exploded in popularity. DevOps engineers, site-reliability engineers, these kinds of roles may have been unheard of in companies not that long ago and are now becoming ubiquitous.</p><p>In attempting to unify the goals of development and operation of software, DevOps represents an organisational and cultural change. Rather than having one group focus on feature development and another group focus on reliable software operations, a single group is responsible for both. The theory is that this encourages software engineers to also consider security, reliability, maintainability etc, and operators to also consider speed of delivery.</p><p>Regardless of whether teams are genuinely combined, or specialised roles are added to teams, or even if teams are still separated, the lines between development and operations blur somewhat. Software developers are expected to build and plan with knowledge of the execution environment, operators are expected to work with developers to build features which support reliability.</p><p>The intersection of these two roles often is in the realm of automation. Automated deployments after testing, automated failover in case of errors, automated alerting when potential issues are discovered, automated provisioning of environments, automated scaling of systems when load increases.</p><p>The world of automation is intimately linked to the world of the shell and in particular shell scripting. Many tasks which require automation can be easily achieved using shell scripts. Many aspects of modern environments (such as cloud environments) support provisioning and management of services via scripting. In fact, services which <em>cannot</em> be managed via shell scripts or simple interfaces are increasingly becoming obsolete. If it cannot be scripted, it cannot be automated, and the increasingly complex systems we build <em>require</em> automation.</p><p>In practice, this means software engineers are far more likely to have to build shell scripts (or at least understand how to interface with systems via the shell) than they perhaps might have been. Similarly, operators are far more likely to have to <em>program</em> automated routines to manage high availability and so on. Again, the shell and shell scripts are a common way to manage this (even if they are simply entrypoints to more complex systems, such as scripts which execute programs).</p><p>The rise in popularity of DevOps as a set of practices and beliefs has perhaps made the shell more popular, and more important, than any other recent developments in software engineering.</p><p>And for these reasons and many more, learning how to use the shell effectively has never been more relevant or practical.</p></article></div>]]>

                    <p><em>A few days ago, a cargo vessel MV Wakashio ran aground off Pointe d’Esny, on the south-east coast of Mauritius and started spilling oil.</em></p><p><em>Needless to say, we need to talk about it.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Imagine thousands of gallons of oil pouring into a water body somewhere along the coast of a small island nation. Your first order of business is to contain and clean up the spill — in that order specifically.</p><p>Because when oil does spill, it forms a thick film that floats on top of the water body slowly spreading out and thinning as time progresses. More time means more coverage area. More coverage means a more elaborate cleanup effort. So in theory, if a cleanup crew can reach a spill quickly, they could contain it more efficiently and reduce costs across the board.</p><p>With the MV Wakashio oil spill, things didn’t exactly go as planned. The ship <a href="https://gcaptain.com/wakashio-breached-oil-leaks-from-grounded-bulk-carrier-in-mauritius-police-investigation-launched/#:~:text=The%20Indian%20Ocean%20island%20nation,Brazil%20via%20Singapore%20on%20ballast.">struck</a> a reef on July 25th and its body began to crack after days of pounding waves. At the time, the Mauritius government could have averted the crisis altogether by emptying the ship of its fuel. But that did not happen. Instead, the ship kept taking the beating and finally started leaking fuel on August 6th. Now the ship’s owners contest that oil prevention measures were in place by then. But clearly, it wasn’t helping a lot.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://d3jlwjv6gmyigl.cloudfront.net/images/2020/08/5f2bf41a78a54_wakashio_ecosud-1443924.jpg"><figcaption><a href="https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/reunion/naufrage-du-wakashio-il-y-breche-fuite-huile-859552.html">Source: France Info</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The Mauritius government could have taken some initiative here. But they waited for a whole day before finally taking stock of the situation and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53702877#:~:text=The%20island%20nation%20of%20Mauritius,and%20its%20crew%20was%20evacuated.&amp;text=The%20French%20island%20of%20Reunion%20lies%20near%20Mauritius%20in%20the%20Indian%20Ocean.">declaring emergency</a> late on Aug 7th. Thankfully the people of Mauritius stepped up. As an article in the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/world/africa/mauritius-oil-spill.html">notes</a> —</p><blockquote><em>“Immediately after the accident, individuals, civil society organizations and environmental groups mobilized to save the mangrove forest and coral reefs that give Mauritian waters their rich biodiversity.<p>Thousands of volunteers pulled all-nighters gathering plastic bottles and skimming oil into barrels, while salons donated hair and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDt2gpzg133/?igshid=1uidpqls8erlm" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">children collected straw</a> from fields to help soak up the oil. Mauritians abroad began <a href="https://www.instagram.com/savemauritiusreef/" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">social media campaigns</a> to raise awareness, and hundreds of thousands of dollars <a href="https://www.crowdfund.mu/mauritius-oil-spill-cleaning-2020-mv-wakashio-306.html" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener">were collected</a> on fund-raising platforms.”</p></em></blockquote><p>However, despite the collective effort, the size of the oil slick had already <a href="https://twitter.com/UrsaSpace/status/1293587048344047621?s=20" rel="noopener">expanded 10x</a> within just one week and the cleanup effort could now take months costing the shipping company and the Mauritius government millions of dollars.</p><p>How many millions? That’s difficult to calculate.</p><p>The Exxon Valdez case— a spill of approximately 10.8 million gallons in Alaska in 1989 cost <a href="https://media.rff.org/archive/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-BCK-Cohen-DHCosts_update.pdf">$2.1 Billion</a> (in cleanup efforts). The MV Wakashio, on the other hand, was only carrying ~127,000 gallons of oil. The reason for the disparity — Exxon Valdez was a cargo ship ferrying oil. Wakashio was an empty ship travelling to pick cargo. The leak was from the fuel tank and the oil it was carrying to propel the vessel. Also, the cleanup team emptied the ship of its fuel before everything could spill out. So it’s safe to say the cleanup effort won’t cost billions.</p><p>But the impact will probably be severe either way.</p><p>Beyond the cleanup costs, we also have to contend with the ecological devastation that almost inevitably follows. Four years after the Exxon Valdez spill, a population of forage fish called herring <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/exxon-valdez-oil-spill">disappeared</a> entirely from the location where the vessel broke. Scientists still aren’t sure why this happened. They can’t even ascertain fully if the oil spill was to blame. But the impact of this disappearance was catastrophic. It spelt the death of an 8-million-dollar-a-year fishery industry. Although most fishermen never explicitly sought herrings, these small forage fishes are preyed on by larger fish for food. Once the population of herrings collapsed, it left a gaping hole in the middle of the marine food chain. 25 years later, herrings are yet to return and the fishery industry has all but vanished.</p><p>With the Wakashio oil spill, we have the same concerns. Blue Bay — The place where the ship ran aground was <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/opinion/why-mauritius-oil-spill-is-a-very-big-problem-for-the-oil-industry">declared</a> a marine park back in 1997. It’s perhaps one of the last remaining areas which still harbours undamaged coral reefs and an abundance of underwater life. The oil spill might have spelt the death of the ecological balance in the area. What will it cost the local population? We don’t know yet. But it’s a tragedy that we still have to contend with oil spills this day and age.</p><p>Share this Finshots on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=What%20happens%20when%20there%27s%20an%20oil%20spill?%20https://bit.ly/3llY8AL">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/3jdaCsa&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=What%20happens%20when%20there%27s%20an%20oil%20spill?">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/the-economic-cost-of-oil-spills">LinkedIn</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="an-inside-scoop">An Inside Scoop</h3><p>A few days back we wrote about the legal battle brewing between Apple and Epic Games.

            <div>
              
              <article>

<p>Let’s open with the controversy: the scripts that live under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> because they are code, <em>not</em> configuration.</p>

<p>This misplacement is something that has bugged me for ages but I never had the energy to open this can of worms back when I was very involved in NetBSD. I suspect it would have been a draining discussion and a very difficult thing to change.</p>

<p>But… what am I talking about anyway?</p>

<p>If you have administered a BSD system, you have certainly encountered the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory; and if you have administered pre-systemd Linux systems, you have dealt with <code>/etc/init.d/</code>. These directories contain startup scripts to configure the system at boot time and are immutable. Their code is parameterized to allow changing their behavior via configuration files, not via code edits. And that’s the base of my critique.</p>

<p>But before getting into why the current state is problematic and how things should look like, let’s first dig into how we got here. And, for that, we need to go back in history.</p>



<p>4.4BSD’s (1993) boot process was rather simple: the kernel started <code>init</code> which in turn ran the <code>/etc/rc</code> script before starting <code>getty</code> on each console. The <code>/etc/rc</code> monolith was in charge of configuring the machine’s file systems and processes, and delegated to two other scripts: <code>/etc/netstart</code> for network configuration and <code>/etc/rc.local</code> for locally-added services. Current BSD systems are more advanced in this area as we shall see later, but the core boot process remains the same: <code>/etc/rc</code> is the primary entry point and bootstraps a collection of shell scripts.</p>

<p>In the early days, package management and file provenance tracking, like we are used to having in popular Linux distributions, was not a thing. You were expected to tune the systems’ behavior by <em>editing</em> files which might or might not have been designed to support edits. If you had to edit <code>/etc/rc</code>, which was a script shipped by the system, that was alright.</p>

<p><code>/etc/rc.local</code>, on the other hard, was <em>not</em> shipped by the system, and it was up to you to create it if you wanted to add custom startup commands without modifying <code>/etc/rc</code>. And this is where things get interesting. <code>/etc/rc.local</code> didn’t need to be supported: if you were expected and able to edit <code>/etc/rc</code> anyway, why would you deal with a separate file? The reason is, most likely, to simplify system upgrades: during an upgrade, you want to benefit from any upstream changes made to <code>/etc/rc</code> (some of which might actually be <em>necessary</em> for proper system operation). Applying updates to a manually-modified file is tricky, so putting as many of your manual overrides into <code>/etc/rc.local</code> helped minimize this problem.</p>



<p>System V 4 (SVR4, 1988) also came with its own, and very different, boot process. The key difference was that System V had the concept of runlevels. As a result, configuring the boot process was a more convoluted endeavour because it was possible to select different services per runlevel.</p>

<p>To accomplish per-runlevel tuning, the system used <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/config-files-vs-directories.html">configuration directories rather than files</a>: there was a separate <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> directory for each runlevel (where <code>X</code> was the number of the runlevel), and these directories contained one file per action to take at startup time. To avoid duplicates, these files were just symlinks to common files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code>—and the symlinks, not their targets, were named so that their lexicographical order determined startup execution order.</p>

<p>Once again, we can already observe issues here: the symlinks under <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> <em>are</em> configuration because their presence indicates what to start and their names determine their startup order. But the files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code> are <em>not</em>: they are shell scripts shipped with the system and should not be manually modified.</p>



<p>NetBSD <a href="http://www.mewburn.net/luke/papers/rc.d.pdf">modernized the boot process</a> in its 1.5 release (2000), and it did so in two ways: first, it introduced <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> as a directory to contain separate scripts per action and service; and, second, it introduced <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcorder+8+NetBSD-9.0-STABLE">the <code>rcorder(8)</code> tool</a> to determine the order in which these services run. <code>rcorder(8)</code> uses dependency information encoded in the scripts as comments—not lexicographical ordering as System V did. FreeBSD <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.1-RELEASE&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html">inherited this design</a> in its 5.0 release (2003) and OpenBSD reimplemented something similar in its 4.9 release (2011).</p>

<p>With these two pieces in place, the <code>/etc/rc</code> script in NetBSD and FreeBSD changed to execute all files from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> based on the output of <code>rcorder(8)</code>. Among these scripts is <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.d/local"><code>/etc/rc.d/local</code></a>, whose purpose is to run <code>/etc/rc.local</code> if it exists. And that’s all, really. The <code>/etc/rc</code> script thus became <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc">trivial</a>.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the scripts shipped in <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are <em>highly configurable</em> via the user-controlled <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.conf"><code>/etc/rc.conf</code></a> file. This essentially makes the scripts read-only, as it shifts local customizations to the configuration file. <em>System administrators are not supposed to edit the scripts.</em> Instead, they are supposed to: modify <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to customize what gets run and how; add new scripts under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> if they so choose; and edit <code>/etc/rc.local</code> to easily run arbitrary commands.</p>



<p>My main gripe is that the files under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are immutable scripts. They do not belong in <code>/etc/</code> and their presence there makes system upgrades harder for no good reason.</p>

<p>You see: in NetBSD and FreeBSD, system upgrades happen by unpacking new distribution sets in the root directory and then running a script to incorporate configuration updates. This script is interactive and helps highlight how new system-provided updates to configuration files conflict with previous manual edits. (This process might seem rudimentary to you, but it’s actually pretty robust and easy to understand—and you can use tooling like <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/sysupgrade/">sysupgrade</a> to make it trivial.)</p>

<p>So why is that a problem? Because you will <em>always</em> face merges like this:</p>

What do you want to do? [Leave it for later]
</code></pre></div>
<p>And, really, who cares? Why are you being distracted to review a <em>code</em> change when what you are trying to do is assess <em>configuration</em> conflicts? How many times have you actually objected to these merges?</p>

<p>You might say: well, I want to know <em>exactly</em> how the boot process of my machine changes during an upgrade. Sure, that’s a fine goal, but then this procedure is flawed and completely insufficient to achieve such goal. In the example above, whatever <code>/etc/rc.d/npf</code> does can also be done from within the <code>/sbin/npfctl</code> binary it invokes… and you were never asked to review changes to the latter during an upgrade, were you? And <em>of course</em> you could review the binary’s code as part of your own system build, but if you did that, then you could have reviewed the startup script as well, right?</p>



<p>Startup scripts provided by the system need to live in a location that can contain executables—but we don’t want those executables to show up in the <code>PATH</code>. These requirements discard <code>bin</code> and <code>sbin</code>, and points us towards <code>libexec</code> on BSD systems and somewhere under <code>lib</code> on Linux.</p>

<p>Therefore, the read-only startup scripts should move from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> (which, by the way, also applies to <code>/etc/rc</code>, <code>/etc/rc.subr</code>, and <code>/etc/rc.shutdown</code>). And that’s it. <del><code>/etc/rc</code></del> <code>/libexec/rc</code> should continue to use <code>rcorder(8)</code> to check what’s needed to run, but it should read files from <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code>. You might even want to support a separate location for user-created services, which might still be <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> or, better yet, a more fitting location like <code>/usr/pkg/libexec/rc.d/</code> (though that quickly runs into problems if you have multiple file systems).</p>

<p>With this design, system upgrades would be much saner because the configuration merge process would focus, purely, on actual configuration changes and not on irrelevant code changes. All updates to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> would be applied by unpacking the new distribution sets (<code>base.txz</code> in this case) without disturbing you about how exactly they changed.</p>

<p>Does this relate to Linux distributions at all? I briefly mentioned <code>/etc/init.d/</code> at the beginning, and the problem there is similar. But it’s also an obsolete problem given that Linux distributions have moved onto systemd by now. That said, systemd still has to manage individual services and, like it or not, has gotten this right. If we look at the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html"><code>systemd.unit(5)</code></a> manual page, which describes where units are loaded from, the system first looks into various <code>/etc/</code> and <code>/run/</code> directories, but then also looks at <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code> (a read-only location correctly controlled by the package manager)—and the vast majority of the scripts live inside the latter.</p>



<p>I currently don’t run BSD systems any more so my incentives to make this happen are low… but if this all makes sense and is something you’d like to pursue, by all means please do! I’m happy to help …</p></article></div></div></div>

"It reminds us that these numbers and the data are dependent&nbsp;on people telling the truth."</p>  <p>O'Connor says in some cases, people who concealed symptoms were afraid of stigma and social judgment, especially if they didn't follow public health guidelines. People who'd concealed symptoms were also less judgmental of other people doing the same.</p>  <p>O'Connor says this shows that shaming people and creating a stigma&nbsp;results in less reliable public health data.</p>  <p>"It's important to not necessarily blame people who are concealing this information, but to understand the barriers that are there from preventing them from telling the truth."</p>  <p>The team conducted the surveys through Amazon in late April and early May.

Most programmers will eventually learn of this pain and all the bugs waiting to take down their software.</p><p>These bugs tend to pop up the most when we’re dealing with time zones, leap dates, and overflow. Time zones and leap dates could each be separate essays on developer pain and anxiety,<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> <!-- -->but for now let's talk about <em>overflow</em>. We’re going to specifically talk about <strong>the next Y2K</strong> known as the 2038 problem.</p><h2>Why Y2K was a problem</h2><p>Let’s clarify something: Y2K was a real problem, but it was blown out of proportion.<sup><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> <!-- -->When the new millennium rolled around a lot of existing bugs had been found and fixed. While some issues were missed, nothing was catastrophic. However, 2038 could be a bigger problem than Y2K.</p><p>Y2K was an issue because of how computers store dates. The problem with Y2K was the years rolling over from 98, 99 ➡️00. This is going to be the same problem in 2038 but the number we use to track time will be the root of the problem.</p><h2>The Unix timestamp</h2><p>Practically all computers track time with the Unix timestamp. This is a counter that started on January 1st 1970 and has been ticking every second since then.</p><p>The current Unix timestamp:<!-- --> <span>1,598,240,362</span></p><h2>Integer overflow</h2><p>Y2K was a known problem because we knew the date was going to roll over from 99 to 00. 2038 is also a known problem for the same reason. The key difference is the date won’t roll over,<!-- --> <strong>the number itself will</strong>.</p><p>In computers we store numbers as integers. Most of these numbers are "signed 32-bit integers". This means numbers in computers have a maximum value that can be stored in memory. The maximum value for a signed 32-bit integer is 2,147,483,647. This means when the unix timestamp gets close to that number it will reset like the Y2K date did and overflow. It’ll go from 2,147,483,646 to 2,147,483,647 to 0 (Technically it goes to -2,147,483,648, but 0 makes the point a little clearer).</p><p>Because this counter is tied to time, we can predict it will happen at exactly 3:14am and 7 seconds on January 19th, 2038 UTC.</p><h2>Gangnam Style</h2><p>A good way of thinking about this problem is to compare it to the<!-- --> <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/12/10/how-gangnam-style-broke-youtubes-counter">Gangnam Style video bug.</a></p><p>At one point Gangnam style got so many views it broke the view counter. It went from 2.1 billion views to -2.1 billion views. This is because YouTube didn't have a number large enough that was capable of storing the view count for the video.</p><h2>How will we fix this problem?</h2><p>Luckily this problem is still 18 years away so no one cares about it right now. I'm guessing everyone will wait until the last minute and then scramble to fix everything.</p><p>A good fix for some groups will be to change how the number is stored. If the number can be stored as a 64-bit integer this will help the immediate issue. This doesn’t fix the problem though, it only kicks the can down the road. But, it kicks the can down 292 billion years from now... That's 20 times longer than the age of the universe so I think that will work.</p><h2>Things will break</h2><p>We may know about this problem almost two decades in advance, but because of the massive amount of software out in the world it will be impossible to prevent every bug.</p><p>A lot of tech is being built with the ability to avoid this problem.

<blockquote>
<p>It pays you not to blink sometimes. It gives you a heck of a fright.</p>

<p>– My grandmother, on rapid change</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Part of Vim’s power is how it can integrate with its environment. It can
interact with external programs, external scripts can interact with Vim, and
Vim is of course scriptable. Here, I’m going to detail an example of weaving
Vim with other applications and the environment to implement a notetaking
methodology that I personally use.</p>

<p>My notetaking has changed a lot over the years, from little to no notetaking (I
don’t recommend!), to experimenting with off-the-shelf tools
(<a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>, <a href="https://standardnotes.org/">Standardnotes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">Vimwiki</a>),
to experimenting with various knowledge management methodologies, to rolling my
own framework for <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">Zettelkasten</a> in Vim. I haven’t yet achieved
the ideal setup, but it’s feeling close, and it’s reached a point where I can
comfortably use it for my needs.</p>

<h3 id="sidenote-create-consume-in-vim">Sidenote: Create + Consume in Vim</h3>

<p>Yes, you did see non-Vim tools in my list of previously used tools for notes…
It should be noted that I was using Vim as my main editor long before I
switched to using Vim to take notes. The reason why is that for a time I knew I
wanted to create and edit notes using Vim, but I wanted to be able to read
those notes in other ways, such as rich text from rendered markdown
(Simplenote), or a wiki that was navigable in a browser (Vimwiki). The times I
used Vim to edit was frustrating, because I needed to fit with a workflow that
required rebuilding a wiki after editing, or opening one file at a time for
something like Simplenote.</p>

<p>Finally, I realized that I didn’t actually need to read rich text or navigate
hyperlinks with a mouse in a browser. I could create <em>and consume</em> in Vim!
Granted, it’s not as pretty for viewing sometimes, but now creating, editing,
searching, and reading notes are all the same thing. Efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</h3>

<p>One more thing to discuss before we dive in - what is Zettelkasten?.
Zettelkasten (German for “card index”) is a method for personal knowledge
management in which one uses many small atomic notes, linked to other such
notes. The idea is that it forms a huge interconnected network of notes one can
traverse and interact with. I came across this methodology a little while back
and love the idea. I haven’t yet spent the time to really learn how to use it
effectively, but I’ve started to use some of the ideas, including linking
between notes and facilitating easy creation of notes.</p>

<p>If you’re interested to know more about Zettelkasten as a system, see
<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">zettelkasten.de</a> and/or web search for it. There are many good
resources. What I described above is only a simplification.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-started">Let’s get started!</h2>

<p>Ok, so now we have a methodology and Vim without any specific notes/wiki
plugins. What do we do now? Let’s work out the workflows involved. So we want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy creation of new notes. It should be frictionless to create and start
editing a new note at any time. More friction equals less motivation to write
up a note.</li>
<li>Powerful options for search. Zettelkasten eschews hierarchy and taxonomy in
favour of flexible search and…</li>
<li>Linking between notes. We need to be able to create a network of small notes,
where we can search to find an entry point, and then traverse notes to
discover related ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-notes">Creating notes</h3>

<p>Obviously I’ll be editing a new note in Vim. There are two main places from
where I want to be able to create a note: the shell and Vim itself. It must be
as frictionless as possible to create new notes; any friction will dissuade me
from taking a note at once, and thoughts are fleeting.</p>

<p>So, from inside Vim, I have a command and function to create a timestamped file
in my notes directory:</p>

<pre><code>" .vim/plugin/local.vim
command! -nargs=* Zet call local#zettel#edit(&lt;f-args&gt;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>" .vim/autoload/local/zettel.vim
func! local#zettel#edit(...)

  " build the file name
  let l:sep = ''
  if len(a:000) &gt; 0
    let l:sep = '-'
  endif
  let l:fname = expand('~/wiki/') . strftime("%F-%H%M") . l:sep . join(a:000, '-') . '.md'

  " edit the new file
  exec "e " . l:fname

  " enter the title and timestamp (using ultisnips) in the new file
  if len(a:000) &gt; 0
    exec "normal ggO\&lt;c-r&gt;=strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\&lt;cr&gt; " . join(a:000) . "\&lt;cr&gt;\&lt;esc&gt;G"
  else
    exec "normal ggO\&lt;c-r&gt;=strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\&lt;cr&gt;\&lt;cr&gt;\&lt;esc&gt;G"
  endif
endfunc
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create a new titled, timestamped note directly in Vim: <code>:Zet a new
note</code> to edit (for example) <code>~/wiki/2019-12-21-0945-a-new-note.md</code>.</p>

<p>It’s possible to instruct Vim to execute a command on launch, so we can write a
shell function with the same api as the <code>:Zet</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>zet() {
  nvim "+Zet $*"
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>$ zet a new note</code> will produce the same result as the example above from
in Vim.</p>

<p>It would be just as easy to develop entry points to creating notes from
elsewhere in the environment, but since I spend a lot of time either in Vim or
have multiple shell sessions open, most of the time a neat new note is only a
few keystrokes away.</p>

<h3 id="linking-notes">Linking notes</h3>

<p>Now we have some notes, we need to link them together.</p>

<p>Here, I stray from vanilla Vim, and lean on a couple of popular plugins:
<a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/">Ultisnips</a> to shortcut inserting custom syntax and
<a href="https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim">Deoplete</a> to auto-complete paths to other notes.</p>

<p>Before we go into the code, let’s see what the end result looks like:</p>





<p>Now the code! I use a syntax similar to Vimwiki to denote internal links, which
are simply paths to other note files in the notes directory, with the extension
removed for readability.</p>

<pre><code>" .vim/UltiSnips/markdown.snippets
snippet h "hyperlink"
[[$1]]$0
endsnippet
</code></pre>

<p>With this snippet, and the Deoplete configuration that comes next, The
keysequence <code>h&lt;snippet-trigger&gt;</code> enters the syntax and opens a fuzzy
autocomplete for other notes. Two key strokes is my definition of low friction.
:)</p>

<p>And this is the (abridged) Deoplete source plugin to list all files in my notes directory.</p>

<pre><code># .vim/rplugin/python3/deoplete/sources/wiki_files.py
class Source(Base):
    def __init__(self, vim):
        self.name = 'wiki_files'
        self.mark = '[WL]' # WikiLink
        self.min_pattern_length = 0
        self.rank = 450
        # only activate for files in my notes directory
        self.filetypes = ['privwiki']

    def get_complete_position(self, context):
        # trigger completion if we're currently in the [[link]] syntax
        pos = context['input'].rfind('[[')
        return pos if pos &lt; 0 else pos + 2

    def gather_candidates(self, context):
        contents = []
        path = '/home/swalladge/wiki/'
        # now gather all note files, and return paths relative to the current
        # note's directory.
        cur_file_dir = dirname(self.vim.buffers[context['bufnr']].name)
        for fname in glob.iglob(path + '**/*', recursive=True):
            fname = relpath(fname, cur_file_dir)
            if fname.endswith('.md'):
                fname = fname[:-3]
            contents.append(fname)
        return contents
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we can still use Vim’s built in <code>gf</code> (goto file) mapping to follow
the link - see <a href="https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27suffixesadd%27">:h ‘suffixesadd’</a>. The more we can do in Vim
builtins, the better - it’s familiar, portable, maintained.</p>

<h3 id="search">Search</h3>

<p>Now the third and final point: searching. This is one of my favourite points as
there are so many possibilities!</p>

<p>Search is core to being able to effectively <em>consume</em> notes (as opposed to
<em>creating</em> notes, as the previous points have been mainly about). For me, there
are 3 entry points to search and 3 types of search. The following points aren’t
core to Zettelkasten, but is core for me to be able to pinpoint a certain note
quickly. YMMV.</p>

<p>By “entry points”, I mean where I want to start a search from. These are:</p>

<ol>
<li>the desktop (ie. anywhere)</li>
<li>the shell</li>
<li>Vim itself</li>
</ol>

<p>Types of search:</p>

<ol>
<li>fuzzy find by title</li>
<li>grep file contents</li>
<li>search-engine-style search</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that wherever these searches begin, and whatever methods are used, they
always end up in Vim and a way to navigate between search results in Vim.</p>

<p>Ok, so fuzzy find by title is done from the window manager with</p>

<pre><code># ~/.config/i3/config
bindsym Mod4+w exec --no-startup-id open-wiki-page
</code></pre>

<p>And the corresponding script that launches a graphical fuzzy finder which is
used to select a wiki file to open in a new terminal window:</p>

<pre><code>~/bin/open-wiki-page
cd "$HOME/wiki"

if [ -n "$WAYLAND_DISPLAY" ]; then
  file=$(rg --files --follow | bemenu --fn 'Hack 11' -p "wiki:" -i -l 20)
else
  file=$(rg --files --follow | rofi -dmenu -no-custom  -i -p "wiki")
fi

[[ -n "$file" ]] || exit

exec termite -e "nvim \"$file\""
</code></pre>

<p>Fuzzy find from inside Vim is done using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> and a mapping:</p>

<pre><code>" ~/.vim/after/plugin/local.vim
map &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;ww :FZF ~/wiki&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Grepping contents of wiki files is done using Vim’s builtin <code>:grep</code> command

  let l:cmd = 'searchr ' . l:which_index . " search -l 15 " . l:query . ""
  let l:files = split(system(l:cmd), "\n")
  let l:qffiles = []

    call add(l:qffiles, {'filename': f})
  endfor
  call setqflist(l:qffiles)

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Vim is a powerful tool, but some of it’s power comes not because it takes over
the environment, but because it can blend seamlessly with it’s environment and
bend to fit your workflow.</p>

<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/
Alg   Cost                  Salt                                            Hash</pre>

<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]
      block ^= saltHalf[(i-1) mod 2]

	  // Encrypt block using current key schedule with blowfish block encryption
	  block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block)
	  
	  // Split block and use as new subkeys
      pEighteenSubkeys[2*i] = block[0:31]
	  pEighteenSubkeys[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
   }

   // Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state
   for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i ++ {
      for j := 0; j &lt; 127; j++ {
		// Encrypt block using blowfish block encryption
		// where salt[i] is 64 bit chunks
        block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block ^ salt[i])
        sFourSubBoxes[2*i] = block[0:31]
		sFourSubBoxes[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
	  }
	}
    return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>
        Lean server is a HTTP server written in Gleam (Gleam is a new type safe language for the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM)).
        Lean is the built-in server for the <a href="https://github.com/midas-framework/midas">Midas Web Framework</a>
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        import midas/lean.{MaxConcurrency}
        import gleam/http

        fn handle(_request) {
          http.response(200)
          |&gt; http.set_body("Hello, World!")
        }

        fn start_link() {
          lean.start_link(handle, 8080, [MaxConcurrency(100000)])
        }
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Why Lean?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple to use</li>
        <li>Simple to maintain</li>
        <li>Fast, hopefully</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lean incorperates the lessons I learnt while developing <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/ace">Ace</a> and <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/raxx">Raxx</a>.
        Ace is a HTTP server written in Elixir that aimed to abstract away the differences between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.
        Ace also supported HTTPS and long lived connections for streaming requests/responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion Ace was successful in its goals.
        However, having all these features in one server increased the implementation complexity.
        Since starting Ace I have written several services that use the same narrow subset of features.
        These applications were mostly JSON API services, they did not have streaming.
        Being deployed behind a load balancer, they needed neither HTTPS or HTTP/2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lean aims to be focus on these API applications and has a sizeable list of non-goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SSL</li>
        <li>Streaming</li>
        <li>HTTP/2</li>
        <li>HTTP Pipelining</li>
        <li>Websockets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By not tackling all these non-goals Lean should be simpler and therefore easier to maintain.
        This should make it easier to address features and bugs, as well as easier to contribute to.
        It should also be faster, though I have yet to test this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, all the features listed above are important for a framework.
        By writing adapters for other servers, such as Ace or Cowboy,
        Midas the framework will be able to support all these features.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Gleam</h2>
      <p>
        For now Gleam feels like the most promising approach to getting the benefits of types on the BEAM.
        This is something that has been on several peoples wish list, including mine, for quite a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gleam compiles to readable Erlang (if "readable Erlang" isn't a controversial statement)
        It also has great interop with Erlang and Elixir.
        Because of these features I would argue that it can be considered "production ready",
        if only for parts of an application.
        There are some parts of your application that will benefit more from type safety than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will write more on this topic at some later time.
      </p>
      <h2>Using Lean Server</h2>
      <p>
        Lean Sever is bundled as part of Midas.
        Currently Midas is using features that are not yet part of a Gleam stable release,
        therefore you will need to use it as a git dependency from `midas-framework/midas`.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>With Elixir and Mix. <a href="https://github.com/midas-framework/midas#start-in-an-elixir-application">See the docs</a>.</li>
        <li>With Erlang and Rebar3. <a href="https://github.com/midas-framework/midas#start-in-an-erlang-application">See the docs</a>.</li>

I programmed in three different languages and kept notes to help me context switch between different <strong>programming languages</strong>. I also did full-stack development on the side and that, well, it required referencing <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/747hfu/does_everybody_find_the_modern_fullstack_learning/">everything</a></strong>.</p> <p>My primary use for notes is as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">cache</a>. Think <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, but for humans.</p> <p>If I spent <strong>more than 5 minutes</strong> figuring something out, those are five minutes I <strong>never</strong> want to spend again figuring out the <strong>same problem</strong>.</p> <p>But this is difficult to do in practice.</p> <p>Sometimes you run into a thing that only pops up on some specific version of a cli command on an outdated bash shell on a specific Linux distro. How do you document this sort of thing when you might encounter a dozen of them a day?</p> <p>My solution is something I call <strong>hierarchal note taking</strong>. It’s a system I’ve developed over the past ten years that has allowed me to amass a corpus of +10k notes.</p> <p>This system has some awesome properties that I haven’t been able to replicate with anything else:</p> <ul> <li>it lets me <strong>find any specific note within seconds</strong> even with thousands of existing notes</li> <li>it helps me build a <strong>comprehensive mental model</strong> around a domain through the act of organizing my notes</li> <li>it <strong>can be used on any note-taking tool that supports markdown notes</strong></li> <li>it’s compatible with existing note-taking methodologies like <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">PARA</a></li> </ul> <p>The rest of this post will describe the journey I took to arrive at hierarchal note-taking and the problems that they help me solve.</p> <h2 id="the-problem-with-clis"> <a href="#the-problem-with-clis" aria-labelledby="the-problem-with-clis"></a> The Problem with CLIs </h2> <p>I spend a lot of time in the command line in Unix-like systems. If you do as well, you might be familiar with the following comic.</p> <p><img src="https://www.kevinslin.com/assets/images/2020-06-09-15-11-27.png" alt="tar bomb"></p> <blockquote> <p>Comic from <a href="https://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a></p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve probably used <code>tar</code> a few thousand times in my life but still can’t tell you what the arguments mean (it’s mostly muscle memory at this point). Unix tools do one thing and one thing well, and on most days, that one thing is making you reach for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man page</a>.</p> <p>This is because every command has many dozen options, many of which are invoked with obscure single character letters in a specific order for specific inputs (I’m looking at you <code>rsync</code>).</p> <p>Growing tired of reading man pages and stack overflow threads, I wanted a way to capture and reference commands that I’ve run in the past. And so I started taking notes.</p> <p>I created a folder called <code>notes</code>. I created a note called <code>tar.md</code>.</p>  <p>Note that my <code>tar.md</code> note doesn’t have every option or use case involving <code>tar</code>. Instead, it’s only the options that I find most useful and use cases that I’ve had to do. This tends to be my approach to note-taking - I like to capture the bare minimum information I need so that the future me can get value out of the note.</p> <p>What started as a single markdown file quickly spawned a few hundred more. It was exhilarating - instead of turning to google every time I ran into a dusty corner of Linux, I could just reference my notes. 95% of the time, there would be a nicely summarized note waiting for me :)</p> <h2 id="the-problem-with-languages"> <a href="#the-problem-with-languages" aria-labelledby="the-problem-with-languages"></a> The Problem with Languages </h2> <p>While the above approach worked for cli commands, things got more complicated as I needed notes on additional domains. Most commonly with my work, it was programming languages.</p> <p>Take <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> as an example. Python is both a <strong>programming language</strong> as well as a <strong>cli command</strong>. Without changing the name of one of the notes or introducing folders, there would be no way to create notes on both.</p> <p>But I didn’t want folders. Folders were messy and besides, weren’t supported in <a href="http://notational.net/">notational velocity</a>, my primary note-taking tool at the time. So instead of folders, I decided to create a hierarchy using the <code>.</code> symbol as my delimiter.</p> <p>Now I could represent the language and the cli as two different <code>.</code> delimited hierarchies.</p> <div><div><pre><code>cli.python.md
lang.python.md
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Though on the surface, this seems like a simple change and not all that different from a traditional folder hierarchy, I found that it equal to the difference between using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">commodore 64</a> and the latest (non-<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design">butterfly keyboard</a>) Macbook.</p> <p>For starters, files now had the ability to both contain data and have children. They could act as both files and folders.</p> <p>And whereas folders were traditionally used to <strong>organize</strong> information, there was no straightforward way to use a folder hierarchy to quickly <strong>find</strong> information. Having the hierarchy in the filename made it easy to <strong>find</strong> information using the <strong>hierarchy</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif" alt="cli lookup"></p> <h2 id="finding-the-truth"> <a href="#finding-the-truth" aria-labelledby="finding-the-truth"></a> Finding the Truth </h2> <p>There’s the joke in computer science that there are only 3 meaningful quantities in the field: 0, 1 or infinite. If you can create a thing more than once, there is nothing in theory that should stop you from creating an infinite amount of said thing.</p> <p>Once I realized I had a system of making two-level hierarchies, I realized I didn’t need to stop there. This soon led to deeper hierarchies like the one below.</p> <div><div><pre><code>.

But now I don’t have to.</p> <p><img src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/blog.lookup.bool.gif" alt="finding the truth"></p> <blockquote> <p>Finding the truth</p> </blockquote> <p>The cool thing about this approach is that the implementation details of any particular language became less important as I build out my hierarchies. Instead of thinking in terms of “how well do I understand <strong>python</strong>”, I think in terms of how well I understand <strong>programming languages</strong>.</p> <h2 id="externalizing-mental-models"> <a href="#externalizing-mental-models" aria-labelledby="externalizing-mental-models"></a> Externalizing Mental Models </h2> <p>As I started building hierarchies across more and more domains, I found that it became useful to document what they were. I called these <em>externalized hierarchies</em> <strong>schemas</strong>. They were a table of contents for a particular hierarchy. I started adding a special <code>schema</code> file directly underneath the root of each hierarchy.</p> <div><div><pre><code>lang.schema.md
cli.schema.md
aws.schema.md
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Inside each <code>schema</code> note, I would have something like the following</p> <div><div><pre><code>- lang (namespace) # indicates that there are any number of languages underneath here
    - data: data structures
    - flow: control flow
    - oo: object-oriented programming
    - ...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I would use schemas as a common source of truth when building out a hierarchy and use them to make sure that each hierarchy was internally consistent. As I began to use this system day by day, I realized that I had stumbled upon a radically more effective way of learning.</p> <h2 id="hierarchal-notes"> <a href="#hierarchal-notes" aria-labelledby="hierarchal-notes"></a> Hierarchal Notes </h2> <p>By associating every note I took to a hierarchy, I found that looking up information no longer felt like an <strong>tax on my time</strong>, but instead, a <strong>path to self augmentation</strong>.</p> <p>Whereas before I would look up a thing only to forget it a few weeks later, I could now quickly incorporate it into my notes and <strong>know with certainty</strong> that I will be able to <strong>reference this again</strong> at a later date.</p> <p>Better yet, when I found something that didn’t fit any of my existing hierarchies, I could use it as a chance to update my schemas on said hierarchies. This would slowly expand my conceptual understanding of the entire domain.</p> <p>A concrete example: earlier this year, I ended up making use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator">null coalescing operator</a> in javascript. This is a convenient way of assigning values when dealing with <code>null</code></p> <p>In the following example, <code>a</code> will be assigned the value of <code>b</code> if the value of <code>b</code> is not <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, otherwise, it will be assigned 3.</p>  <p>After learning about it, I added it to my language schema under <code>operators</code>.</p> <div><div><pre><code>- lang (namespace)
    - {specific language}
        - operator (alias: op)
            - add
            - subtract
            - ...
            - null # null coalescing operator
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Not only did this expand my vocabulary of language operators, but it also let me note down how the equivalent functionality can be expressed in languages that did not natively support it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>other</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span> <span>or</span> <span>"some default value"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <blockquote> <p>Python example of “null coalescing”</p> </blockquote> <p>What is nice about this approach is that I have completely divorced the concept of “null coalescing” with the implementation detail of any particular language. The next time I’m using python and want to do <code>null coalescing</code>, I can simply look up <code>python.op.null</code> and be reminded of the implementation.</p> <p>There are dozens of <strong>main stream</strong> programming languages. There are hundreds of additional domain-specific languages. In a prior life, there would have been no way for me to <strong>know</strong> even a tiny fraction of them. But a hierarchal first approach to note-taking changes the game - instead of having to know the details of <strong>every</strong> language, I can collapse it all down to my <strong>one language schema</strong>. This schema can capture the points of interest of <strong>every language</strong> and in this way, I can claim to <strong>know</strong> something of all programming languages.</p> <h2 id="the-present-day"> <a href="#the-present-day" aria-labelledby="the-present-day"></a> The Present Day </h2> <p>Today, my knowledge base encompasses over a dozen different hierarchies that span 10K+ notes.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>A Ruby object is represented by an <code>RVALUE</code> struct instance. The <code>RVALUE</code> struct is exactly 40 bytes in size (on systems with 8 byte pointers). These struct instances live in 40 byte slots in a (generally 16KB) page. These pages exist as a linked list inside a heap.</p> <p>The <code>RVALUE</code> struct can represent any Ruby object using a union of all the types for Ruby objects (such as <code>RObject</code>, <code>RString</code>, <code>RRegexp</code>, <code>RFloat</code>, etc.). It also contains <code>imemo</code>, which is a union of internal types that are not represented by Ruby objects. <code>imemo</code> includes types such as <code>rb_iseq_t</code> which are instruction sequences used to hold the instructions for Ruby code (like a method or a block).</p> <p>We can use the <code>values</code> struct inside to initialize a generic <code>RVALUE</code>. This struct contains an <code>RBasic</code> struct, which is 16 bytes and contains information about the type of the current object and so we can use the remaining 24 bytes for data (<code>VALUE</code> is a type definition for an <code>unsigned long</code>). The 24 bytes of data is used differently for different types. For example, a short string has the characters directly embedded while a longer string utilizes a pointer.</p> <h2 id="rb_objspace_t-struct"> <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L650"><code>rb_objspace_t</code> struct</a> <a href="#rb_objspace_t-struct"></a> </h2> <p>The <code>rb_objspace_t</code> struct contains all the information about the garbage collector, including pointers to the heaps and the state of the garbage collector.</p> <p>The instance of <code>rb_objspace_t</code> can be accessed using the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L862"><code>rb_objspace</code> macro</a>.</p> <p>The garbage collector contains two heaps, <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L679"><code>eden_heap</code> and <code>tomb_heap</code></a>. The eden heap contains pages containing live objects while the tomb heap contains pages without live objects, which can then get recycled and moved back to the eden heap. The pages in the tomb heap may also be freed to release memory back to the system.</p> <h2 id="heap-page"> Heap page <a href="#heap-page"></a> </h2> <p>The heap is divided up into pages, with each page at 16KB. These pages are further divided up into slots, where each slot holds one <code>RVALUE</code>. When we run out of pages, we malloc another page and add it to the list of pages. We free pages when we have too many empty pages (this can happen when a GC run sweeps all the live objects on a page).</p>  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2226"><code>rb_wb_unprotected_newobj_of</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2233"><code>rb_wb_protected_newobj_of</code></a> are the public functions used to create new objects. I’ll talk about the difference between these two functions later. In other Ruby source files, the macros <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.h#L29"><code>NEWOBJ_OF</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.h#L33"><code>RB_NEWOBJ_OF</code></a> are used to create objects. An example of this being used is in <code>numeric.c</code> in <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/numeric.c#L906"><code>rb_float_new_in_heap</code></a> that creates a new floating point number.</p> <h2 id="newobj_of-function"> <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2194"><code>newobj_of</code> function</a> <a href="#newobj_of-function"></a> </h2> <p>The <code>newobj_of</code> function allocates and initializes a new object (i.e. slot) on the heap.</p> <p>If we are not in a GC run, the GC is not stressful (when the GC is stressful, it will attempt to run garbage collection at every possible point), and there is a free slot available in the page we are using, then we can directly pop this free slot from the linked list and initialize the object in it.</p> <p>However, if the conditions are not satisfied, we run <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2154"><code>newobj_slowpath</code></a>, which tries to use the next free page and then fetch a free slot from this new page (this is done in <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2019"><code>heap_get_freeobj</code></a>). However, this would not work if we run out of pages, so we call <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L1966"><code>heap_prepare</code></a> and run garbage collection to try to free up space. If we still do not have space, then we add a new page to the heap (by calling <code>heap_increment</code>).</p> <p>Incremental marking occurs during object creation in <code>newobj_slowpath</code> (incremental marking is explained later on). To be specific, it happens in <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2172"><code>heap_get_freeobj</code></a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L2030"><code>heap_get_freeobj_from_next_freepage</code></a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L1991"><code>heap_prepare</code></a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L1974"><code>gc_marks_continue</code></a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L6566"><code>gc_marks_step</code></a>.</p>  <p>The garbage collector is split into two phases: it first marks, then sweeps (and a third compaction phase that is currently in development).</p> <p>In the marking phase, living objects are marked in a bitmap. Then, during the sweeping phase, the unmarked slots are freed and recycled in the free list.</p> <p>As you may know, MRI Ruby is single threaded, and the garbage collector is no different. This is known as a “stop-the-world” garbage collector. This can cause long pauses in the Ruby code when the garbage collector is running, especially in a large Rails app, for example. Ruby solves this problem using two solutions, incrementally marking objects, and using a generational garbage collector, both described in greater detail below.</p>  <p>The marking phase traverses live Ruby objects by recursively marking children of live Ruby objects starting from root objects. Objects are marked using three colors: white, grey, and black. At a high level, the tri-color marking algorithm works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>All objects are initially white.</li> <li>Mark root objects as grey.</li> <li>While there is another object <em>O</em> that is grey: <ol> <li>Mark <em>O</em> as black.</li> <li>Mark every child <em>C</em> of <em>O</em> as grey.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>At the end of the marking phase, there are only black and white objects and all live objects that are white are dead and can be swept.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/notes-on-ruby-gc/marking.jpg"> <figcaption>Illustration of marking Ruby objects.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In the figure above, objects A and B are marked black, while objects C and D are grey, and object E has not yet been marked. We also have object F that is not referenced by any Ruby objects, so won’t be marked and will be reclaimed during the sweeping phase. We also two free slots that are currently unused.</p> <h2 id="generational-garbage-collector"> Generational garbage collector <a href="#generational-garbage-collector"></a> </h2> <p>Generational garbage collectors are based on the <em>weak generational hypothesis</em> theory, which states that objects often die young, and objects that have been alive for a long time are likely to remain alive. Generational garbage collectors keep track of the number of garbage collection cycles a particular object has survived, and when this number exceeds a threshold, the object is marked as an old object. To take advantage of this property to improve performance, we have two types of marking: minor GC and major GC.</p> <p>Minor GC runs mark only the young objects, thus it can run faster by skipping old objects.</p> <p>Major GC runs mark both the young and old objects, thus it can free more memory.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/notes-on-ruby-gc/rgengc.jpg"> <figcaption>Illustration of generational garbage collector during a minor GC.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In the figure above, when we are in a minor GC, none of the descendants of object A will be traversed during marking.</p> <p>The number of generations an object has survived is stored in the flags in the <code>RBasic</code> struct. We can get the age of the object using <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L1192"><code>RVALUE_FLAGS_AGE</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L1373"><code>RVALUE_OLD_P_RAW</code></a> which returns the age and whether an object is old, respectively.</p> <h3 id="remember-set-and-write-barrier"> Remember set and write barrier <a href="#remember-set-and-write-barrier"></a> </h3> <p>What if we added a child (that is a young object) to an old object? Then during minor GC the young object would not be marked and thus will be swept. This is a really bad bug.</p> <p>Here’s a diagram to illustrate the bug.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/notes-on-ruby-gc/wb1.jpg"> <figcaption>Illustration of potential bug in generational garbage collector.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In the diagram above, since objects A and C are old, they are not traversed during marking. However, object E is a young descendant of object C. Since object E is never marked, it will be swept.</p> <p>To solve this issue, we introduce the concept of a write barrier. A write barrier is essentially a “callback” to let the garbage collector know whenever an object is written to. When the write barrier is called, the child (young object) is placed in a special list called the remember set. This remember set is marked during minor GC runs.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/notes-on-ruby-gc/wb2.jpg"> <figcaption>Illustration of using write barrier to add object E to the remember set.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Generational garbage collection was introduced in Ruby 2.1. To preserve backward compatibility with old C-extensions, Ruby supports a write barrier unprotect operation. When we write barrier unprotect an object, we mark the object as shady and keep it in the remember set. Shady objects are not allowed to be promoted to old generation, so thus shady objects will always be marked during both minor and major GC.</p> <p>If you’re interested in more details, Koichi Sasada has <a href="http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/activities/rgengc_ismm.pdf">an excellent paper</a> written about implementing gradual write barriers.</p> <h2 id="incremental-marking"> Incremental marking <a href="#incremental-marking"></a> </h2> <p>Ruby 2.2 introduced the incremental garbage collector. Koichi Sasada has an <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/incremental-gc">execellent article</a> explaining how the incremental garbage collector works, I will attempt to summarize it below.</p> <p>The main idea of incremental marking is to not run the marking phase all at once, but divide it into chunks that can be interleaved with the execution of Ruby code. Since Ruby has a stop-the-world GC (i.e. no Ruby code can run while the GC is running), so splitting the marking phase can significantly reduce the stutter caused by GC execution.</p> <p>Incremental marking marks only a certain number of slots before completing, so during the execution of Ruby code, some objects may be marked black, some may be marked grey, while some may not have been marked yet at all. The number of slots that is incrementally marked is stored in the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L6300"><code>step_slots</code> field</a>.</p> <p>Incremental marking only occurs during major GC runs, as we can see in <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/38a4f617de157586668dd726d518eadcebf1bca2/gc.c#L6588"><code>gc_marks</code></a> (the code completes marking if we are not incrementally marking).</p> <h3 id="write-barrier-part-ii"> Write barrier, part II <a href="#write-barrier-part-ii"></a> </h3> <p>A corner case that we run into during incremental marking is when a young object is added as a child of an old object, so during a minor GC run, this young object is not marked as live, and thus is swept even though it should not be. This is a very similar issue we …</p></div></article></div></div>

        <p>
          <span>By Eric Holscher, David Fischer on </span>
          <time datetime="2020-08-24T00:00:00-07:00">Aug 24</time>
        </p>

          

        <p>We're excited to announce the release of EthicalAds,
a privacy-focused ad network for developers.
We think advertising is one of the best ways to fund open source development,
and we have first hand experience.
Ethical advertising was first created to make Read the Docs,
our own open source project,
sustainable.
We're now bringing ethical ads to other developers.</p>
<p>We've found that privacy preserving ads are a win for both developers and advertisers.
Advertisers are able to target developers on the sites they frequent without being blocked.
Developers trust our ads because our code is open source, and we're developers ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="the-background">The background</h2>
<p>Ethical advertising as a concept was something we <a href="https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/#funding-read-the-docs">originally conceived</a> for Read the Docs back in 2016.
We were an open source project trying to find sustainability,
and advertising was the answer we knew we needed.
We knew our users cared about privacy,
so we decided to build the most privacy-focused ad solution we could.
We have been working on building a sturdy business around advertising ever since.</p>
<p>As we started building this vision,
we were inspired to see CodeFund adopt our ideals and push them forward.
We were sad when we heard CodeFund was <a href="https://twitter.com/codefundio/status/1278119643937296384">shutting down</a> on July 1 of this year.
We talked with Eric Berry at CodeFund,
deciding to launch our network in beta to provide a smooth transition for the people depending on that money each month.</p>
<p>We've spent the last month onboarding over 50 publishers.
<strong>Developers have already earned more than $5,000 since we launched</strong>.
We're excited to officially announce that we're open for additional publishers and advertisers.</p>
<h2 id="our-vision">Our vision</h2>
<p>Ethical ads respect users while still providing value to advertisers.
The vision is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t track you or sell your data</li>
<li>We only make money showing ads, so our interests are fully aligned</li>
<li>We target ads based on the content of the current page, not your past browsing history</li>
<li>We are as transparent in our business as possible</li>
<li>We only show high quality ads from companies that are of interest to developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we talked about in our <a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ethical-advertising-works/">2018 blog post</a>: <strong>ethical advertising works</strong>.
We're thrilled to be able to bring our vision of advertising to a larger audience,
and help fund open source without compromise.
Our <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server">entire ad server</a> is open source,
so you can inspect how we're doing things.
We believe strongly in open source,
and we practice what we preach.</p>
<h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>
<p>We are planning to grow slowly in the near term,
making sure that everything we've built is ready for new demands.
We've already learned a number of lessons in the last month,
and we want to make sure our ads work well for everyone.</p>
<p>Ethical advertising is our vision for the future of internet advertising,
and we hope that you'll join us.
We have space for additional publishers and advertisers,
and look forward to building something meaningful with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become a <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/">publisher</a> today</li>
<li>Become an <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/">advertiser</a> today</li>
<li>Follow our journey in our <a href="https://ethicalads.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ca5e74de3ea2867d373058271&amp;id=5746f18bb8">newsletter</a></li>

<p><strong>16 August 2020 | Luis F. De Pombo, David Ellis</strong></p>
<p>Programming languages are useful not only for what they allow, but what they prevent. That is the key separation between a language and a framework. For good or for ill, a framework can be sidestepped by its users while a language can't.</p>
<p>This overview of Alan will emphasize just as much what it prevents you from doing as what it provides to you. We believe our blend of features and omissions is what general purpose computing needs in the multicore era.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-alan-provides" id="what-alan-provides">What Alan Provides</a></h2>
<p>Alan is a natively-parallel, statically-compiled, type-inferred, evented language with a familiar syntax and many compile-time and run-time safety guarantees.</p>
<h3><a href="#implicitly-parallel" id="implicitly-parallel">Implicitly Parallel</a></h3>
<p>Alan's compiler and runtime automatically recognizes and exploits the parallelism inherent to the computations expressed by some of the language's constructs and automatically managing IO and compute threadpools.</p>
<p><strong>Parallelism over events</strong> is accomplished via the static event system baked into the language:</p>
<pre><code>on http.connection fn (conn: http.Connection) {
  let res: http.Request = conn.res
  res.body("Hello, World!").status(200).send()
}
</code></pre>
<p>Independent connections to the HTTP server are scheduled onto the event loop and the compute threadpool pulls them from the queue and executes them in parallel.</p>
<p><strong>Parallelism over arrays</strong> is accomplished by default through natively-parallel array operations:</p>
<pre><code>someLargeArray
  .filter(fn (val: SomeType): bool = val &gt; someDefaultVal)
  .map(fn (val: SomeType): float64 = val.innerNumber * 3.14159)
  .reduce(fn (acc: float64, cur: float64): float64 = acc + cur)
  .print()
</code></pre>
<p>If the array is large enough and the inner function given to it is pure, each of these steps will run in parallel, utilizing all of the CPU cores on the machine.</p>
<p><strong>IO Concurrency</strong> is accomplished by eagerly running IO-bound opcodes within the runtime based on the dependency graph of statements:</p>
<pre><code>const data: Result&lt;string&gt; = http.get("https://someurl.com/csvfile.csv")
const datacsv: Array&lt;Array&lt;int64&gt;&gt; = (data || '').split('\n').map(fn (row: string): Array&lt;int64&gt; = row.split(',').map(toInt64))
const data2: Result&lt;string&gt;  = http.get("https://someotherdatasource.org/othercsvfile.csv")
const data2csv: Array&lt;Array&lt;int64&gt;&gt; = (data2 || '').split('\n').map(fn (row: string): Array&lt;int64&gt; = row.split(',').map(toInt64))
// Compare the data...
</code></pre>
<p>The Alan runtime will see that the two URL fetches do not depend on each other and can run in parallel, so they will be hoisted to the top of the function call, executed in parallel, and the function execution continues after they return, minimizing overall latency and scheduling costs.</p>
<h3><a href="#statically-compiled-benefits-and-compile-time-safety" id="statically-compiled-benefits-and-compile-time-safety">Statically Compiled Benefits and Compile-Time Safety</a></h3>
<p>Alan has a multi-stage compiler with two compile targets: It's own native AGC bytecode format to be run by its native runtime, and Javascript to allow running in Node.js or the browser.</p>
<p>This will make it possible to make full-stack web applications in Alan that can also be ejected to Javascript if you no longer wish to develop in Alan. ("Will" because the cross-compiler's primary focus has been on correctness, not legibility, of the generated Javascript, but that will improve over time. Also because Alan bindings to Web APIs have not yet been written.)</p>
<p>Being statically compiled brings lots of benefits (and a few drawbacks) to the table. Primarily, the compiler can spot and prevent many classes of trivial errors from getting into production, but at the expense of requiring a compilation step between checking the changes made to your code.</p>
<p>However, Alan takes the safety guarantees to a higher level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No <code>undefined</code> variables, ever:</strong> In Alan, <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> declared variables <em>must</em> be given an initial value. Potentially missing data can be represented with a <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code> type, but then the compiler will force checking for the presence of actual data or providing a default value if not present. Downstream logic can be assured that the type they are working with is real.</li>
<li><strong>Most runtime errors impossible:</strong> Out of memory errors are impossible to avoid, but other issues, such as divide-by-zero, integer under/overflow, array out-of-bounds accesses, etc, are not possible in Alan. Actions that could have runtime errored in other languages are converted into <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> types that have to be checked for an error condition and/or have a default value provided instead. (The default set of math operators return <code>Result</code>-wrapped values and can accept such values in place of raw integers or floats, but there is also a second set of math operators copying Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/intrinsics/fn.saturating_add.html">saturating arithmetic</a> mechanism that always works on raw integers or floats, and will produce predictable but potentially unexpected values when a runtime error would have been reached, otherwise.)</li>
<li><strong>Deadlocks, Livelocks, and other multithreading issues impossible:</strong> There is no explicit multithreading in Alan. The compiler determines what code you have written is safely parallelizable does this for you. As Alan's compiler and runtime become more intelligent, more code will become parallelized, but with most array operations already being parallelizable as well as all events, the majority of the parallelization possibilities are already covered.</li>
<li><strong>No shared, mutable state:</strong> Alan defers all such responsibility to databases and caching systems that have had decades of work behind them and many tradeoffs between different mechanisms. We may revisit this if we can bring something to the table here with a significant advantage and minimal downsides in the future, however.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#third-party-module-permission-system" id="third-party-module-permission-system">Third-Party Module Permission System</a></h3>
<p>Beyond direct code and syntax safety guarantees, Alan also provides safety mechanisms on third-party modules. Alan's module resolution mechanism includes built-in support for <a href="https://docs.alan-lang.org/module_testing.html">defining mocks</a> and, more importantly, <a href="https://docs.alan-lang.org/module_mutation.html">defining mutations</a> of existing modules. This mechanism can be used to deny third party libraries access to parts of the standard library you are not comfortable with. By simply creating a <code>modules</code> directory within the third-party dependency and then defining an <code>std/app.ln</code> file that re-exports non-functional versions of the types, functions, and events of the original standard library, you can prevent that library from being able to use standard library features you would not expect them to have access to. For instance, if you have imported a very popular utility library for, say, curve fitting. You would not expect it to want to have access to your filesystem or creating a child process, so you could inject nonfunctional mocks of <code>@std/fs</code> and <code>@std/cmd</code>.</p>
<p>This causes the third party code to be compiled without the opcodes it needs to access that functionality at all, providing a defense-in-depth that can be applied along with standard auditing, package signing, and CVE reporting on open source projects. Making this behavior easy-to-use automatically through the package management system is a project goal that will provide users of Alan a layer of security no other project approaches.</p>
<h3><a href="#memory-management" id="memory-management">Memory Management</a></h3>
<p>Most safety in Alan is tackled at compile-time, where it belongs, so you can write code that handles it and it doesn't cause an issue in production. But one major piece that is handled by the runtime for you is memory allocation, access, and deallocation, and Alan does so without GC pauses.</p>
<p>Languages that handle memory management for you, like Java or Python, tend to be more productive languages to work in, with the cost of a Garbage Collector periodically pausing your code to find and clean up unused memory. Languages without that, like C or C++, require extra cognitive overhead to manage it, but tend to be faster and have a lower memory footprint.</p>
<p>In Alan, memory is allocated at the beginning of an event handler's run for all "stack-like" variables (basic constants and variables in the handler and all functions it uses) while "heap-like" variables (arrays and user types) are allocated as needed to the size needed at runtime over the course of the event handler's run. This memory is "owned" by the handler so the event handler is the memory's "lifetime" and after the event handler has finished executing all memory associated with that handler is finally freed in a way that does not affect any other event handlers running on other threads (only if the CPU is truly single-core would there be a noticeable pause).</p>
<p>This "coarse memory ownership model" allows all code written in Alan to not have to worry about memory allocation and deallocation as if it had a Garbage Collector, but without the GC pause issue.</p>
<h3><a href="#type-inferred" id="type-inferred">Type Inferred</a></h3>
<p>Alan's type inference is capable of automatically inferring all function return types and all variable assignment types, only requiring function arguments to be typed. Once <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan/blob/main/rfcs/006%20-%20Automatic%20Argument%20Interfaces%20RFC.md">this RFC</a> is implemented, it will be capable enough that <em>all</em> of the examples above do not need their types explicitly written out. The following would also work:</p>
<pre><code>on http.connection fn (conn) {
  let res = conn.res
  res.body("Hello, World!").status(200).send()
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>someLargeArray
  .filter(fn (val) = val &gt; someDefaultVal)
  .map(fn (val) = val.innerNumber * 3.14159)
  .reduce(fn (acc, cur) = acc + cur)
  .print()
</code></pre>
<pre><code>const data = http.get("https://someurl.com/csvfile.csv")
const datacsv = (data || '').split('\n').map(fn (row) = row.split(',').map(toInt64))
const data2 = http.get("https://someotherdatasource.org/othercsvfile.csv")
const data2csv = (data2 || '').split('\n').map(fn (row) = row.split(',').map(toInt64))
// Compare the data...
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to be as concise or as explicit as you need to be, with very dynamic-looking code in a static language possible.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-alan-removes" id="what-alan-removes">What Alan Removes</a></h2>
<p>Any engineering endeavour is a balance of trade-offs, and some things must be removed to make room for all of the advantages laid out above.</p>
<p>Most languages tend to make a similar set of trade-offs, with the largest "axis" of trade-offs being on how static or …</p></main></div></div></div></div>

    <p>All networking applications essentially boil down to stringing together
multiple asynchronous calls in the <em>right</em> way.
Traditionally for programs written in C this would be done through
registering callbacks where the callee either handles the event itself
or dispatches through a state machine.
In such implementations however reasoning about memory safety
can be treacherous, with it sometimes requiring full-program knowledge.
Futures, or promises, as they are also referred to,
ease in that regard by allowing asynchronous programs
to be written in direct style, keeping the control flow linear.</p>

<p>All things considered, I do think that futures can be a good fit
for C programming under the right circumstances.
I also hope this article can serve to help one understand Rust futures,
by being a separate reference that only touches the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The Rust futures story is especially interesting because it is
fundamentally different from the usual workings of futures
in functional languages or, say, JavaScript.
Whereas other implementations are <em>push</em>-based -
meaning you give a function to be pushed to with
the resolved result of the future -
Rust futures are <em>poll</em>-based.
Let us see how this looks in C with the simplification
that we limit ourselves to a single task,
i.e. one top-level future running on one thread.
This is common in embedded programming, and still <em>fairly</em> manageable
without the security guarantees given by Rust.
<a href="https://libuv.org/">libuv</a> is used for the event loop.
No heap allocations will be required - it is all downhill from here
(Get it? Because the stack grows down.) -
other than those imposed by the libuv interface.</p>

<p>The main <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>std::future::Future</code></a> trait
translated into C as a virtual method table becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>{</span> <span>POLL_PENDING</span><span>,</span> <span>POLL_READY</span> <span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>poll</span><span>)(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// For now let's skip this method</span>
	<span>// void (*drop)(struct Future *self, struct Context *ctx);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As an example, let us consider the simplest case:
A future that immediately resolves with the number <code>4</code>,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>self</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>future</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>simpleFuture</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>future</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>poll</span> <span>=</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>,</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// ... and in the event loop</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>simpleFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; POLL_READY</span>
<span>// Here we can now use the result</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>result</span> <span>// =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To <em>attempt</em> to resolve the future, we poll it;
it returns <code>POLL_READY</code> and as such we are done.
And for futures that instead return <code>POLL_PENDING</code> when polled,
we just make sure to poll them again later -
futures are lazy and do not make progress unless actively told to do so.
No one knows better than the future itself when it should
be polled again - <em>awoken</em> -
so the context given to all futures allows them to awake their own task.
With many parallel tasks the additional complexity would make itself apparent here,
but in our case something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uv_loop_t</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>wakeTask</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span> <span>// Finished!</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will suffice.
Polling the future once at startup will then kick off the machinery.</p>

<p>For a libuv timer future, we would want to write something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>TimerStatus</span> <span>{</span> <span>TIMER_NOT_STARTED</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_WAITING</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_FINISHED</span> <span>};</span>

<p>The timer handle is made to hold a reference to the future in
its user data field,
so that the callback knows which future to toggle the status on.
However this requires the future object to be pinned in memory,
moving it would make the reference dangling.
Rust deals with this unsafety using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">Pin construct</a>,
that wraps a pointer type, <code>P</code>,
and only permits operations that cannot move the pointee
(for cases where it may not always be safe to do so, i.e. <code>P: !Unpin</code>)
and ensures its memory remains valid until it gets dropped,
or helps make manually vetted code <em>nonleaky</em>.
In C there is no such thing;
the closest you will get is with a red paragraph buried in the documentation.
This means treading with care,
allocating storage for the main future once and never copying it, and
only referring to futures with pointers to their static place in memory.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to get by with just one global <code>uv_timer_t</code>
by recognizing that whenever the main future is awoken either:
(I) A timer, necessarily the one with smallest timeout, fired;
or (II) All timers need be dropped and reset, since the futures form a tree,
as we will see.</p>

<h2 id="after-you">After you</h2>

<p>Running multiple futures sequentially is just a matter of
constructing a new future that polls each future to completion,
one after the other.
The poll method of the outer future will have to return <code>POLL_PENDING</code>
after each intermediate step,
before continuing where it left off - like a coroutine.
Rust turns each future into a state machine,
and doing the same in C means playing the part of the Rust compiler.
An adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a>,
as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">described by Simon Tatham</a>,
can help cut down on the boilerplate.
The idea is that with a <code>switch</code> statement enveloping the whole function-body,
you can yield by creating a unique label using the <code>__LINE__</code> macro
where execution will begin upon reentry,
setting the switch-expression as such, and returning.
The following macros do just that</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>Coroutine</span><span>;</span>

<span>#define COR_START(s) switch (*(s)) { case 0:;
#define COR_YIELD(s, r) do {*(s) = __LINE__; return (r); case __LINE__:;} while(0)
#define COR_END }
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a pointer to the coroutine state.
Great care has to be taken because when returning all locals are invalidated -
if only there was a language that could statically check for such mistakes.
Awaiting then becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#define AWAIT(s, ctx, fut) while ((fut)-&gt;poll((fut), (ctx)) == POLL_PENDING) \
	COR_YIELD((s), POLL_PENDING)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>that is, yielding until the given future is resolved.</p>

<p>To illustrate, here is a future that prints four times to standard output,
first thrice at one second intervals, and then again after two more seconds:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TestFuture</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Note that the local <code>i</code> had to be spilled to the future struct
in order to persist across yield points,
and that unions are used to show what variables are active at each step,
and squeeze out that last driblet of performance even in the face of
uncompromising undefined behaviour threats from all directions.</p>

<h2 id="off-to-the-races">Off to the races</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, multiple futures can be made to run in parallel
using a future combinator whose poll method polls all of its children
and either waits for all to complete - <em>joins</em> them,
or selects the first to become ready.
The latter is a tad more difficult, so let us focus on that.
The reason is that after the first future has resolved,
the rest may still be running, their memory possibly referenced elsewhere.
This is where the <code>drop()</code> method that we have skimmed over comes in.
Dropping a pinned object should relax the constraint
that its memory remains valid.
The drop implementation of <code>TimerFuture</code> above could for example
call <code>uv_timer_stop()</code> so the callback never fires
or overwrite the dangling reference to the future with <code>NULL</code>.
For other types, since their drop implementations are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

One natural use-case is to sync an existing database, such as Postgres or MySQL, to Dolt such that each commit in the Dolt commit graph represents the source database at a particular point in time.

<p>Once data from a production database instance is stored in a Dolt database, the Dolt SQL syntax for traversing the commit graph allows users to use <code>AS OF</code> syntax, as well as programmatic diffs, to understand how their data has changed through time without having to modify the production database. Each commit also acts as a database backup from which the production database can be restored.</p>
<p>In an earlier blogpost we introduced Python based tools for syncing data in <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-27-introducing-sqlsync/">MySQL</a> to Dolt, and later <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-05-26-sqlsync-postgres/">Postgres</a>, to Dolt. However, this still required users to manually recreate the schema from their source database instance, that is MySQL or Postgres, and recreate it in Dolt. We are excited to share new tooling in Doltpy that automates this schema translation.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Before digging into an example, it's worth going over the motivations for doing this. While Doltpy makes this process straightforward, it's definitely more complicated than sharing a connection string with an analyst, data scientist, or anyone that may require access to the production database. We see the motivations as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time travel: the first and most unique benefit is time travel, as illustrated in the diagram above. Dolt stores underlying data in a commit graph, and this commit graph will be updated on every sync, adding a temporal element to the data without altering the production schema. The full set of system tables for examining the commit graph can be found <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/reference/sql/#dolt-system-tables">here</a>.</li>
<li>Experimentation: users can safely experiment with changes to the database that can be robustly examined using Dolt's diffing tools. These changes could be schema, or data, and are particularly useful for developing derived tables. We believe this is partiuclarly valuable for data science teams that might be collaboratively building and managing datasets.</li>
<li>Distribution: Dolt makes distribution to the team easy, each user can simply run <code>dolt clone</code> and immediately be setup with a MySQL server instance containing the production data in a safe data sandbox. Users can then run to <code>dolt pull</code> to capture incremental updates as syncs push data and schema changes to the Dolt database.</li>
<li>Storage: Dolt efficiently computes deltas, so while every commit in the Dolt database represents the upstream database at a point in time, Dolt only stores the differences that appeared between the syncs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, we believe that Dolt presents a compelling way for teams to interact with their production data outside of the core application, and these new features in Doltpy lower the barrier to capturing that value.</p>
<p>We now move on to a concrete example of syncing a Postgres instance's schema and data to Dolt.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Let's suppose that you have a Postgres instance from which you'd like to build a commit graph in the form of a Dolt database. You could even host the database on DoltHub. Dolt efficiently computes diffs between commits, storing only the data that has changed, thus this represents an efficient backup solution from a storage footprint standpoint. For simplicity we assume we have a single table named <code>my_important_table</code>, and we'd like to give it the same name in Dolt:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>etl<span>.</span>sql_sync <span>import</span> sync_schema_to_dolt<span>,</span> POSTGRES_TO_DOLT_TYPE_MAPPINGS
<span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>core <span>import</span> Dolt
<span>import</span> sqlalchemy <span>as</span> sa

dolt <span>=</span> Dolt<span>.</span>init<span>(</span><span>'path/to/dolt/db'</span><span>)</span>
dolt<span>.</span>sql_server<span>(</span><span>)</span>
postgres_engine <span>=</span> sa<span>.</span>create_engine<span>(</span>
    <span>'{dialect}://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>
        dialect<span>=</span><span>'postgresql'</span><span>,</span>
        user<span>=</span>postgres_user<span>,</span>
        password<span>=</span>postgres_password<span>,</span>
        host<span>=</span>postgres_host<span>,</span>
        port<span>=</span>postgres_port<span>,</span>
        database<span>=</span>postgres_database
    <span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
table_map <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'my_important_table'</span><span>:</span> <span>'my_important_table'</span><span>}</span>
sync_schema_to_dolt<span>(</span>postgres_engine<span>,</span> dolt<span>,</span> table_map<span>,</span> POSTGRES_TO_DOLT_TYPE_MAPPINGS<span>)</span>
dolt<span>.</span>add<span>(</span><span>'my_important_table'</span><span>)</span>
dolt<span>.</span>commit<span>(</span><span>'Schema sync successful'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This script will take your Postgres schema, map the types where appropriate using the SQL Alchemy abstraction and implementation specific packages, and then create the table on Dolt database server that we started using <code>dolt.sql_server()</code>. Let's use the existing tools to sync the data, reusing <code>dolt</code> to represent the Dolt database, and <code>postgres_engine</code> to tell <code>doltpy</code> how to use SQL Alchemy to interact with Postgres:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>etl<span>.</span>sql_sync <span>import</span> sync_from_dolt<span>,</span> get_postgres_target_writer<span>,</span> get_dolt_source_reader

sync_from_dolt<span>(</span>get_dolt_source_reader<span>(</span>dolt<span>,</span> get_dolt_table_reader<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
               get_postgres_target_writer<span>(</span>postgres_engine<span>)</span><span>,</span>
               table_map<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That's it! We've now created a repeatable script for transforming snapshotting your Postgres database, or a subset of its tables, into a Dolt database.</p>
<h2>Using SQL Alchemy</h2>
<p>We mentioned <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQL Alchemy</a> in the previous section. In a recent release, we migrated Doltpy to build on top of SQL Alchemy. SQL Alchemy is a "Python SQL toolkit" that provides an elegant SQL abstraction toolkit across SQL implementations. In our initial implementation of data sync, we had used raw SQL to express moving data to and from Dolt and Postgres or MySQL. This led to lots of conditional rendering of raw SQL queries, which was buggy and hard to work with. SQL Alchemy's full featured toolkit for abstracting across databases allowed us to express the necessary schema and data transformation code in Python, and thus avoid conditional manipulation raw SQL. As an example, the only database specific code that had to be added to our Postgres specific code was the following mapping:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> sqlalchemy<span>.</span>dialects <span>import</span> mysql<span>,</span> postgresql

POSTGRES_TO_DOLT_MAPPINGS <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>CIDR<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>VARCHAR<span>(</span><span>43</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>INET<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>VARCHAR<span>(</span><span>43</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>MACADDR<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>VARCHAR<span>(</span><span>43</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>JSON<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>LONGTEXT<span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>JSONB<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>LONGTEXT<span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>ARRAY<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>LONGTEXT<span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>UUID<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>VARCHAR<span>(</span><span>43</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    postgresql<span>.</span>BYTEA<span>:</span> mysql<span>.</span>LONGTEXT
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Mapping a schema is then straight forward, and takes place in pure Python:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>coerce_schema_to_dolt</span><span>(</span>target_table_name<span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span>
                          table<span>:</span> Table<span>,</span>
                          type_mapping<span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> Table<span>:</span>
    target_cols <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
    <span>for</span> col <span>in</span> table<span>.</span>columns<span>:</span>
        target_col <span>=</span> coerce_column_to_dolt<span>(</span>col<span>,</span> type_mapping<span>)</span>
        target_cols<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>target_col<span>)</span>
    
    
    <span>return</span> Table<span>(</span>target_table_name<span>,</span> MetaData<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>target_cols<span>)</span>


<span>def</span> <span>coerce_column_to_dolt</span><span>(</span>column<span>:</span> Column<span>,</span> type_mapping<span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""
    Defines how we map MySQL types to Dolt types, and removes unsupported column level constraints. Eventually this
    function should be trivial since we aim to faithfully support MySQL.
    :param column:
    :param type_mapping:
    :return:
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> Column<span>(</span>column<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
                  type_mapping<span>[</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>column<span>.</span><span>type</span><span>)</span><span>]</span> <span>if</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span>column<span>.</span><span>type</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span> type_mapping <span>else</span> column<span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span>
                  primary_key<span>=</span>column<span>.</span>primary_key<span>,</span>
                  autoincrement<span>=</span>column<span>.</span>autoincrement<span>,</span>
                  nullable<span>=</span>column<span>.</span>nullable<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In summary SQL Alchemy allows us to write generic Python code against an abstraction of underlying database implementations, but then exposes implementation specific details, such as the nuances of various types, and allows us to delegate appropriately.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Doltpy, building on top of Dolt and SQL Alchemy, make it easy to replicate existing databases in a commit graph like structure. The motivation for doing so could be data backups of production databases, or developing richer understanding of point in time data, or simply seeing diffs through time that an existing database does not make available.</p></div></div>]]>

					<div><p>As the weeks pass by, the rumors keep spinning, the likelihood of an Nvidia Arm acquisition increases. On first glance, the two businesses look completely incompatible. A highly vertically integrated graphics and AI company with very high margins buying a low margin IP licensor doesn’t make sense. Nvidia can already build any product they wish as an Arm licensee. Purchasing the whole cow doesn’t yield additional milk or synergies from the current business model. Furthermore, given Nvidia’s reputation as a partner, it would likely even cause customers to start looking for contingencies and accelerate RISC-V adoption. Jensen Huang, in his quest for data center dominance, may destroy the Arm ecosystem for everyone else.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1.jpg?resize=1140%2C606&amp;ssl=1" alt="1" width="1140" height="606" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The rational for purchasing Arm seems ridiculous to many, but Jensen’s vision is for the datacenter being a computer and Nvidia being the one to build it. They need to be to be completely vertically integrated and control every aspect of this computer. Currently they have the accelerator market on lock-down with their impressive hardware and vast software moat of CUDA/various SDKs which was built by thousands of Nvidia engineers over the last decade. With the acquisition of Mellanox, they bring the “Data Processing Unit (DPU)” of the data center in house as well. They have also continued to expand their vertically integrated software stack to networking with acquisitions of SwiftStack and Cumulus Networks.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.jpg?resize=1140%2C575&amp;ssl=1" alt="2" width="1140" height="575" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The datacenter is a 3 legged stool, and the remaining missing piece is a CPU. AMD, Intel, and various hyperscalers are also working to build out their own 3-legged stool. The largest threat to Nvidia is Intel/AMD finally having competent GPUs and software stacks to accompany them. With the US Department of Energy dumping money into SYCL and many in the industry congregating around it, the software front is accelerating rapidly. Furthermore, various hyperscalers are rapidly building out their own CPUs with Arm Neoverse IP to hook in with their accelerators such as the Google TPU and Amazon Inferentia for AI workloads. Lastly, these hyperscalers also already have their own custom network stacks. Nvidia is currently in very strong position, but it is very precarious as their moats may all be eroded simultaneously.</p><p>In any business, in order to maintain a high margin over a long period of time, one must create barriers of entry so high, that no one can break in and disrupt. Even though Intel has stopped executing for essentially 5 years, they are still raking in the dough with &gt;55% gross margins. Jensen Huang’s vision, if fully realized, would see Nvidia building a nearly impenetrable moat that commands high margins and locks customers in. This may sound nefarious, but Nvidia’s solution will be plug and play. The vast majority of companies do not have the resources required to build out the entire software stack to match specialized hardware. Nvidia would offer the best solution, which would eventually become an expensive deal imprisoning you in the Devil’s ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.png?resize=1140%2C587&amp;ssl=1" alt="3" width="1140" height="587" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>This is where acquiring Arm rather than licensing her technology comes into play. Nvidia needs to build the moat, and the only way to do this is to effectively hijack the entire open Arm ecosystem. Developing your own CPU ISA is far too large of an investment and there would be no adoption. Even the opening up of Power and MIPS have failed to stop their slow declines to irrelevancy. RISC-V is also still in its infancy and will take many years to move into any verticals besides embedded.</p><p>Jensen can only realize the of the vision of data center dominance by becoming the only company with the trifecta of CPU, GPU, and DPU. Nvidia can only achieve this by acquiring Arm at an unreasonable price. An independent Arm is simply not worth the $35B-$50B which SoftBank wants. Even a $20B valuation would be high valuation for Arm.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.jpg?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="4" width="1140" height="641" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Nvidia can justify this price if they are willing to flip the semiconductor IP world on its head. The ultimate path to ROI means upending the current Arm business model. Given Nvidia’s over $300B valuation, the deal wouldn’t have to be very dilutive to current shareholders. They would start by purchasing the business in a cash/stock deal and obtaining regulatory approval. Regulatory approval initially seems like a large hurdle, but we believe it will not be. The UK will gladly approve if Nvidia makes commitments for large investments. China would be willing to look the other way if the current Arm China JV drama is swept under the rug. The EU would likely need concessions, but because Nvidia does not compete in most of Arm’s verticals, it shouldn’t be too difficult to obtain approval here either. The US regulators would be foaming at the thought of US control of Arm.</p><p>The next step would involve assuring the clients that the businesses would operate separately. Jensen has already begun telegraphing this according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4649576-9541-4857-b3a4-5b4ccb847642">Financial Times</a>.</p><blockquote><p>As the company extends its reach to supply a complete data centre computing platform, it would sell parts of the technology as separate “layers”, Mr Huang said. Other companies would also be able to license its intellectual property for use in their own chips, rather than needing to buy silicon from Nvidia, he added.</p></blockquote><p>As part of the integration of the two companies, Nvidia would cut or sell the Arm Mali GPU and Ethos NPU business. These would be redundant and can be supplemented with Nvidia’s own expertise. This would be quite the shock as Nvidia’s previous attempts to license their GPU architecture have completely failed. If Nvidia is successful in the renewed licensing efforts, we could live in a world where their CUDA architecture with accompanying software stack (read lock-in) is proliferated across phones, embedded, and the upcoming augmented reality segment. There would be some attrition as companies like Samsung have turned to licensing AMD’s RDNA graphics. In general, it would also accelerate the move out of the Arm ecosystem to RISC-V, but this will be a painful and slow move for most.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5.png?resize=1024%2C395&amp;ssl=1" alt="5" width="1024" height="395" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The key for Nvidia here is creating captive, dependant customers by rocking the boat, but not too violently. If the NvidiArm solution is convenient and cheap, most of the ecosystem will not attempt to rush out. Nvidia likely does not increase prices for a while in order to give their licensees an illusion of a happy status quo. Eventually, these price increases will come. The attrition will be the worst in the embedded market where RISC-V is mostly already here and players like <a href="https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/1295500585123188737?s=20">Alibaba</a> and Si-Five have the IP nearly ready to go.</p><p>The mobile SOC market is captive to Arm roadmaps for years to come, and this is one of the sectors Nvidia can start aggressively extracting ROI. Apple has a perpetual license and so they won’t be affected, but Qualcomm, Samsung, and Mediatek would start to sweat bullets as their licensing costs soar and they have no alternatives without their own custom core teams which have been disbanded. Mediatek specifically is highly dependent on not only ARM CPUs, but also GPUs and interconnects for many of their SOCs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6.png?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="6" width="1140" height="641" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Nvidia’s largest avenue for ROI comes the data center. x86 is long overdue for some disruption. Even with AMD innovating rapidly, the world wants more options. Arm server development is being done by multiple hyperscalers and independent fabless vendors. Arm is going to break the x86 monopoly with a combination of licensed Neoverse designs and in-house designs from the likes of Nuvia or Marvell. Once the x86 duopoly is broken, Nvidia can also raise prices rapidly here. &nbsp;The hyperscalers in-house Arm Neoverse designs will still have better TCO than any merchant silicon, but the savings will begin to wane.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7.png?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="7" width="1140" height="641" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Another adjacent market where Nvidia can begin to pressure their competition is automotive. While Intel’s Mobileye currently uses MIPS and is transitioning to x86, Tesla and Qualcomm use Arm Cores. If licensing fees ratchet up here significantly, Nvidia can begin to extract margin out of their competitors’ sales. Ultimately, the CPU isn’t a competitive advantage in automotive, but just the cheapest and most convenient option.</p><p>As the Arm ecosystem matures, it will stop being the cheapest option, but only remain the convenient one. Embedded markets have already seen the light of RISC-V and the adoption can only accelerate from here. Other markets have been hooked to the drug of cheap, licensed, Arm IP. With aggressive Nvidia ownership, the junkies will have no choice but to pay up and give in to demands for the short run. They will search for alternative supplies, but this move will take a long time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.jpg?resize=1140%2C642&amp;ssl=1" alt="8" width="1140" height="642" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Nvidia’s endgame isn’t more revenue from licensing costs. Their endgame is a fully vertically integrated data center provider. They will want to make and control every part of the three legged stool. This means they slowly destroy the idea of Neoverse. Whether through making that IP extremely costly, or having their own in house designs be a generation ahead, Nvidia will build a moat around Arm server CPUs. Over time, Jensen Huang will muscle out other Arm vendors supplementing them with Nvidia’s in-house designs. The open Arm ecosystem will be hijacked, and be replaced with a closed off ecosystem rivaling or exceeding that of Intel and AMD.</p><p><span>If Nvidia can quickly seize the worlds most important IP, the most commonly used CPU ISA and designs, they will control the destiny of mobile and data center. This is Jensen Huang’s “Trojan Horse” for a Machiavellian takeover of the future of computing.</span></p></div>

<p>Let’s open with the controversy: the scripts that live under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> because they are code, <em>not</em> configuration.</p>

<p>This misplacement is something that has bugged me for ages but I never had the energy to open this can of worms back when I was very involved in NetBSD. I suspect it would have been a draining discussion and a very difficult thing to change.</p>

<p>But… what am I talking about anyway?</p>

<p>If you have administered a BSD system, you have certainly encountered the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory; and if you have administered pre-systemd Linux systems, you have dealt with <code>/etc/init.d/</code>. These directories contain startup scripts to configure the system at boot time and are immutable. Their code is parameterized to allow changing their behavior via configuration files, not via code edits. And that’s the base of my critique.</p>

<p>But before getting into why the current state is problematic and how things should look like, let’s first dig into how we got here. And, for that, we need to go back in history.</p>



<p>4.4BSD’s (1993) boot process was rather simple: the kernel started <code>init</code> which in turn ran the <code>/etc/rc</code> script before starting <code>getty</code> on each console. The <code>/etc/rc</code> monolith was in charge of configuring the machine’s file systems and processes, and delegated to two other scripts: <code>/etc/netstart</code> for network configuration and <code>/etc/rc.local</code> for locally-added services. Current BSD systems are more advanced in this area as we shall see later, but the core boot process remains the same: <code>/etc/rc</code> is the primary entry point and bootstraps a collection of shell scripts.</p>

<p>In the early days, package management and file provenance tracking, like we are used to having in popular Linux distributions, was not a thing. You were expected to tune the systems’ behavior by <em>editing</em> files which might or might not have been designed to support edits. If you had to edit <code>/etc/rc</code>, which was a script shipped by the system, that was alright.</p>

<p><code>/etc/rc.local</code>, on the other hard, was <em>not</em> shipped by the system, and it was up to you to create it if you wanted to add custom startup commands without modifying <code>/etc/rc</code>. And this is where things get interesting. <code>/etc/rc.local</code> didn’t need to be supported: if you were expected and able to edit <code>/etc/rc</code> anyway, why would you deal with a separate file? The reason is, most likely, to simplify system upgrades: during an upgrade, you want to benefit from any upstream changes made to <code>/etc/rc</code> (some of which might actually be <em>necessary</em> for proper system operation). Applying updates to a manually-modified file is tricky, so putting as many of your manual overrides into <code>/etc/rc.local</code> helped minimize this problem.</p>



<p>System V 4 (SVR4, 1988) also came with its own, and very different, boot process. The key difference was that System V had the concept of runlevels. As a result, configuring the boot process was a more convoluted endeavour because it was possible to select different services per runlevel.</p>

<p>To accomplish per-runlevel tuning, the system used <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/config-files-vs-directories.html">configuration directories rather than files</a>: there was a separate <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> directory for each runlevel (where <code>X</code> was the number of the runlevel), and these directories contained one file per action to take at startup time. To avoid duplicates, these files were just symlinks to common files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code>—and the symlinks, not their targets, were named so that their lexicographical order determined startup execution order.</p>

<p>Once again, we can already observe issues here: the symlinks under <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> <em>are</em> configuration because their presence indicates what to start and their names determine their startup order. But the files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code> are <em>not</em>: they are shell scripts shipped with the system and should not be manually modified.</p>



<p>NetBSD <a href="http://www.mewburn.net/luke/papers/rc.d.pdf">modernized the boot process</a> in its 1.5 release (2000), and it did so in two ways: first, it introduced <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> as a directory to contain separate scripts per action and service; and, second, it introduced <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcorder+8+NetBSD-9.0-STABLE">the <code>rcorder(8)</code> tool</a> to determine the order in which these services run. <code>rcorder(8)</code> uses dependency information encoded in the scripts as comments—not lexicographical ordering as System V did. FreeBSD <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.1-RELEASE&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html">inherited this design</a> in its 5.0 release (2003) and OpenBSD reimplemented something similar in its 4.9 release (2011).</p>

<p>With these two pieces in place, the <code>/etc/rc</code> script in NetBSD and FreeBSD changed to execute all files from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> based on the output of <code>rcorder(8)</code>. Among these scripts is <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.d/local"><code>/etc/rc.d/local</code></a>, whose purpose is to run <code>/etc/rc.local</code> if it exists. And that’s all, really. The <code>/etc/rc</code> script thus became <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc">trivial</a>.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the scripts shipped in <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are <em>highly configurable</em> via the user-controlled <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.conf"><code>/etc/rc.conf</code></a> file. This essentially makes the scripts read-only, as it shifts local customizations to the configuration file. <em>System administrators are not supposed to edit the scripts.</em> Instead, they are supposed to: modify <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to customize what gets run and how; add new scripts under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> if they so choose; and edit <code>/etc/rc.local</code> to easily run arbitrary commands.</p>



<p>My main gripe is that the files under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are immutable scripts. They do not belong in <code>/etc/</code> and their presence there makes system upgrades harder for no good reason.</p>

<p>You see: in NetBSD and FreeBSD, system upgrades happen by unpacking new distribution sets in the root directory and then running a script to incorporate configuration updates. This script is interactive and helps highlight how new system-provided updates to configuration files conflict with previous manual edits. (This process might seem rudimentary to you, but it’s actually pretty robust and easy to understand—and you can use tooling like <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/sysupgrade/">sysupgrade</a> to make it trivial.)</p>

<p>So why is that a problem? Because you will <em>always</em> face merges like this:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>And, really, who cares? Why are you being distracted to review a <em>code</em> change when what you are trying to do is assess <em>configuration</em> conflicts? How many times have you actually objected to these merges?</p>

<p>You might say: well, I want to know <em>exactly</em> how the boot process of my machine changes during an upgrade. Sure, that’s a fine goal, but then this procedure is flawed and completely insufficient to achieve such goal. In the example above, whatever <code>/etc/rc.d/npf</code> does can also be done from within the <code>/sbin/npfctl</code> binary it invokes… and you were never asked to review changes to the latter during an upgrade, were you? And <em>of course</em> you could review the binary’s code as part of your own system build, but if you did that, then you could have reviewed the startup script as well, right?</p>



<p>Startup scripts provided by the system need to live in a location that can contain executables—but we don’t want those executables to show up in the <code>PATH</code>. These requirements discard <code>bin</code> and <code>sbin</code>, and points us towards <code>libexec</code> on BSD systems and somewhere under <code>lib</code> on Linux.</p>

<p>Therefore, the read-only startup scripts should move from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> (which, by the way, also applies to <code>/etc/rc</code>, <code>/etc/rc.subr</code>, and <code>/etc/rc.shutdown</code>). And that’s it. <del><code>/etc/rc</code></del> <code>/libexec/rc</code> should continue to use <code>rcorder(8)</code> to check what’s needed to run, but it should read files from <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code>. You might even want to support a separate location for user-created services, which might still be <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> or, better yet, a more fitting location like <code>/usr/pkg/libexec/rc.d/</code> (though that quickly runs into problems if you have multiple file systems).</p>

<p>With this design, system upgrades would be much saner because the configuration merge process would focus, purely, on actual configuration changes and not on irrelevant code changes. All updates to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> would be applied by unpacking the new distribution sets (<code>base.txz</code> in this case) without disturbing you about how exactly they changed.</p>

<p>Does this relate to Linux distributions at all? I briefly mentioned <code>/etc/init.d/</code> at the beginning, and the problem there is similar. But it’s also an obsolete problem given that Linux distributions have moved onto systemd by now. That said, systemd still has to manage individual services and, like it or not, has gotten this right. If we look at the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html"><code>systemd.unit(5)</code></a> manual page, which describes where units are loaded from, the system first looks into various <code>/etc/</code> and <code>/run/</code> directories, but then also looks at <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code> (a read-only location correctly controlled by the package manager)—and the vast majority of the scripts live inside the latter.</p>



<p>I currently don’t run BSD systems any more so my incentives to make this happen are low… but if this all makes sense and is something you’d like to pursue, by all means please do! I’m happy to help …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>
I take a lot of vacation.  I find it more enjoyable than working.
</p><p>
That's not to say that I don't like working.  I write software for a living, which is crazy fun in and of itself.  If you'd have told little 14 year old Jason, writing games on his Commodore 64, that he'd one day have a job doing basically the same thing, he'd have been pretty stoked.
</p><p>
But over the years I've found a lot of other stuff that I like doing even more than programming computers.  I like to climb rocks, surf and travel through interesting parts of the world, and always found it hard to do that for, say, most of the year every year when I had to work for other people.  So I set out to build a business with the heuristic of "Maximize Jason's Vacation Time". 
</p><p>
This is a rather long and drawn out account of how I did that (and how you can probably do that too.)
</p><h3>Stage One: Contracting</h3>
<p>
I sat in a lot of felt cubicles in the 90s, riding various venture-backed startups into the ground and generally having a lot of fun doing so.  Over time, I noticed the same story coming up again and again.  About "the Contractors who had charged $150k to build the prototype" and "the Contractors they brought in for $200/hr to build this other system".  The general tone was always sort of "That's unfair.  We could have saved the company a ton of money if we'd have done this ourselves."  But I came away with a different message:
</p><p>
I gotta figure out how to get into this "Contractor" thing.
</p><p>
So, as always happened in 1998, the company I was working for burned through its $5m over the course of a summer and laid everybody off just before hitting the ground.  I had been doing some cool stuff for these guys, so I got a call from the CTO asking if I was interested in sticking around for a few months to mothball the tech so the investors could possibly sell it onward.  
</p><p>
"I suppose", I said, "I could stick around on a Contract..."
</p><h3>Stage Two: Travelling Between Contracts</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/oz-hooptie.jpg">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/oz-hooptie.jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>
Now the cool thing about Contracting, in case it wasn't clear above, is that they pay you at least twice as much as everybody else to do the same job.  Yeah, you have to buy your own health insurance, and they can drop you with no notice whatsoever.  But it turns out that <i>any</i> job can and will drop you without notice.  And catastrophic health coverage is like $100/month for a healthy guy under 40.  The math kinda works out.
</p><p>
Being an Engineer, and thus knowing how to divide, I quickly worked out that a job paying "twice as much in a year" will also pay you "exactly as much in six months".  And hey what do you know, they have Contracts that last just 6 months.  And flights to Thailand for $800.
</p><p>
So I started taking time off between gigs.
</p><p>
I experimented a bit and found that if I moved to a high cost-of-living spot like Southern California to pick up those contract gigs, I could live cheaply and sock away even more of the higher rate those gigs would pay.  After all, while rooms in LA go for $900/month instead of $300/month in Portland, you can make up that difference with a single day's pay at $75/hr.
</p><p>
And since rooms on the beach in Thailand were going for $5/day back then, it'd only take a few months of Contracting to pay for an entire year on the road in places like Southeast Asia and Africa, including occasional flights and beer money.  I got pretty good at rock climbing.
</p><p>
As it worked out, though, I never made it a whole year on the road.  I missed thinking. As fun and rewarding as it is to travel the world, the intellectual challenges you face trying to work out bus routes in a language you don't understand can never compare to the ones you face writing code.  I'd end up emailing my contacts back home somewhere around the 6-9 month mark, and would eventually hop a flight back to LA to work another gig.
</p><h3>Stage Three: Travelling While Contracting</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/dream-valley-office.jpg">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/dream-valley-office.jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>That was all way back in the early 00's.  Even then it was apparent that this whole Internet thing was kinda taking off.  While the concept of "guy on a beach with a laptop" was still mostly just a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kfIFDX9kE4&amp;list=PLFjuhgb3UjqZFZQ6SwcBE98_qNSKyF1AV">cheesy AT&amp;T ad</a>, it was starting to seem like it might not actually be that far off.  I had some freelance clients in other cities.  Some of them I'd never met in person.  I was already working remotely.  Why not see how remote I could go?
</p><p>
So I picked a client.  Or rather, a client picked himself by dragging out a project when he knew I had already booked a flight.  And we tried having me build his thing out of my bungalow on Tonsai beach.
</p><p>
It kinda worked.  And it got my internal mathematician working again to determine that hey, I can afford to live here on this beach indefinitely if I can somehow arrange just one day of work per month.
</p><p>
That's good.
</p><h3>Stage Four: Software Product Business</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/arusi-laptop-2.jpg">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/arusi-laptop-2.jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>The only downside of all this is that it still required quite a bit of working for Other People.  Other People often have silly ideas about what needs working on, and the work is sometimes not as much fun as you could hope.  But try as I might, I couldn't find a solution.  The problem was, every time I stopped working for Other People, they stopped sending me money.  Something had to give.
</p><p>
I started working on building a Software Product in my spare time (which, helpfully, I still had a lot of).  But boy, did I suck at it.  There are a lot of really good resources online these days to steer a fella clear of all the obvious pitfalls I stumbled across in places like picking product ideas, gauging interest, finding customers, etc.,  So now I do a lot of nodding along to articles with tons of common sense advice that anybody with half a brain could have figured out, but that had never occurred to me when I designed and built my first several products.
</p><p>
But I stuck with it and eventually came up with <a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">Twiddla</a> (which lots of people really like) and <a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">S3stat</a> (which people are actually willing to pay for).  The second one pays to keep the first alive, which is handy because that one is a lot more impressive to show off in case I ever need to find another one o' those contract gigs in the future.
</p><p>
And the cool thing with Software as a Service (SaaS) products is that people keep sending you money every month whether you're working or not.  QED.
</p><p>
It's still hard though.  When you first build one of these "earn money in your sleep" SaaS products, it really doesn't make you all that much money. After a few months of being launched and signing customers, S3stat was still only bringing in something like $50/month.
</p><p>
It was tough to keep motivated to tweak, market, A/B Test and otherwise keep moving forward with this product stuff, especially looking at the old consulting rate and comparing it to the effective hourly rate from this f'ng side project.
</p><p>
But here's the thing.  After a while, that $50/month started to look more like $500.  Still nothing compared to consulting, but it paid me that $500 while I was off surfing in Morocco for the whole month.  And the next year it paid me $1,000/month while I was backpacking through South America and building another (sadly failed) product on the laptop.  It even kept sending me money at the same time I was doing consulting gigs for other companies.
</p><p>
Notice that it kept growing even when neglected.  That's another advantage of SaaS.  Until attrition really kicks in, you're going to be signing more customers than you lose.  Even if you only sign a few per month, that's revenue that just keeps piling on top of itself.
</p><h3>Stage Five: Chillin'</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/boat-2.jpg">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/img.expatsoftware.com/blog/boat-2.jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>
Having a successful Single Player Software Empire does have one downside: Customers.
</p><p>
Having Customers can sometimes seem an awful lot like working for Other People.  Customers often have silly ideas about what features your product needs.  They send you emails asking to reset their password, and they don't appreciate it if your thing stops working for an entire week while you're taking a riverboat up the Amazon.
</p><p>
I'm lucky that S3stat has a pretty technical audience that doesn't generally need a lot of hand holding, so support was never something that needed my full time attention.  Still, I'm an Engineer, so I like to automate everything that can be automated.  That doesn't just include simple things like those password reset emails.  It also means that whenever I get a support request, I make sure to Fix It Twice:  Once to fix the issue for the customer, and another time in the code, documentation or UI to make sure that I don't ever see another support request for it.  So as time goes on, there are fewer things that can interrupt my Days Off.  (Days Off being defined as days where the sun is out or the kids are off school and I don't need a rest day from climbing or surfing, so hey, let's polish the product a bit).
</p><p>
Naturally, I still get bored of Chillin' The Most, so it's handy to still be good at all this computer programming stuff.  I'm still cranking out new features for <a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">S3stat</a> and <a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">Twiddla</a>, and I have <a href="https://www.unwaffle.com/">Unwaffle</a> (the <a href="https://www.unwaffle.com/">SaaS Customer Lifecycle Metrics</a> thing I've been writing about lately) running in beta mode for a few test customers.  Lots of code is getting written, but finally it's all happening on my time.
</p><p>
Which Was What We Wanted. 
</p><h3>A footnote.</h3>

<p>
I see articles like this come past on the Internet every once in awhile, and they are invariably received with hostility.  "Sampling Bias!"  "That guy could only do this because of $X!"  "That wouldn't work today in this economy!" "If all this stuff really worked, why tell us about it instead of milking it for millions. He's probably just trying to sell us his book!"  Lots of reasons why we should quickly dismiss everything that was said above and carry on the way we were before.
</p><p>
But a good plan instead might be to read those stories and see if there is an idea or two in there that might be applicable to other people.  Perhaps, even, to you yourself.

Personally, I don't find any of the above to be particularly …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert requested resources for learning about fuzzing
programming language implementations on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d like to learn about fuzzing, specifically fuzzing programming language
implementations. Do you have reading materials you would recommend, blog
posts, papers, books or even recorded talks?</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/Love2Code">@Love2Code</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/Love2Code/status/1290363848885776385">August 3,
2020</a></cite></p>

<p>Maxime received many replies linking to informative papers, blog posts, and
lectures. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1290368969199636480">John Regehr suggested writing a simple generative fuzzer for the
programming
language.</a></p>

<p>A generative fuzzer combines a test case generator with the system under test
(e.g. your compiler), generating new test cases and feeding them into the
system:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>generative_fuzzer</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Use the test case generator to create a new</span>
        <span>// input.</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>input</span> <span>=</span> <span>generate_test_case</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Feed that input into the system under test.</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>run_system_under_test</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>);</span>

        <span>// Finally, if the system under test crashed,</span>
        <span>// failed an assertion, etc... then report</span>
        <span>// that!</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>result</span><span>.is_interesting</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>report</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I realized that many people might not know what it takes to write their own
generative fuzzer, so this blog post shows one aspect of it: implementing a test
case generator.</p>

<p>Our test case generator will generate <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> programs. While
WebAssembly has its own quirks — it’s a binary format and is generally a
compilation target rather than a source language — it is a small and
simple language. The techniques we use when generating WebAssembly should
transfer to generating the programming language of your choice.</p>

<p>If you want to skip the exposition and jump head first into the code, <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/wasm-smith">here is
the repository for our final test case generator</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-test-case-generator">What is a Test Case Generator?</h2>

<p>Test case generators generate test cases. These test cases are always within the
test domain: no cycles are wasted on invalid inputs, such as source text that
fails to parse. Compare this to <a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/beta/html/MutationFuzzer.html">mutation-based fuzzing</a>, where existing seed
inputs are mutated to produce new inputs. In general, nothing guarantees that
the new, mutated input is still within the test domain: the mutation may have
introduced a syntax error. This property, that generated inputs are always
within the test domain, is generative fuzzing’s main advantage and the test case
generator’s main responsibility.</p>

<p>A test case generator should, additionally, support every feature of its target
programming language. You won’t discover a bug in your compiler’s handling of
<code>switch</code> statements if the test case generator doesn’t support generating
<code>switch</code> statements. Pushing this idea even further, the test case generator
should <em>uniformly sample</em> from the test domain. If the test case generator can
technically generate <code>switch</code> statements but the probability of doing so is
nearly zero, then you likely still won’t find that bug. However, uniformly
sampling from the infinite set of all programs that can be written in a
particular programming language is
<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1700">nontrivial</a> and an area of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0992v1.pdf">active</a>
<a href="https://havrikov.github.io/publications/ase19-preprint.pdf">research</a>.</p>

<p>A test case generator should, finally, be fast. The faster we can generate test
cases, the faster we will discover bugs. If the generator is too slow, we can
blow our time budget, failing to find those bugs at all.</p>

<h2 id="getting-set-up">Getting Set Up</h2>

<p>First, we create a new crate with <code>cargo</code>. We’ll name this crate <code>wasm-smith</code>,
giving a little nod to <a href="https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/">Csmith</a>, the popular C program generator.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>cargo new <span>--lib</span> wasm-smith</code></pre></figure>

<p>Second, we add <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/arbitrary">the <code>arbitrary</code> crate</a> as a dependency:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span># wasm-smith/Cargo.toml</span>

<span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>arbitrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4.6"</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span> <span>=</span> <span>["derive"]</span> <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>arbitrary</code> crate helps us generate structured data from arbitrary bytes. It
is typically used in combination with <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a> to translate the raw bytes
given to use by libFuzzer into something that the system you’re testing can
process. For example, a color conversion library might use <code>arbitrary</code> to turn
the raw fuzzer-provided bytes into <code>Rgb</code> or <code>Hsl</code> color types. We will use it in
a similar way for this project, translating raw bytes given to us by libFuzzer
into semantically valid WebAssembly modules.</p>

<p>The <code>arbitrary</code> crate’s main export is <a href="https://docs.rs/arbitrary/0.4.5/arbitrary/trait.Arbitrary.html">the <code>Arbitrary</code> trait</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Arbitrary</span><span>:</span> <span>Sized</span> <span>+</span> <span>'static</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>arbitrary</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Unstructured</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Provided methods hidden...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It takes an <a href="https://docs.rs/arbitrary/0.4.5/arbitrary/struct.Unstructured.html"><code>Unstructured</code></a>, which is a helpful wrapper around a byte slice, and
returns an instance of the type for which it is implemented.</p>

<p>For our <code>wasm-smith</code> crate, we define a <code>Module</code> type that represents our
pseudo-random WebAssembly modules, and then we implement the <code>Arbitrary</code> trait
for it:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> <span>arbitrary</span><span>::{</span><span>Arbitrary</span><span>,</span> <span>Result</span><span>,</span> <span>Unstructured</span><span>};</span>

<span>/// A pseudo-random WebAssembly module.</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Arbitrary</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>arbitrary</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Unstructured</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>todo!</span><span>()</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Before we fill in that <code>todo!()</code> lets take a moment to settle on a design for
what the implementation will look like.</p>

<h2 id="translating-grammars-into-generators">Translating Grammars into Generators</h2>

<p>Writing a generator is remarkably similar to hand-writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent
parser</a>, so if you’ve done that before, then you should feel right at home. For
example, given this grammar production (borrowed and lightly edited from <a href="https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling">the
C++ name mangling</a> grammar):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;class-enum-type&gt; ::= Ts &lt;name&gt;
                    | Tu &lt;name&gt;
                    | Te &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A recursive descent parser will, almost mechanically, translate the production
into something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> <span>Parse</span> <span>for</span> <span>ClassEnumType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Parser</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Ts &lt;name&gt;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>p</span><span>.peek</span><span>(</span><span>"Ts"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>p</span><span>.consume</span><span>(</span><span>"Ts"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Name</span><span>::</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>ClassEnumType</span><span>::</span><span>Ts</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>));</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// Tu &lt;name&gt;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>p</span><span>.peek</span><span>(</span><span>"Tu"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>p</span><span>.consume</span><span>(</span><span>"Tu"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Name</span><span>::</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>ClassEnumType</span><span>::</span><span>Tu</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>));</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// Te &lt;name&gt;</span>
        <span>p</span><span>.consume</span><span>(</span><span>"Te"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Name</span><span>::</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>ClassEnumType</span><span>::</span><span>Te</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Our generator will do something similar, except instead of peeking at the input
string to decide which right-hand side of the production to parse, we will make
a pseudo-random choice to generate one of those potential right hand sides.</p>

<p>We could use a random number generator directly to make these choices, but this
has two problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We give up determinism unless we are careful to control the RNG’s seed and
reuse the same RNG everywhere, threading it through all of our functions as a
parameter. Determinism is extremely important for reproducing test failures!
It’s definitely possible to do these things, but can occasionally be a little
annoying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, using an RNG precludes a mature fuzzing engine, like
libFuzzer, from guiding our test case generation based on code coverage and
other insights.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, we use a raw input byte slice given to us by libFuzzer or AFL as a
sequence of predetermined choices.<sup id="back-dont-require-libfuzzer"><a href="#foot-dont-require-libfuzzer">0</a></sup> This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00078v1.pdf">lets the fuzzer guide our
test case generation</a>, and <a href="https://drmaciver.github.io/papers/reduction-via-generation-preview.pdf">gives us test case reduction “for
free”</a> since we can ask the fuzzer to reduce the raw input
sequence, rather than write a domain-specific test case reducer. This comes as a
relief because writing a reducer that understands WebAssembly is easily as much
effort as writing the generator itself.</p>

<p>Here is the same C++ mangling example from above, but translated from a parser
into a generator, using <code>Unstructured</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>arbitrary_class_enum_type</span><span>(</span>
    <span>u</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Unstructured</span><span>,</span>
    <span>output</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>u</span><span>.int_in_range</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..=</span><span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Ts &lt;name&gt;</span>
        <span>0</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>output</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>"Ts"</span><span>);</span>
            <span>arbitrary_name</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>output</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>// Tu &lt;name&gt;</span>
        <span>1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>output</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>"Tu"</span><span>);</span>
            <span>arbitrary_name</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>output</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>// Te &lt;name&gt;</span>
        <span>2</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>output</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>"Te"</span><span>);</span>
            <span>arbitrary_name</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>output</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>unreachable!</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Once again, this is mostly mechanical.</p>

<p>This pattern will generate <em>syntactically</em> correct test cases that can be parsed
successfully but which likely contain a plethora of type errors, calls to
undefined functions, etc. We’ve set out to generate <em>semantically</em> correct test
cases that pass type checking and will exercise more than just the language
implementation’s frontend.</p>

<p>Our final pattern maintains some extra information about the program we’ve
generated thus far, so that we can consult that information when generating new
forms. This extra information might include which names are in scope, the types
of each variable, etc. We consult that information while dynamically building up
thunks for every valid option we could generate. Once we have enumerated every
option, we ask the <code>Unstructured</code> to choose one of them, and finally we call the
chosen thunk to generate the form.</p>

<p>Here is an example of using this pattern for generating integer expressions,
where an integer expression is either a constant integer, an arithmetic
operation, a use of an integer variable, or a call of a function that returns an
integer:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>arbitrary_int_expr</span><span>(</span>
    <span>u</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Unstructured</span><span>,</span>
    <span>scope</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Scope</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// We will dynamically build up all of the valid</span>
    <span>// options of what we can generate.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>options</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>fn</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Unstructured</span><span>,</span>
        <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Scope</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[];</span>

    <span>// It is always valid to generate a constant.</span>
    <span>options</span><span>.push</span><span>(|</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>.arbitrary</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>))</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>// It is always valid to generate an addition.</span>
    <span>options</span><span>.push</span><span>(|</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>lhs</span> <span>=</span> <span>arbitrary_int_expr</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> …</code></pre></figure></div></article></div></div></div>

Read their fresh views on leadership, managing through change, and the ins and outs of modern work. Think of it as your office hours with some of the most innovative people in business.</p><p>We continue this series on resilience with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roybahat/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Roy Bahat</a>. Roy is the head of Bloomberg Beta, a venture fund backed by Bloomberg L.P. that invests in companies that make business work better. Roy has been an entrepreneur (started a venture-backed video game console), a public company executive (at News Corporation), a board member for companies and nonprofits, and in government (in his hometown of New York). When he’s not teaching media at U.C. Berkeley’s Haas School of Business or investing in the future of work, he’s also not sharing advice on <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat" rel="noopener" target="_self">Twitter</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Thanks for joining us for 12 Questions, Roy. Can you describe your career in twelve words or less</strong></p><p>A determined random walk that only became clear in retrospect.<br></p><p><strong>That's very meta. Do you want to expand on that mental image?</strong></p><p>Sure. I was always jealous of the people who knew what they wanted to do. I had to work in a bunch of settings to figure out where my home was: from nonprofit, academia, and government to professional services, startups, and big corporations. And I think my "home" is in supporting people who are building new organizations. At the moment, that's venture-backed startups.<br></p><p><strong>Let's dive into a topic that is top of mind for most people, given the state of the world right now. What does resilience mean to you?</strong></p><p>I think we often treat resilience as an innate characteristic of people. But I believe that it's a skill that we use to recover from hardship through repeated attempts and self-management to keep ourselves going.<br></p><p><strong>So, how has your thinking about resilience changed in 2020?</strong></p><p>I've come to a realization this year that in the startup world, we love the myth of the heroic individual—and resilience is a part of that myth. It's something I've thought about a lot, but the current situation has confirmed it for me. While I believe in an individual creators' power, we often take the focus off the system that enables them to be resilient. And it takes the focus off the differences that make one person's resilience easier to practice than another.</p><p>There are many psychological reasons why that happens, including the fact that all successful people had to overcome some hardship. But that doesn't make their hardship equivalent to somebody else's. So in the aftermath of the protest surrounding George Floyd's murder and the changed circumstances with the pandemic, it reminded me that resilience is something that stems from having the opportunity to show you can be resilient.</p><p><strong>Resilience as a proxy for opportunity. Curious: when was the last time you checked-in with yourself?</strong></p><p>This morning. I try to have a scientist's attitude about it, which is to say hypotheses that you falsify.</p><p>If you're confident you're going in the right direction regardless of what the evidence says, you're probably not paying attention to the world. So I ask myself a lot, "how do I know if I'd be wrong?" And one of the places <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roybahat/detail/recent-activity/posts/" rel="noopener" target="_self">I've written about that is on LinkedIn</a>. I try to write an <a href="https://also.roybahat.com/your-career-is-a-mess-a8a58acd18fa" rel="noopener" target="_self">honest accounting</a> of what I was thinking and what was right or wrong about different choices. Unless I can learn from them, I don't know where I'm going.</p><p><strong>Is there a time when you wish you were more resilient?</strong></p><p>It might just be because of this present moment, but I think I'm one of these people who tries to think of myself as a good person and do the right thing. And so I can be fragile when critiqued around bias, whether that's sexism or racism because it doesn't align with how I think about what I try to do. And so, I wish that I could've been more resilient in not dismissing that the first few times it came up in my life and try to learn from it.</p><p><strong>Related, what's one big mistake you made, and how did you bounce back from that?</strong></p><p>I should have proposed to my wife years before I did.</p><p>I used to think relationships should all be easy. I was mistaken. Any relationship worth having is one you should take seriously and keep working on it. I wrote a <a href="https://also.roybahat.com/what-our-kids-see-7dc650be8a90" rel="noopener" target="_self">blog post</a> a few years ago now about my son asking me to get off my phone. It stung. But my relationship with my son matters more to me than my ego, and when something I do hurts him, I want to pay attention and grow from it.<br></p><p><strong>In your view, how can people be more resilient in their work-life?</strong></p><p>We should think of resilience as a skill or a muscle. You see something you want to achieve and the obstacle to it and then get resourceful. I think the mistake is being in a situation where you weren't resilient, which leads to some inherent judgment about you as a person versus "you know I didn't hit that basket, I've got to try again."<br></p><p><strong>How does being vulnerable help in building a resilient team?</strong></p><p>The more I see the humanity in the people with whom I am working, the better I can work with them. I know where they're coming from, and I have empathy for them because of that. Somewhat connected to the hero myth—being resilient and being cold is not the same thing.</p><p><strong>Who is the most resilient person that you know, and why?</strong></p><p>Honestly, there are probably many I don't realize are resilient because they keep their struggles private. <a href="https://adeolonoh.com/page/2/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Ade Olonoh</a> wrote a recent <a href="https://www.formstack.com/blog/2020/why-we-should-talk-about-race-ade-olonoh/" rel="noopener" target="_self">piece about race issues</a> and how he struggled to talk about it. I've known the guy for years, and I didn't realize this was something he was going through. So, that makes me think about all the other people who are there who have a sort of silent resilience.</p><p>In terms of people I know, I'd say my wife. She had a much more difficult upbringing that I did economically, and the fact that she's the amazing person that she is, I think, is a sign of resilience. And my mom. My dad passed away when I was 12, and my mom persevered. My brother and I were never worried about things falling apart because she handled it. But again, are they the most resilient people I know? Maybe not. They're the people I know the most about their resilience.</p><p><strong>If you could give people one piece of advice about what's going on in the world right now, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Well, first, I have to say that I'm allergic to the idea of giving advice.</p><p>Someone once told me that all advice is autobiographical. Whether it's one person trying to get you to justify what they do to feel better about themselves or, worse, they're trying to live vicariously through you as an experiment for themselves. Either way, it's not in your interest. I do this <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thisisnotadvice&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live" rel="noopener" target="_self">daily series of tips about work on Twitter</a>, where I go deeper into this concept.</p><p>From my experience, I would say to look at what's happening in the world as a project. And not like a side project. You have to put it front and center for yourself and amp up your experimentation on what's working for you. If that means limiting the amount of news you consume to a few hours a day or eating healthier, taking a long bath, calling someone you love every day, fighting for social justice, etc. Treat yourself as the subject of your experiments. I made a list of 14 things that might work to help myself get through this time, and I think I had to do 12 of the 14 before I felt much better. And now I'm in a much clearer place, but it's still a work in progress.<br></p><p><strong>What are some books or resources you'd recommend on resilience, or that help with getting through tough times?</strong></p><p>Read more fiction. I think we tend to read these abstract advice books about grit and related topics, but for me, what keeps me going are the stories I experience in my own life and the stories I read. Of course, you should listen to the Brene Brown TED talk on vulnerability and shame—it's really good. But I would read stories written by authors who had to go through tough times to get to where they are.</p><p>The new one I've started is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nk-jemisin-city-became-book-coronavirus-11597764521" rel="noopener" target="_self">N. K. Jeminsin</a>, because I've never read any of her stuff before, and I've gotten a lot out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Irving" rel="noopener" target="_self">John Irving's books</a>—A Prayer for Owen Meany is one of my favorite novels. The sustenance for progress is examples, and we get those examples from a specific technology: stories.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/96577fbf0ed9b0619149cc5f5d8dc663554a299d-2316x2316.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Roy Bahat and family"></a></p><hr></div></div></section></div>]]>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people. If the drug doesn’t work in people, there is no iterating. If you want to modify the product, you need to restart the entire process over again. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_633705"><div><h2><strong>Founders &amp; Market</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around a market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around key biology</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_651094"><div><p>In tech, a prototypical founder often worked at the incumbent company or realized a market opportunity by being that market themself. The insight around the market opportunity itself is a core value of the company. </p><p>In biotech, the insight of the founder is around a new or better way to develop a drug for the disease, or a discovery that was made in the laboratory (and the relevant patents around it). </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_665620"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often younger, ‘youth wunderkinds’ widely accepted <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often older due to scientific training or are a professional CEO, rarer to have very young founders </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_678110"><div><p>In tech, the 18-year-old drop-out is lauded and mystified. If anything, older founders may be subconsciously discriminated against in favor for younger founders. </p><p>In biotech, the prototypical founder is older, often a career CEO or exec coming out of a Big Pharma company. At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing. Once a new market is validated, other companies/copycats/fast-followers flow in. </p><p>In biotech, the market opportunities are diseases. New markets can somewhat be created (e.g., nootropics, elective medicines, Viagra) but generally speaking the markets are well known. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_423860"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are winner-take-all<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Many winners</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_458802"><div><p>In tech, investors often bet on a specific horse with the hope that the horse will win the race (and all the earnings). Bifurcated markets can be especially dangerous as companies compete on pricing and ‘race to the bottom’.</p><p>In biotech, the markets are <em>so </em>large, and the unmet need so high, that there can and often are many winners in one market (disease). The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug. This is despite the average salary in biotech also often being higher than tech’s.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_722809"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Series Seed and A smaller, with larger subsequent rounds to scale and win market share<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Capital needs front-loaded, Seeds can be the size of tech Series A’s</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_745080"><div><p>In tech, you can often show proof-of-concept or even begin selling your product with a small team and pre-seed capital. </p><p>Biotech Seeds can often look like tech Series As in magnitude. On the East Coast, the first rounds in biotech companies are more than often in the $10s of millions. This is because of the millions needed to hit biological milestones to push the company forward (and therefore qualify for the next stage of financing).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_742704"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often command higher valuations early on <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Often command lower valuations early on</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_803591"><div><p>Tech valuations usually optimize for selling 10% - 25% of the company in any one financing. </p><p>In biotech, valuations are historically significantly lower, with many East Coast deals selling 50%+ of the company in one financing. Such huge dilution is less common in West Coast biotech financings, but it is more common sell 33%+ of the company in one financing. Biotech founders also often have less negotiating power here because they have to raise large amounts to bring the company to the next stage. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_805993"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Business usually has significant revenue at exit <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Unlikely to have revenue at exit</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_845025"><div><p>While the company may be far from profitable, tech companies almost always have significant revenue at exit (IPO or acquisition). </p><p>In biotech, companies almost never have revenue at exit.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <div>
<p><a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/07/31/new-mobile-app-help-notify-canadians-potential-covid-19-exposure-now">On July 31st</a>, Canada's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html">COVID Alert</a> app was made available for general use, though it does not have support for actually <em>reporting</em> a diagnosis in most provinces, yet.</p>
<p>In Quebec, we can run the tracing part of the app, and if diagnosis codes become available here, the app can retroactively report contact. It uses the tracing mechanism that <a href="https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing">Google and Apple created together</a>, and in my opinion—at least for now—Canadians should be running this thing to help us all deal with COVID-19. I won't run it forever, but for now, it seems to me that the benefits outweigh the "government can track me" fear (it's not actually tracking you; it doesn't even know who you are), and it's enabled on my phone.</p>
<p>But, before I decided to take this position and offer up my own movement data, I wanted to be sure the app is doing what it says it's doing—at least to the extent of my abilities to be duly diligent. (Note: it's not purely <em>movement</em> data that's shared—at least without more context—but it's actual physical interactions with other people whose phones are available within the radio range of Bluetooth LE.)</p>
<p>Before installing the app on my real daily-carry phone, I decided to put it on an old phone I still have, and to do some analysis on the most basic level of communication: who is it contacting?</p>
<p>In 2015, I gave a <a href="https://prezi.com/iqwzy66rn3uo/inspect-https-with-your-own-man-in-the-middle-non-attacks/">talk</a> at <a href="https://confoo.ca/en">ConFoo</a> entitled "<em>Inspect HTTP(S) with Your Own Man-in-the-Middle Non-Attacks</em>", and this is exactly what I wanted to do here. The tooling has improved in the past 5 years, and firing up <em>mitmproxy</em>, even without ever having used it on this relatively new laptop, was a one-liner, thanks to <a href="https://nixos.org/learn.html">Nix</a>:</p>
<pre><span>nix-shell -p mitmproxy --run mitmproxy</span>
</pre>

<p>This gave me a terminal-based UI and proxy server that I pointed my old phone at (via the Wifi Network settings, under HTTP proxy, pointed to my laptop's local IP address). I needed to have mitmproxy create a Certificate Authority that it could use to generate and sign "trusted" certificates, and then have my phone trust that authority, by visiting <code>http://mitm.it/</code> in mobile Safari, and doing the certificate acceptance dance (this is even more complicated on the latest versions of iOS). Worth noting also, is that certain endpoints such as the Apple App Store appear to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning">Certificate Pinning</a>, so you'll want to do things like install the COVID Alert app from the App Store before turning on the proxy.</p>
<p>Once I was all set up to intercept my own traffic, I visited some <code>https://</code> URLs and saw the request flows in mitmproxy.</p>
<p>I fired up the COVID Alert app again, and noticed something strange… something disturbing:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.scoat.es/covid-tracker-traffic.png" title="COVID Alert app traffic in mitmproxy" alt="shows that the app is accessing clients.google.com"></p>
<p>In addition to the expected traffic to <code>canada.ca</code> (I noticed it's using <code>.alpha.canada.ca</code>, but I suspect that's due to the often-reported unbearably-long bureaucratic hassle in getting a <code>.canada.ca</code> TLS certificate, but that's another story), my phone, when running COVID Alert, was contacting Google.</p>
<pre><span>HEAD https://clients4.google.com/generate_204</span>
</pre>

<p>A little web searching helped me discover that this is a commonly-used endpoint that helps developers determine if the device is behind a "captive portal" (an interaction that requires log-in or payment, or at least acceptance of terms before granting wider access to the Web). I decided that this was <em>probably</em> unintended by the developers of COVID Alert, but it still bothered me that an app, designed for <em>tracking interactions between people['s devices]</em>, that the <em>government</em> wants us to run is telling Google that I'm running it, and disclosing my IP address in doing so:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.scoat.es/covid-alert-google.png" title="A request to clients.google.com, from the COVID Alert app" alt="shows that the User Agent header identifies the app as " covid="" alert="" version=""></p>
<p>(Note that the app clearly identifies itself in the <code>User-Agent</code> header.) </p>
<p>A bit more quick research turned up a <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda-compliance-help/pipeda-interpretation-bulletins/interpretations_02/#fn50-rf">statement by Canada's Privacy Commissioner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address can be considered personal information if it can be associated with an identifiable individual. For example, in one complaint finding, we determined that some of the IP addresses that an internet service provider (ISP) was collecting were personal information because the ISP had the ability to link the IP addresses to its customers through their subscriber IDs.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's not too difficult to imagine that Google <em>probably</em> has enough data on Canadians for this to be a real problem.</p>
<p>I discovered that this app is maintained by the <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/">Canadian Digital Service</a>, and that the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app">source code is on GitHub</a>, but that the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/search?q=clients3.google.com&amp;unscoped_q=clients3.google.com&amp;type=Code">code itself didn't directly contain any references to <code>clients3.google.com</code></a>.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> app, and I figured that the call out to Google must be in one of the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/blob/master/package.json">dependencies</a>, which—considering the norm with JavaScript apps—are pleasantly restrained mostly to React itself. I had no idea which of these libraries was calling out to Google.</p>
<p>Now, I could have run this app on the iOS Simulator (which did I end up doing to test my patches, below), but I thought "let's see what my <em>actual</em> phone is doing." I threw caution to the wind, and I ran <a href="https://checkra.in/">checkra1n</a> on my <em>old</em> phone, which gave me ssh access, which in turn allowed me to copy the app's application bundle to my laptop, where I could do a little more analysis (note the app is bundled as <em>CovidShield</em> because it was previously <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">developed by volunteers at Shopify</a> and was then renamed by CDS (or so I gather, anyway)).</p>
<pre><span>~/De/C/iphone/CovidShield.app ▶ grep -r 'clients3.google.com' *</span>
<span>main.jsbundle:__d(function(g,r,i,a,m,e,d){Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0}),</span>
<span>e.default=void 0;var t={reachabilityUrl:'https://clients3.google.com/generate_204',</span>
<span>reachabilityTest:function(t){return Promise.resolve(204===t.status)},reachabilityShortTimeout:5e3,</span>
<span>reachabilityLongTimeout:6e4,reachabilityRequestTimeout:15e3};e.default=t},708,[]);</span>
</pre>

<p>(Line breaks added for legibility.) Note <code>reachabilityUrl:'https://clients3.google.com/generate_204</code>. Found it! A bit more searching led me to a package called <code>react-native-netinfo</code> (which was directly in the above-linked <code>package.json</code>), and its <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo/blob/4e3e9813fbae89013bbeee6470b005b6d923e022/src/internal/defaultConfiguration.ts#L2">default configuration</a> that sets the <code>reachabilityUrl</code> to Google.</p>
<p>Now that I knew where it was happening, I could fix it.</p>
<p>To make this work the same way, we needed a reliable <code>204</code> endpoint that the app could hit, and to keep with the expectation that this app should not "leak" data outside of <code>canada.ca</code>, I ended up <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/pull/241">submitting a patch</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server">server side code</a> that the app calls. (It turns out that this was not necessary after all, but I'm still glad I added this to my report.)</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/issues/1003">patched</a>, and tested the app code itself via the iOS Simulator.</p>
<p>I then submitted a write-up of what was going wrong and why it's bad, to the main app repository, as <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/issues/1003">cds-snc/covid-alert-app issue 1003</a>, and felt pretty good about my COVID Civic Duty of the day.</p>
<p>The fine folks at the Canadian Digital Service seemed to recognize the problem and agree that it was something that needed to be addressed. A few very professional back-and-forths later (I'll be honest: I barely knew anything about the CDS and I expected some runaround from a government agency like this, and I was pleasantly surprised), we landed on a solution that simply didn't call the reachability URL at all, and they <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/releases">released a version of the app</a> that fixed my issue!</p>
<p><img src="https://files.scoat.es/covid-alert-release.jpg" title="COVID Alert release notes showing my fix" alt=""></p>
<p>With the new version loaded, I once again checked the traffic and can confirm that the new version of the app does not reach out to anywhere but <code>.canada.ca</code>.</p>

				<div>
			
<p>I’ve been working with Amazon Web Services for 6 years or so, and though the cloud has changed a lot in that time, one thing has remained consistent: <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a core pillar of a healthy implementation of AWS.</strong></p>



<p>For anything bigger than a toy cloud application, IaC is table stakes. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone managing anything of scale who thinks letting folks point and click in the console is the optimal route.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>These days, I actually find it faster to just start with all of my applications or even proof-of-concept with an IaC tool and go from there. I, time and time again, have found it easier to return to projects weeks or months later and quickly be able to understand how things work from a familiar baseline and context. I don’t have to rebuild in my mind exactly what I was thinking from scratch.</p>



<p>The “how” of how one approaches IaC is, of course, AWS engineers’ very own version of the old “tabs vs spaces” debate. </p>



<p>So what IAC tools are available to you in AWS, and how do you choose between them?</p>



<h2>AWS CloudFormation</h2>



<p>CloudFormation (CFN) is the original IaC tool for AWS, released in 2011. I have come to respect, hate, love, and revere its power to describe and manage infrastructure. CFN was originally only offered in JSON, but we were finally treated to a heaping helping of tabs vs spaces actually mattering with <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/cloudformation-yaml-and-why-its-awesome">native CFN YAML support in 2016</a>.</p>



<p>CloudFormation is one of the safest ways to build, manage, change, and destroy resources in your infrastructure. It offers robust resource state management, and these days it can tell you what is going to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html">happen before you run your deployment</a>.</p>



<p>A lot of great features have worked to make CloudFormation more enjoyable or productive to work with over the years.</p>



<h3><strong>CloudFormation Macros &amp; Transforms</strong></h3>



<p>One of the more powerful concepts, bringing whole new capabilities to essentially add your own opinionated capabilities to CloudFormation. For example, Trek10 provides a macro that lets you <a href="https://github.com/trek10inc/sfn-yaml-macro">write Step Function Amazon States Language (ASL) with pure yaml</a> and smartly resolves CFN intrinsic functions.</p>



<p>You could imagine being able to provide opinionated IAM policy generators or S3 bucket resource macros. Whatever you want to do, macros can likely get you there. Take note, while powerful, you are treading dangerous territory as it becomes easy to effectively build your own Domain Specific Language. Instead of CloudFormation managing your resources, you are using CloudFormation as a bad Domain-Specific Language compiler that you have to babysit.</p>



<h3><strong>Resource Providers</strong></h3>



<p>For a while, we only had <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html">Custom Resources</a> to provision and manage resources that CloudFormation didn’t natively support. This is now largely superseded by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html">Resource Providers</a> which allow you to create private or published providers to bring the management of third party and unsupported resources into your stacks. For example, <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-as-code-with-datadog-and-cloudformation/">Datadog</a>, a popular monitoring tool can be used in your stack to provision and manage your monitoring without needing some out-of-band process.</p>



<div><p><em>In most of my recent work with CFN, I’ve defaulted to using the AWS Serverless Application Model, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">SAM</a>. SAM is a superset of CFN, with some handy transformations that let you do a bit less typing and wiring up of various resources and permissions. Think of it like a well thought out and “managed” macro. 

If you are doing anything with AWS Lambda or event-driven computing and looking to level up your YAML wrangling, start with SAM.</em></p></div>



<h2>AWS Cloud Development Kit</h2>



<p>AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is the new kid on the block, released in 2019. Using familiar programming languages and provided libraries in TypeScript, Python, Java and .NET developers can write with the same code as the rest of their stack to manage their infrastructure.</p>



<p>CDK, however, is not devoid of CloudFormation. In fact, CDK synthesizes to CloudFormation. You still leverage all the state management and inherent benefits (and downsides) of CloudFormation by adopting CDK.</p>



<p><em>A quick aside: I do want to highlight that some folks view CFN as the “assembly language” of AWS, largely because of how many tools “compile” down to CFN. I think this is a dangerous comparison. It can lead to the interpretation that, like any high-level language to assembly, you don’t really need to understand how the lower-level instruction set works to effectively leverage the higher-level constructs. In my experience, this is patently untrue in the case of CFN. Even a rudimentary understanding of CFN leads to better decisions in the higher level usages like CDK.</em></p>



<p>Ultimately, I would contend that <strong>CDK is the most comfortable and natural entry point for developers to start building Cloud Native applications</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Constructs</strong></h3>



<p>One of the particularly powerful features of CDK that I believe CloudFormation has struggled to natively deliver is the idea of truly shareable and reusable modules. CDK has introduced the concept of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html">constructs</a>. Constructs in practice provide everything from simple wrappings of some specific defaults you would like to re-use across your project all the way to complex multi-resource orchestration and wrapping of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html">resource providers</a>. The distribution method for these constructs then relies on the native</p>



<p>The other important part of CDK Constructs is something neat called <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii">jsii</a>. To quote the project; “jsii allows code in any language to naturally interact with JavaScript classes. It is the technology that enables the AWS Cloud Development Kit to deliver polyglot libraries from a single codebase!” If you write your constructs with TypeScript, it is fairly straight forward to distribute and utilize those constructs across the other core CDK languages – further encouraging sharing of modules.</p>



<p>One of the most elegant ways I can illustrate how nice the CDK experience can be is to put a side-by-side comparison of the usage of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html">Amazon States Language</a> (ASL). </p>



<p>First what it looks like in CloudFormation Native ASL:</p>

    <p>Napkin friends, from near and far, it’s time for another napkin problem!</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this newsletter I’ve posed problems for you to try to
answer. Then in the next month’s edition, you hear my answer. Talking with a few
of you, it seems many of you read these as posts regardless of their
problem-answer format.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ve decided to experiment with a simpler format: posts where I both
present a problem and solution in one go. This one will be long, since it’ll
include an answer to last month’s.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy this format! As always, you are encouraged to reach out with
feedback.</p>
<h2 id="problem-10-is-mysqls-maximum-transactions-per-second-equivalent-to-fsyncs-per-second">Problem 10: Is MySQL’s maximum transactions per second equivalent to fsyncs per second?</h2>
<p>How many transactions (‘writes’) per second is MySQL capable of?</p>
<p>A naive model of how a write (a SQL insert/update/delete) to an ACID-compliant
database like MySQL works might be the following (this applies equally to
Postgres, or any other relational/ACID-compliant databases, but we’ll
proceed to work with MySQL as it’s the one I know best):</p>
<ol>
<li>Client sends query to MySQL over an existing connection: <code>INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Sneaker', 100)</code></li>
<li>MySQL inserts the new record to the write-ahead-log (WAL) and calls
<code>fsync(2)</code> to tell the operating system to tell the filesystem to tell the
disk to make <em>sure</em> that this data is <em>for sure</em>, pinky-swear committed to
the disk. This step, being the most complex, is depicted below.</li>
<li>MySQL inserts the record into an in-memory page in the backing storage engine
(InnoDB) so the record will be visible to subsequent queries. Why commit to
the storage engine <em>and</em> the WAL? The storage engine is optimized for serving
query results the data, and the WAL for writing it in a safe manner – we
can’t serve a <code>SELECT</code> efficiently from the WAL!</li>
<li>MySQL returns <code>OK</code> to the client.</li>
<li>MySQL eventually calls <code>fsync(2)</code> to ensure InnoDB commits the page to disk.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97400/87759326-21adeb00-c7dc-11ea-89c7-559ca11530e8.png" alt="Napkin_10"></p>
<p>In the event of power-loss at any of these points, the behaviour can be defined
without nasty surprises, upholding our dear ACID-compliance.</p>
<p>Splendid! Now that we’ve constructed a naive model of how a relational database
might handle writes safely, we can consider the latency of inserting a new
record into the database. When we consult <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math">the reference napkin numbers</a>, we
see that the <code>fsync(2)</code> in step (2) is by <em>far</em> the slowest operation in the
blocking chain at 1 ms.</p>
<p>For example, the network handling at step (1) takes roughly ~10 μs (TCP Echo
Server is what we can classify as ‘the TCP overhead’). The <code>write(2)</code> itself
prior to the <code>fsync(2)</code> is also negligible at ~10 μs, since this system call
essentially just writes to an in-memory buffer (the ‘page cache’) in the kernel.
This doesn’t guarantee the actual bits are committed on disk, which means an
unexpected loss of power would erase the data, dropping our ACID-compliance on
the floor. Calling <code>fsync(2)</code> guarantees us the bits are persisted on the disk,
which will survive an unexpected system shutdown.  Downside is that it’s 100x
slower.</p>
<p>With that, we should be able to form a simple hypothesis on the maximum
throughput of MySQL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum theoretical throughput of MySQL is equivalent to the maximum
number of <code>fsync(2)</code> per second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know that <code>fsync(2)</code> takes 1 ms from earlier, which means we would naively
expect that MySQL would be able to perform in the neighbourhood of: <code>1s / 1ms/fsync = 1000 fsyncs/s = 1000 transactions/s</code> .</p>
<p>Excellent. We followed the first three of the napkin math steps: (1) Model the
system, (2) Identify the relevant latencies, (3) Do the napkin math, (4) Verify
the napkin calculations against reality.</p>
<p>On to (4: Verifying)! We’ll write a simple benchmark in Rust that writes to
MySQL with 16 threads, doing 1,000 insertions each:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>for</span><span> </span>i<span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>0</span>..<span>16</span><span> </span>{<span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>This takes ~3 seconds to perform 16,000 insertions, or ~5,300 insertions per
second. This is <strong>5x</strong> more than the 1,000 <code>fsync</code> per second our napkin math
told us would be the theoretical maximum transactional throughput!</p>
<p>Typically with napkin math we aim for being within an order of magnitude, which
we are. But, when I do napkin math it usually establishes a lower-bound for the
system, i.e. from first-principles, how fast <em>could</em> this system perform in
ideal circumstances?</p>
<p>Rarely is the system 5x faster than napkin math. When we identify a
significant-ish gap between the real-life performance and the expected
performance, I call it the “first-principle gap.” This is where curiosity sets
in. It typically means there’s (1) an opportunity to improve the system, or (2)
a flaw in our model of the system. In this case, only (2) makes sense, because
the system is faster than we predicted.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with our model of how the system works? Why aren’t fsyncs per
second equal to transactions per second?</p>
<p>First I examined the benchmark… is something wrong? Nope <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products</code> says 16,000. Is the MySQL I’m using configured to not <code>fsync</code> on every
write? Nope, it’s at the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit">safe default</a>.</p>
<p>Then I sat down and thought about it. Perhaps MySQL is <em>not</em> doing an <code>fsync</code>
for every <em>single</em> write? If it’s processing 5,300 insertions per second,
perhaps it’s batching multiple writes together as part of writing to the WAL,
step (2) above? Since each transaction is so short, MySQL would benefit from
waiting a few microseconds to see if other transactions want to ride along
before calling the expensive <code>fsync(2)</code>.</p>
<p>We can test this hypothesis by writing a simple <code>bpftrace</code> script to observe the
number of <code>fsync(1)</code> for the ~16,000 insertions:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="d"><span>tracepoint:</span>syscalls<span>:</span>sys_enter_fsync<span>,</span>tracepoint<span>:</span>syscalls<span>:</span>sys_enter_fdatasync
<span>/</span>comm <span>==</span> <span>"mysqld"</span><span>/</span>
<span>{</span>
        <span>@fsyncs</span> <span>=</span> count<span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Running this during the ~3 seconds it takes to insert the 16,000 records we get
~8,000 <code>fsync</code> calls:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo bpftrace fsync_count.d
Attaching <span>2</span> probes...
^C

@fsyncs: <span>8037</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is a peculiar number. If MySQL was batching fsyncs, we’d expect something
far lower. This number means that we’re on average doing ~2,500 <code>fsync</code> per
second, at a latency of ~0.4ms. This is twice as fast as the <code>fsync</code> latency we
expect, the 1ms mentioned earlier. For sanity, I ran the script to benchmark
<code>fsync</code> outside MySQL again, no, <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/fe780331c6f0c6f225a70c8a37c21e0740f7c73c/src/main.rs#L491">still 1ms</a>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/sirupsen/9fd5fe9466e82df073ed8a13ed1f661f#file-napkin-bash">Looked at the
distribution</a>, and it was consistently ~1ms.</p>
<p>So there’s two things we can draw from this: (1) We’re able to <code>fsync</code> more than
twice as fast as we expect, (2) Our hypothesis was correct that MySQL is more
clever than doing one <code>fsync</code> per transaction, however, since <code>fsync</code> also was
faster than expected, this didn’t explain everything.</p>
<p>If you remember from above, while committing the transaction could theoretically
be a single <code>fsync</code>, other features of MySQL might also call <code>fsync</code>. Perhaps
they’re adding noise?</p>
<p>We need to group <code>fsync</code> by file descriptor to get a better idea of how MySQL
uses <code>fsync</code>. However, the raw file descriptor number doesn’t tell us much. We
can use <code>readlink</code> and the <code>proc</code> file-system to obtain the file name the file
descriptor points to. Let’s write a <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace"><code>bpftrace</code> script</a> to see what’s being
<code>fsync</code>'ed:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>What we can observe here is that the majority of the writes are to the “redo
log”, what we call the “write-ahead-log” (WAL). There’s a few <code>fsync</code> calls to
commit the InnoDB table-space, not nearly as often, as we can always recover
this from the WAL in case we crash between them. Reads work just fine prior to
the <code>fsync</code>, as the queries can simply be served out of memory from InnoDB.</p>
<p>The only surprising thing here is the substantial volume of writes to the
binlog, which we haven’t mentioned before. You can think of the binlog as the
“replication stream.” It’s a stream of events such as <code>row a changed from x to y</code>, <code>row b was deleted</code>, and <code>table u added column c</code>. The primary replica
streams this to the read-replicas, which use it to update their own data.</p>
<p>When you think about it, the <code>binlog</code> and the WAL need to be kept exactly in
sync. We can’t have something committed on the primary replica, but not
committed to the replicas. If they’re not in sync, this could cause loss of data
due to drift in the read-replicas. The primary could commit a change to the WAL,
lose power, recover, and never write it to the …</p></div></div>

<p>The greatest common divisor is something I learned in school but it was one of those “so what?” subjects. But recently I revisited it and it is very interesting.</p>



<p><strong>Why is gcd cool?</strong></p>



<p>Every number, can be expressed as the product of prime numbers. This product for every number is unique; sort of like saying, every number has a fingerprint. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>. 36 is <code>4x9</code>, and 45 is <code>5x9</code>. This means that some numbers will have common parts with each other.</p>



<p>These common parts can divide both numbers, and thus they are common divisors. In the example above, 36 is <code>4x9</code> or <code>2x2x3x3</code>, while 45 is <code>5x3x3</code>; 3 is a common divisor of both, so is <code>3x3</code>, which is 9; but 9 is the greatest divisor of both 36 and 45.</p>



<p>One question I had when I was younger, was why we are talking about the “greatest” and not the smallest common divisor. We could, but soon, this gets boring: there is 1, the smallest common divisor of every number, then there are some common divisors in between 1 and the gcd. But what the gcd does so uniquely, is that it takes two numbers and gives us <em>all</em> the common parts of two numbers. </p>

The gcd of 36 and 45 is 9.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is cool! The uncommon parts are relatively prime! — meaning, they have nothing in common but the number 1. </p>



<p>So to find the gcd, then, we need to find all the common parts of the two numbers when written in terms of their prime factors. </p>



<p><code>36=3x3x2x2</code> and <code>45=3x3x5</code>, thus the gcd of 36 and 45 is <code>3x3</code>, which is 9. So 36 is 9(4) and 45 is 9(5). It is very interesting to look at numbers as multiples of gcds. Moreover, notice that these multipliers, 4 and 5 in the example above, are relatively prime. </p>



<p><strong>The magic of subtraction</strong></p>



<p>Subtracting two relatively prime numbers, will produce another number that, while not necessarily prime itself, will be relatively prime to both the previous numbers. As an example, <code>13-7=6</code>. 6 is not prime, but it is relatively prime to both 7 and 13. If we subtract 6 from 13 we will get 7 again which is not very interesting. But if we subtract 6 from 7, the smaller one, since 6 and 7 are relatively prime we should get another number that is relatively prime to them both; <code>7-6=1</code>, which is relatively prime to every other number, if keep doing this:</p>


<pre title="">13 -  7 = 6
7  -  6 = 1
6  -  1 = 5
5  -  1 = 4
4  -  1 = 3
3  -  1 = 2
2  -  1 = 1
1  -  1 = 0

(1, 0)
</pre>


<p>The final two numbers are 0 and 1. So whenever we start with two relatively prime numbers and do this on them, it will always end with 0 and 1. This is pretty strange and magical. I am still perplexed by it, but the way I convinced myself, is to think about it bottom up: if we start with the number 1, and try to build our way to any other number by addition, there are finite number of ways. So when we start subtracting, what we are doing is walking that path backwards towards 1. </p>

<p>Now why do these two numbers need to be relatively prime? because if they are not relatively prime, that means that they have some parts in common, like 36 and 45 above, remember? they are 9(4) and 9(5). If we do the subtracting trick on them:</p>


<pre title="">9(5) - 9(4) = 9(1)
9(4) - 9(1) = 9(3)
9(3) - 9(1) = 9(2)
9(2) - 9(1) = 9(1)
9(1) - 9(1) = 9(0)

(9(1), 0)
</pre>


<p>So you see, the common part survives the subtractions, while the uncommon parts converge to 1. But 9 is <em>all</em> the common parts of 36 and 45, in other words the gcd of 36 and 45! </p>



<p>Can we keep subtracting any two numbers until we reach (X, 0) and then proclaim X is the greatest common divisor? yes, we can, and it is called the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidean Algorithm</a></em>.</p>



<p>Here is a silly experiment, what if we subtract the partially common parts? for 36 and 45, what if we wrote them as 3(12) and 3(15)?</p>


<pre title="">3(15) -  3(12) = 3(3)
3(12) -  3(3)  = 3(9)
3(9)  -  3(3)  = 3(6)
3(6)  -  3(3)  = 3(3)
3(3)  -  3(3)  = 3(0)

(3(3), 0)
</pre>


<p>This is really funny. The algorithm basically told us that the gcd of 12 and 15 is 3. Now if we choose to multiply the other 3 that we have factored out before we started our subtraction, it will yield the same result: the gcd of 36 and 45 is 9.</p>



<p><strong>What just happened?</strong></p>



<p>We started by finding the gcd of two numbers, then subtracting the uncommon, relatively prime parts to realize we always reach 1, so if we always subtract any two numbers from each other repeatedly, since the gcd is a common factor of both, it will remain constant until the end, when the uncommon parts have reduced down to 1 and 0; and then what we are left with is the gcd. </p>



<p>Here is a recursive implementation of it in Python:</p>


<pre title="">def gcd(a,b):
    if a == 0: return b
    if b == 0: return a

    return gcd(abs(a-b), min(a,b))
</pre>


<p>If someone has a better explanation of why subtracting relatively prime numbers repeatedly will always result in one, please leave a comment or reach out and help me understand better.</p>

This is still the looming question, and it’s time to address it. </h3><p id="viewer-9k73p">First, though, imagine that someone in a public forum online asked me, “How much metoprolol (a common blood pressure medication) should I take?” It would be clear that I could not give a real answer. I could give a heavily qualified blanket statement that covered indications and common starting doses, and then recommended speaking with a doctor regarding a personalized dosage. I wouldn’t give a specific dose. But no one would expect me to.  Metoprolol is a medication, and medications are usually prescribed by a physician.</p><p id="viewer-7tpp4">We think of vitamins and supplements differently. A few readers have made comments like this: “I understand that the evidence for Vitamin D in healthy adults doesn’t really show a benefit, but I take Vitamin D because it probably won’t hurt me, and it might help.” This is a common sentiment regarding supplements, but not a statement that most people would make about metoprolol, or any prescribed medication.  Medications are generally understood to be substances taken in response to a specific disease or condition, and we hope that research has shown that they work. Supplements are given a pass; we take them if they might help, even though they may not be needed. </p><p id="viewer-2fbtq"><strong>But Vitamin D should be thought of as a medication</strong>, despite being sold over-the-counter in the supplements aisle. </p><p id="viewer-5549c">To illustrate this, let me introduce Shannon. </p><p id="viewer-518ch">In the fall of 2018, Shannon R. was the special education director for a large Arizona school district. Normally energetic and expressive, the otherwise healthy 38-year-old began having an odd and disturbing symptom: difficulty speaking. Her husband and two boys would ask her questions, and though understanding the question, she was unable to formulate the words to respond. </p><p id="viewer-e7f4v">Milder problems had started over the summer, when she felt more tired than usual. As the months passed, new symptoms appeared: palpitations, insomnia, anxiety, along with cognitive deficits – “like my brain wouldn’t function,” she recalled. Her heart rate, normally in the 60s, now often stayed in the 90s, even while in bed. She barely slept at night and lost nearly 50 pounds. By mid-semester, she was often unable to work. At around 1 AM one October morning, she was taken to the emergency room for a racing heart. When there, she had difficulty responding to the doctors’ and nurses’ questions. After a full workup, the doctors had no explanation, so they resorted to what doctors often reach for when confronted with mystery ailments: psychiatric illness. </p><p id="viewer-fu7id">Shannon would be hospitalized several times for “catatonia,” a general symptom describing difficulty with speaking or moving that is caused by certain psychiatric conditions like depression and schizophrenia. Though she had never exhibited mental illness before, doctors assumed that Shannon had developed a severe psychiatric disorder. </p><p id="viewer-4pb27">Shannon’s husband, as well as her new psychiatrist, doubted this diagnosis, and sought second and third opinions. By the time she contacted me four months later, they had consulted multiple specialists at three different hospitals around the state, but still did not have an explanation for her physical and mental decline. There was something that all of the doctors had noticed, though. Her blood calcium levels were often mildly to moderately elevated above normal, up to 11.1 mg/dl (normal for her age would be up to 10.2 mg/dl). The cause of this was unclear, but her doctors did not believe that this incidental finding was relevant to her current issues, and did not pursue it. <strong>Shannon was not taking calcium supplements at all throughout this time, but her levels were still high.</strong> When she emailed me in February 2019, she was desperate for answers and thought the calcium levels might be a clue. </p><p id="viewer-1miap">My specialty is parathyroid disease, which is the most common cause of high calcium. Based on her parathyroid hormone tests, it did not appear that Shannon had parathyroid disease. But she had high calcium levels, and the rise in those levels correlated with the onset of her symptoms. High calcium levels might initially appear to be a good thing, since we need calcium for our bones. But they are not. High blood calcium levels usually indicate a serious illness.</p><div id="viewer-ep36c"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-2-shannon-s-story?postId=5f39453f8d01fe00170023fe" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_ab9b4f52fab24f4aaf3be163ee13d0ca~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_434,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_ab9b4f52fab24f4aaf3be163ee13d0ca~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5d4om"><em>Calcium is known for its role in bone health, but its role in the brain and nervous system is just as important. Calcium levels need to be within a small range; anything too high or too low can cause problems.  Image by </em><a href="https://www.bigstockphoto.com/search/?contributor=madrock24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">madrock24</a> on <a href="http://bigstockphoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>bigstockphoto.com</u></a></p><p id="viewer-115r5">Most patients with high calcium develop fatigue and body aches, and just generally feel bad. They may develop insomnia and palpitations, a feeling like the heart is racing. Some have more severe neurologic symptoms like muscle weakness and problems with balance, and some have psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety. Untreated high calcium can also lead to kidney stones, kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmias, headaches, and gastrointestinal problems. Shannon had some of the classic symptoms, as well as what appeared to be more severe “psychiatric” symptoms. I suspected they were all related to her calcium levels. </p><p id="viewer-bac7q">But why was her calcium high? The parathyroid glands exist to regulate calcium, and they do a very good job at it, keeping blood calcium within a tight range. Usually, a problem with calcium indicates a problem with the parathyroids. But over the last few years I have had more patients coming to me with high calcium related to something else: Vitamin D. </p><p id="viewer-6d1js"><strong>Vitamin D is a steroid hormone</strong>, in the same category as sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and glucocorticoids like the stress hormone cortisol. Steroid hormones are all made from cholesterol, and looking at their molecular structures, you can see the similarities. </p><div id="viewer-6s0p9"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-2-shannon-s-story?postId=5f39453f8d01fe00170023fe" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1ef7e9201aae4b54be7b21f6f218627e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1586,h_972,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1ef7e9201aae4b54be7b21f6f218627e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-3upia">Like the other steroid hormones, Vitamin D acts on multiple organs and only tiny amounts of the molecule are required to have substantial effects. Anyone who has gone through puberty understands the impressive physiologic changes brought about by relatively small shifts in hormone levels. Not surprisingly, most steroid hormones are considered medications that require a physician's order. Vitamin D is an exception. In the U.S., high dose Vitamin D can be purchased by anyone, without a prescription, in most drugstores and grocery stores. It is called a dietary supplement, which sounds safer than a medication, but this is misleading. Due to its role in calcium absorption, high dose Vitamin D can cause serious problems. </p><p id="viewer-21t00">Eventually we worked out what happened with Shannon: In 2013 she was diagnosed with mild osteopenia, a thinning of the bones that can be a precursor to osteoporosis. Her Vitamin D was low at the time, so her physician started her on over-the-counter Vitamin D supplementation at 5000 international units (IUs) daily. Five years later, she was still on this dose, and her blood Vitamin D level had risen to 79 ng/ml. This level is within what many labs call the normal range, between 30 and 100 ng/ml, but levels above 70 are almost always a result of high dose supplementation, and I have seen toxicity with levels between 70 and 100 ng/ml. (A better “normal range” based on what I have seen would probably be between 30 and 60.) Vitamin D builds up over time, so the longer someone is on a high dose, the more likely she is to develop toxicity. Shannon’s calcium levels began rising in the fall of 2018, when her severe symptoms developed. </p><p id="viewer-c0tav">Ironically, Shannon started to recover because she became too sick to worry about taking her vitamins, and stopped taking Vitamin D in October. It often takes many months for high Vitamin D levels to drop, and it took six months for Shannon’s level to fall into the 50s. As it fell, her calcium level gradually started to normalize, and her symptoms slowly resolved. By May, she was starting to feel like herself again. </p><p id="viewer-208hf">I spoke with Shannon recently. All of the symptoms that characterized her frightening and rapid decline in health had resolved completely. Listening to this animated woman, it was difficult to imagine her unable to talk. The only lingering effects appeared to be a wariness of physicians and distrust of vitamins, both understandable. Shannon agrees that Vitamin D should be treated like a medication. “It’s a hormone!” she exclaimed. “If I had to take ‘Hormone D’, I would have questioned my doctor about why I needed it.” Shannon is now committed to educating others about Vitamin D. </p><p id="viewer-16oc8">Of course, there is a selection bias in who comes to me. There are people out there doing just fine on 5000 units of Vitamin D daily. I only see the ones who develop high calcium levels. But I see enough of them to know that this is not an exceptionally rare occurrence. I have been to lectures in which physicians have claimed that Vitamin D toxicity almost never occurs. In my experience, this is false. I have seen many cases of Vitamin D toxicity in people who were taking the recommended dose from an over-the-counter bottle.</p><p id="viewer-8pgar">Unfortunately, none of those patients were warned about the potential for Vitamin D to cause high calcium. They all believed that they were taking a supplement to improve health and that there was very little risk. Supplements don’t require prescriptions, and most do not have the warning labels that accompany medications. For Vitamin D, a steroid hormone, that may need to change. </p><p id="viewer-4ie1g"><strong>So, how much Vitamin D should you take? </strong></p><p id="viewer-9iecb">Vitamin D should be approached like a medication that is used to treat low calcium levels and low levels of the hormone called Vitamin D. The dose depends on your calcium and current Vitamin D levels, and needs to be adjusted appropriately in response to those levels. For my patients, I can and do give very specific recommendations on Vitamin D doses. In future posts, I can go through how I decide that. I will not give any recommendation without first knowing Vitamin D and calcium levels. </p><p id="viewer-ecd8g"><strong>Edited to add: This post should not be taken as a …</strong></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. It’s always possible to discover the <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">frontier of your own knowledge</a> and to expand it.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<!-- <div class="unfurl-embed-info-media-default gallery-item-selectable"><img class="unfurl-embed-card-feature-image" src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image.png"><div class="unfurl-embed-card-title unfurl-embed-card-title-default notranslate"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">The RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase, an Emerging Antiviral Drug Target for the Hendra Virus - PubMed</a></div><div class="unfurl-embed-card-description unfurl-embed-card-description-default notranslate"><div style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 2;">Australia is facing a major national medical challenge with the emergence of the Hendra virus (HeV) as a medically and economically important pathogen of humans and animals.

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p>*plus the 5’ cap, discussed below</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

Their stories are ones of success, of inspiration. They show us what is possible, and push us to achieve more.</p><p>But I don't feel inspired when I see extraordinary. I feel disappointed, jealous. My constant exposure to these amazing stories of success has normalized the extraordinary. I started comparing myself to these "normal" extraordinary people, and wondered why I was not them. This disappointment would incite me to take action, but after a few days of hard work, I would just quit. Quitting was easier; it helped me avoid thinking about the extraordinary and the negative dark clouds that I had shrouded it with.</p><p>This mentality was self-defeating. No one starts off as extraordinary, so that meant I quit a lot in the past. Over time, I came to realize two things:</p><ol><li>extraordinary as I perceived it was one-dimensional and unrealistic,</li><li>to improve, extraordinary could not be my end goal.</li></ol><p><strong>We need to redefine extraordinary.</strong> Extraordinary is often defined by the internet as a permanent trait someone has. They seemed to have been born with it, and extraordinary permeates their every pore. </p><p>But real extraordinary is nothing like this. Yes, it's exciting, but it also comes with sacrifices, limitations, and constraints. And it's not permanent. Extraordinary can disappear over time, just like you can achieve it over time.</p><p>Extraordinary also comes in many forms, and its value does not have to be measured in terms of money. You can be a tech giant who built their entire empire from scratch, just as you can be an amazing organizer who rallies entire communities together for a single cause. You can be a top-notch violinist player, or a inspiring storyteller. Extraordinary can be anything. Sometimes, when you realize what extraordinary really entails, you might not even want it. That's okay.</p><p><strong>Extraordinary should not be the end goal.</strong> I like to envision the extraordinary space in society as a small ledge at the top of a cliff. It gives you a beautiful view and a sense of accomplishment, but is also tight and oppressing. The sheer physical constraints means that not everyone will reach it. But that shouldn't stop you from putting a hand on the cliff and lifting yourself towards that ledge.</p><p>Why? Because the ledge is not the only thing that exists. There is a vast amount of space under it, other ledges, crooks, and crannies, that most people forget about. That space is just as valuable.</p><p>For example, someone starting out on Youtube might be disappointed that they don't have millions of subscribers. They don't think they have what it takes, so they quit. But most people don't only look at the channels with millions of subscribers. Smaller ones are as valuable for viewers, and the creators can get just as much value out of creating their original content and connecting with like-minded people.</p><p>So instead of searching for an extraordinary that is distorted and unrealistic, search to climb up to some space beneath the top ledge. You will be less disappointed and jealous, and you will still maintain some velocity in the right direction. Climbing to a higher vantage point can also unlock new forms of extraordinary that you might have never noticed before.</p><p>By consistently climbing and reassessing which direction to take, you might just reach your own extraordinary as a bonus.</p></section></div></div>]]>

  <p>Bishop Peder Winstrup of Lund, Sweden passed away in the winter of 1679 at the age of 74 and was interred in a crypt at Lund Cathedral. Three centuries later, his astonishingly well-preserved remains provide insights to the origins of tuberculosis.</p>
  

  

  <p>In a recent study published in <em>Genome Biology</em>, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Lund University and the Swedish Natural Historical Museum present analysis of the highest quality ancient Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome to date, suggesting the pathogen is much younger than previously believed.</p>

<p>When Anthropologist Caroline Arcini and her colleagues at the Swedish Natural Historical Museum discovered small calcifications in the extremely well preserved lungs of Bishop Peder Winstrup, they knew more investigation was needed. “We suspected these were remnants of a past lung infection,” says Arcini, “and tuberculosis was at the top of our list of candidates. DNA analysis was the best way to prove it.”</p>
<p>Up to one quarter of the world’s population is suspected to have been exposed to bacteria of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex, which cause tuberculosis (TB). Bishop Winstrup would have been one of many to fall ill during the onset of the so-called “White Plague” TB pandemic that ravaged post-medieval Europe. Today, TB is among the most prevalent diseases, accounting for the highest worldwide mortality from a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>The global distribution of TB has led to the prevailing assumption that the pathogen evolved early in human history and reached its global distribution via the hallmark Out of Africa human migrations tens of thousands of years ago, but recent work on ancient TB genomes has stirred up controversy over when this host-pathogen relationship began. In 2014, a team led by scientists from the University of Tübingen and Arizona State University reconstructed three ancient TB genomes from pre-contact South America – not only were the ancient strains unexpectedly related to those circulating in present-day seals, but comparison against a large number of human strains suggested that TB emerged within the last 6000 years. Understandably, skepticism surrounded this new estimate since it was based entirely on ancient genomes that are not representative of the TB strains associated with humans today.</p>
<p>“Discovery of the Bishop’s lung calcification gave us the opportunity to revisit the question of tuberculosis emergence with data from an ancient European,” comments Kirsten Bos, group leader for Molecular Paleopathology at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (MPI-SHH), who co-led the study. “If we could reconstruct a TB genome from Bishop Winstrup, where we know his date of death to the day, it would give a secure and independent calibration for our estimates of how old TB, as we know it, actually is.”</p>
<p><b>The highest quality ancient TB genome to date&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>In a new study published this week in Genome Biology, Susanna Sabin of MPI-SHH and colleagues reconstruct a tuberculosis genome from the calcified nodule discovered in Bishop Winstrup's remains.</p>
<p>“The genome is of incredible quality – preservation on this scale is extremely rare in ancient DNA,” comments Bos.</p>

<p>Together with a handful of tuberculosis genomes from other work, the researchers revisit the question of the age of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, with the year of the Bishop’s death as a fine-tuned calibration point. Using multiple molecular dating models, all angles indeed point to a relatively young age of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex.</p>
<p>“A more recent emergence of the tuberculosis pathogen complex is now supported by genetic evidence from multiple geographic regions and time periods,” comments Sabin, first author of the study. “It’s the strongest evidence available to date for this emergence having been a Neolithic phenomenon.”</p>
<p>This most recent shift in the narrative for when bacteria in the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>complex became highly infectious to humans raises further questions about the context of its emergence, as it appears to have coincided with the rise of pastoralism and sedentary lifestyles.</p>
<p>“The Neolithic transition seems to have played an important role for the emergence of a number of human pathogens,” comments Denise Kühnert, group leader for disease transmission research at MPI-SHH who co-led the investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For TB in particular, stronger evidence could only come from an older genome, though these deeper time periods are unlikely to yield preservation on the scale of what we’ve seen for Bishop Winstrup,” adds Bos.</p>
<p>“Moving forward,” Sabin further comments, “the hope is we will find adequately preserved DNA from time periods close to the emergence of the complex, or perhaps from its ancestor.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Securing a job this year is going to be a struggle for most people. Whether you're a new graduate trying to get your foot in the door of an industry, or you've been made redundant and are looking to get back on your feet. Whatever your circumstances, your chances of getting a great new job usually start in the same place as everyone else: your CV. Here's how to write a CV that recruiters will <em>want</em> to read.</p><hr><p>Before we get started, <strong>who am I, and why should you listen to me?</strong> I'm currently an Associate at a global asset management firm, and I review the CVs of vulnerable people for a British charity (<a href="https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/">The Prince's Trust</a>). Recruitment, and resumes in particular, are something I see all the time, and I'd love to share a few tips to help you improve yours. Still interested? Let's get started!</p><p>I completely see the appeal of including everything you've ever done of note in your CV. These achievements were likely hard-won, and you have a right to be proud of them, no matter how small they are. But a lot of the CVs I've read come out at over the three-page mark. The chances of all three pages being critically relevant to the role that you've applied for are near-zero. </p><p>Think about when you're trying to choose between a handful of different products to buy - are you looking to read three pages of prose about each one? Or would you prefer a <strong>single, focused page</strong>, with the most relevant features for you highlighted in bold?</p><blockquote><p>If your CV is the length of a short novel, you are likely not even making it to the evaluation stage.</p></blockquote><p>Recruiters are inundated with CVs to read, and the best way to make sure yours isn't passed over immediately is making it as easy as possible to extract information from it. If your CV is the length of a short novel, you are likely not even making it to the evaluation stage. It's too difficult to pull out the relevant information to make a decision, from such a large sea of text. You're getting passed over. Brevity, and focus will give you a fighting chance of making it through. So stick to one page.</p><p>One of the most common reasons I've seen for lengthy CVs is that the candidate is applying for a variety of jobs, often in entirely different industries, with vastly different skills required. Instead of trying to cram <em>all</em> of your experience into a single one-size-fits-all CV, try to create separate CVs for each <em>type</em> of role you're applying for. </p><p><img alt="/static/cv/image_(1).png" src="https://blog.zeshan.me/static/cv/image_(1).png"></p><p>For example, when applying for a customer service role, you could use the version that emphasises your retail experience and social skills. If you're applying for a job as an engineer, you can use the CV that emphasises your degree and engineering projects, and so on. This focus will give you a much higher chance of success in each role.</p><p>All of this customisation sounds like a lot of work, but here's a really quick, simple way to get it done, without writing any new content:</p><ol><li>Create a "parent" document, with all of the possible things you could include on your CV.</li><li>For each type of job (e.g. sales, recruitment, engineer), create a new blank document and copy over the sections, jobs, or achievements that are most relevant for that job type. Make sure you keep to a single page!</li></ol><p><img alt="/static/cv/image_(4).png" src="https://blog.zeshan.me/static/cv/image_(4).png"></p><p>When it comes to making it easy for employers to pick out information from your CV, bullet points have a massive advantage over prose. Here's a bullet pointed list to explain why:</p><ul><li>They naturally force you to divide your thoughts into easily-digestible, bite-sized chunks.</li><li>They release you from having to make your sentences be entirely grammatically correct, freeing up valuable space on  the page.</li><li>Your ideas become more cohesive, as a single bullet point stands alone, and has to make sense without the reader having read everything around it.</li><li>The reader can clearly see the start and end of each piece of information on the page, and their eyes can dart and dash around to whatever catches their attention.</li></ul><p>All of this adds to the readability of your CV, and massively reduces the amount of time needed to figure out whether you're a suitable candidate.</p><p>A common piece of advice for CVs is to use the <strong>STAR</strong> (Situation-Task-Activity-Result) format for each bullet point. I think that this is excessive and can lead a lot of people into writing long sections of prose, which is (as already mentioned) harder to read quickly. I recommend flipping this idea on its head, and including the minimum information needed to make the point. Try starting with just Activity-Result, or <strong>AR</strong>, for each bullet point, and add only as much context as you need for the sentence to make sense.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><hr><h3>Before</h3><p><em>In July 2019, I actively sought a month-long intensive Italian language course to bring my year abroad to a close. I spent my evenings and weekends developing my language skills through rigorous self-study, as well as orchestrating events and trips for myself and fellow students, including a wine-tasting evening at a local restaurant.</em></p><h3>After (using AR format)</h3><ul><li><em>Month-long <strong>intensive Italian language course</strong> completed during a year abroad.</em></li><li><em>Organised 4 cultural trips and events for fellow students, <strong>communicating fluently</strong> with local businesses to negotiate a <strong>40% volume discount</strong> for our group's excursions.</em></li></ul><hr><h3>Before</h3><p><em>Between March 2018 and September 2019, I was employed at Johnson's News Accounting Centre during university holidays. This was initially a temporary administrative role, but my efficient independent management of a bulk mail output led to my contract being extended and my position changed to Accounts Payable Clerk. I had no prior experience in accounting, but my quick progression demonstrates my ability to quickly adapt to new professional challenges. The role required me to contact suppliers by telephone, process and manage invoice payments, chase senior employees to commence the receipting process, use relevant software systems including SAP, and carry out various administrative tasks. I also voluntarily completed out-of-hours work at busy periods, such as year-end.</em></p><h3>After (using AR format)</h3><ul><li><em>Independently managed two <strong>national-scale bulk mail outputs</strong> (March 2018 &amp; July 2018).</em></li><li><em>Success in this administrative project led to my <strong>contract being extended</strong> and being <strong>promoted</strong> to Accounts Payable Clerk.</em></li></ul><hr><blockquote><p>Apply this idea across your entire CV, and your biggest accomplishments will be screaming out to the hiring manager</p></blockquote><p>If I asked you to tell me the most impressive things mentioned in the <em>"Before"</em> excerpts, it'd probably take you a while, and you'd hate every minute of it. But notice how much easier the <em>"After"</em> versions are to scan, and to pick out key achievements from. Apply this idea across your entire CV, and your biggest accomplishments will be screaming out to the hiring manager - leaving you with a much better chance of making it past résumé screens.</p><blockquote><p>This is a crucial component of a good CV, and is what elevates your content from a boring description of your duties to a solid sales pitch.</p></blockquote><p>If you're using the STAR format for bullet points, or my trimmed down AR format from above, they both suggest you end on the same point: results. Whatever task or activity you did, what was the outcome? What impact did you have? This is a crucial component of a good CV, and is what elevates your content from a boring description of your duties to a solid sales pitch. </p><p>If you "served customers efficiently", why not mention that you reduced the average customer's waiting time by 20%? If you "implemented a smarter checkout system", why not mention that it increased revenues by £100k after it was deployed?</p><p><img alt="/static/cv/image_(2).png" src="https://blog.zeshan.me/static/cv/image_(2).png"></p><p>The more you can focus on what you <strong>achieved</strong>, rather than what you <strong>did</strong>, the more impressive your CV will seem. Including numbers makes your achievements measurable, and makes them much more credible. They also give a sense of scale, showing the hiring manager just how much impact you could have if they choose to hire you. </p><p>The format and style of your CV can be a massive boost to how professional you seem. Equally, the greatest text content in the world will be ignored entirely if it's delivered in the professional equivalent of rainbow Comic Sans. It really matters how your CV looks at a glance - it would be a massive shame for poor formatting to prevent your actual profile from even being considered.</p><h2>Templates</h2><p>I find that CVs using a <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv">LaTeX template</a> usually look the most professional due to the clean typography and rigid formatting. It's harder for things to look "off" in LaTeX, as by default you're given much less control over layout. One of my favourite starting points (and the one I used as a base for my own CV) is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/software-engineer-resume/gqxmqsvsbdjf">this template by Sourabh Bajaj</a>. Even if you don't know how to use LaTeX, you can get to grips with it relatively quickly: just clone a template using Overleaf, and start replacing the placeholder content with your own. If you want to avoid LaTeX, I'd recommend recreating a similar look and feel in your word processor of choice.</p><h2>Fonts</h2><p>Keep the number of colours used to a minimum. Black-and-white, or tasteful use of a single color, will prevent your CV from looking too busy. Use <strong>bold</strong> to make keywords stand out.</p><p>Avoid using a default font like Calibri. I recommend a serif from <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern">Computer Modern</a> (this is LaTeX's default font), or a professional sans-serif like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter</a>. Google Fonts has a large number of free fonts for you to download, but stick to a maximum of two: one for headings and one for body text. <a href="https://fontpair.co/">FontPair</a> can help you to choose fonts that look good together.</p><h2>Structure</h2><p>The top of your CV should contain your name, email address and phone number. A short, one-sentence objective summary can be helpful, but usually isn't necessary. <strong>Do not include:</strong> photos of yourself, your address, or "star" ratings of your skills. The first two aren't relevant, take up a lot valuable space, and even open you up to discrimination based on your appearance. "Star" ratings of your skills are <a href="https://workplace.stackexchange.com/a/75700">extremely subjective, and essentially meaningless</a>. Anything less than 4 stars is essentially calling attention to your weaknesses - why bother? Use your bullet points to explain the amazing things …</p></div></div>

					<p><span>As an engineering team lead at a software company it’s my responsibility to fence distractions and make sure my developers are focused on the goals of the sprint. Too much noise from the business or tools can cause interruptions in our workflows and defocus the team from our priorities. Slack alerts are one of those distractions that can become too noisy very quickly. Whether it’s Jira, Github, Docker or LinearB, I am constantly analyzing which Slack alerts are actually useful to my team. Here is what I’ve learned.&nbsp; </span></p>

Is it possible to replicate the success of deployment alerts, in the development process phase? </span></p>

Now that everyone is distributed, it can be even more challenging to identify stuck work in our development process, or know when I’m not interrupting anyone. Slack alerts are an easy asynchronous way to communicate when something needs attention without someone having to personally reach out, or wait until the next stand up — which could be 20 hours away.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The other major pros to asynchronous stuck work slack alerts are using them to balance teamwork and drive discussions. Asking someone to drop what they are doing to follow-up on your request is bad form. An alert however can be read when someone is taking a break and picked up by whoever has time.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>These alerts also provide an opportunity to have a focused Slack or Zoom discussion that may not have been otherwise had. Giving developers the chance to provide context around the alert is an easy way to make sure your devs are being heard, as well as learn how you can best support your teammates.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>JAMStack or JavaScript, APIs and Markup Stack is a modern shift in the FrontEnd Space to develop fast web applications.</p><p>JAMStack has been around for a while, though recent developments in SSG (Static Site Generators) has pushed JAM Stack to be one of the favourite Stack Choice.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-jamstack">What is JAMStack?</h2><p>JAMStack is a stack (duh), workflow and way to build websites where dynamic behaviour is provided by <strong><u>J</u>avaScript</strong>, Data is fed only via <strong><u>A</u>PIs</strong> and <strong><u>M</u>arkup</strong> provides the necessary structure/placeholder for the content which is static or dynamic.</p><blockquote><strong>The main idea is that the Static Markup will always be faster than the dynamically generated markup from Server</strong></blockquote><p>So we will serve the static content at first and use JavaScript to add dynamic content through API.</p><p>One very common sidestep is SSR, Server Side Rendering, where for the Dynamic Content, we generate the Static Pages beforehand and deploy them. When a Client request for the Page, we will deliver the static content and Data to re-link the page's JavaScript with Markup.</p><p>The final render will be non-noticeable change from SSR HTML to JavaScript Generated Components.</p><p>And if the JS Renderer is intelligent enough, there will not be any change to the DOM itself. Many Front End Libraries and Frameworks are doing so with the help of Virtual DOM (vDOM) and applying only the diff of vDOM &amp; actual DOM.</p><h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3><ul><li><strong>Ultra Fast</strong>; as content generation step is removed, so is the time to do so. The requested pages can be delivered as soon as the server finds the content to deliver.</li><li><strong>Low Server Cost</strong>; Server Cost is low as we not spending Server time and resources on building the markup dynamically.</li><li><strong>Backends For Frontend (BFF)</strong>; Now backend can only focus on serving the needs of the front end with APIs rather than spending energy on caring about the response markup generation.<p>Hence Backend will only exist to satisfy FrontEnd needs. This also means Backend Teams can focus on solving problems at the API level.</p><p>Serving static content is gonna be primarily handled at DevOps level.</p></li><li><strong>Better Caching</strong>; As the static content is less likely to change, the caching can be more extensive to speed up the Content Delivery. The age of cached content can be longer.</li><li><strong>Leverage CDN</strong>; CDN (Content Delivery Networks) can be leveraged to deliver the static markup as well; not just the media files</li></ul><h3 id="problems">Problems</h3><p>As there are shiny benefits; there are some problems as well that need to be addressed when choosing to go with JAM stack. Problems like:</p><ul><li><strong>TTI or Time to Interactive</strong>; Longer <a href="https://web.dev/tti/">TTI</a>s can be a huge pain if the JS is not performant or not bundled in an optimized way</li><li><strong>Optimization is at Discretion</strong>; The JavaScript and CSS delivery need to be optimized and there are tools to do this automatically but Developers' discretion is heavily required.</li><li><strong>JS Parsing Overhead</strong>; As all the dynamicity is moved to JS, User would have to wait for JS make the page functional and ready to use and parsing time of JS is another bottleneck.<p>Hence JS delivered to clients should be optimized, small in size and should only contain the pieces which will be needed immediately.</p></li><li><strong>SEO</strong>; SEO is not a big problem as the Crawlers can execute the necessary JS; though it is an extra step for crawlers to execute. SSR and HTML Snapshots can fix this problem but this is an extra step for the build of the site.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care?</h2><p>As a developer, no matter which part of Application you are working on, you have to be aware of the Stack you are using or you are going to use.</p><h3 id="as-frontend-developer">As Frontend Developer</h3><p>As a frontend developer, JAM stack brings a majority of the application responsibilities to you. You might need to be aware of the DevOps of the application as well</p><h3 id="as-backend-developer">As Backend Developer</h3><p>As we discussed above, JAM stack promotes BFF (Backend For Frontend) for application development.</p><p>This means that API hardening is much more essential. Security, Access, Authorization etc becomes highly important.</p><p>The backend can be developed as a monolith or microservice, but this detail of implementation is none of the Frontend's concern. It up to you how you break the application down and when you do it.</p><h3 id="as-fullstack-developer">As Fullstack Developer</h3><p>Well, everything written above for Frontend and Backend is your concern now. You might also have to be more aware of System Architecture and DevOps for smooth development and execution of the application.</p><p>As the idea of DevOps as code is being favoured more and more by developers and DevOps engineers; you are kind of a One-Man Army in JAM Stack.</p><hr><h2 id="when-to-say-no-to-jamstack">When to say "<em>No!"</em> to JAMStack?</h2><p>No matter how shiny it is, sometimes JAM stack is an over-engineering practice as a solution to application design.</p><p>You can try to ask yourself the following questions to see if JAMStack is a right fit for your application design:</p><ul><li>How important it is to have an ultra-fast web application</li><li>Does your team have independent Frontend and Backend Developer?</li><li>How often the dynamic part of your application changes?</li></ul><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/time2hack/image/upload/q_auto:good,f_auto/what-is-jam-stack-why-you-should-care-Comparision.png" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Can you spend on multiple servers and CDN service? And how much?</li><li>and many more...</li></ul><hr><h2 id="how-to-jamstack">How to <em>"JAMStack"</em>?</h2><p>Like we discussed in the beginning, JAMStack has three major parts</p><ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>APIs</li><li>Markup</li></ul><p>Markup is always HTML and JavaScript is always going to be there to add interactivity to HTML.</p><p>APIs are a whole different challenge in themselves; though for JAMStack; let's consider that the APIs are in place and follow the majority of the best practices.</p><p>Now the question is about the tools and development workflow.</p><p>Major tools can be put in the brackets of:</p><h3 id="ssg-static-site-generators-">SSG (Static Site Generators)</h3><p>SSGs are the tools responsible for the generation of Static Page and that's where the name comes from. Some commonly used Generators are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a></li><li><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-static/react-static">React Static</a></li><li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a></li><li><a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a></li><li><a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a></li><li>More generators at <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">https://www.staticgen.com/</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="build-and-deployment">Build and Deployment</h3><p>Build and Deployment sections are also known as CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment). This is where above-mentioned SSGs will execute and generate the Pages and publish them to the designated host.</p><p>You can find a guide to <a href="https://www.time2hack.com/host-your-static-site-on-gitlab-pages/">host your static site for free here</a> and <a href="https://www.time2hack.com/ways-to-host-single-page-application-spa-static-site-for-free/">here</a></p><p>Popular CI/CD Tools in the market you can choose from:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li><li><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel (now.sh)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a></li><li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/">Gitlab CI/CD</a></li><li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">BitBucket pipelines</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="cms-content-management-system-">CMS (Content Management System)</h3><p>CMSes are the place where we will manage the Content. This is not necessary for all the JAM Stack Sites, though the sites where API is for content, choice of CMS is a crucial part.</p><p>For CMSes to play well with the JAM Stack, they should be able to execute in a Headless Manner. Some of the popular choices are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a></li><li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a></li><li><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a></li><li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress (Headless Mode)</a></li><li>More headless CMSes at <a href="https://headlesscms.org/">https://headlesscms.org/</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>JAMStack is very fast when done properly. And there are so many choices to make to build a fast solution with JAMStack.</p><p><strong><em>What is your JAMStack?</em></strong></p><p>Let me know through comments 💬 or on Twitter at &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/patel_pankaj_">@patel_pankaj_</a> &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/time2hack">@time2hack</a></p><p>If you find this article helpful, please share it with others 🗣</p><p>Subscribe to the blog to receive new posts right to your inbox.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10501"><div><div><div><h2>‘Incognito Mode’ does not mean ‘invisible’ says Google as it asks San Jose judge to dismiss the lawsuit alleging Chrome Incognito Mode privacy breach</h2><p>Google wants the San Jose Judge to trash a privacy lawsuit that alleged that the search giant was collecting data of users even though they used Google’s <a href="https://androidrookies.com/websites-can-still-detect-if-you-use-incognito-mode-in-chrome-despite-googles-promise-to-fix-it/">Chrome browser’s Incognito Mode</a>. The potential class-action lawsuit was filed in June by California residents Chasom Brown and Maria Nguyen and Florida resident William Byatt against Google LLC and it’s parent Alphabet Inc. for collecting user’s information even though they were using the Chrome browser Incognito Mode.</p><p>Brown &amp; Co. allege that they were tracked by Google, despite using the Chrome browser’s incognito mode to visit sites including CNN.com, Apartments.com, and NYTimes.com.&nbsp;They cited that the Google Analytics and Google Ad Manager results show the users Google’s collection of IP addresses, browser and device information, and web pages’ content even if the user is using Incognito Mode in Chrome Browser.</p><p>The lawsuit claimed that according to Google Privacy Policy and Disclosures misdirect users into thinking that using Incognito Mode makes their web session private. The plaintiffs allege that when Chrome users command the browser to open an incognito window, they are greeted with a message stating that Chrome won’t save browsing history, cookies and site data, and information entered in forms. But the message also tells users their activity may be “visible” to websites they visit. The lawsuit further alleges that this data can be used for “device fingerprinting.”</p><p>Device fingerprinting aka canvas fingerprinting, browser fingerprinting, and machine fingerprinting is a process used to identify a device (or browser) based on its specific and unique configuration. Unlike web cookies that are stored client-side (i.e. on a user’s device), device fingerprints need to be stored server-side — i.e. in a database. It is a very controversial tracking technique that doesn’t rely on cookies but can reveal users’ private information.</p><h2>Google wants the Judge to kick out the Chrome incognito mode privacy lawsuit</h2><p>Google’s lawyers want the federal judge to throw out a lawsuit.&nbsp;“This is not a case where Google received data surreptitiously, much less deceitfully,” Google argues in papers filed Thursday with U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose. Google’s lawyers said that the lawsuit&nbsp;“is predicated on a willful misreading of Google’s disclosures.”</p><p>The Google’s lawyers urged Judge Koh to dismiss the lawsuit for several reasons. Google says that it’s privacy policy and disclosures tell the users that <a href="https://androidrookies.com/websites-can-still-detect-if-you-use-incognito-mode-in-chrome-despite-googles-promise-to-fix-it/">Chrome’s incognito mode</a> only prevents data from being stored on their devices and not as stated by the plaintiffs.</p><p>“Incognito mode prevents previously-set cookies on the browser from being shared with the websites visited, in order to make the device appear as a new user,” Google reply to the lawsuit states. “’Incognito” does not mean “invisible,’ however, and the fact that some unidentified users visited websites and reviewed certain pages is not hidden from the websites themselves, or from any third-party analytics or ads services they use.”</p><p>In simple words using your Chrome browser’s incognito mode doesn’t guarantee you privacy as per Google privacy policy and disclosures. Google is already facing another <a href="https://androidrookies.com/google-accused-of-recording-chrome-users-personal-data-regardless-of-user-consent/">privacy lawsuit</a> for collecting users’ information consent through its Android Lockbox.</p><p><a href="https://www.classaction.org/media/brown-et-al-v-google-llc-et-al.pdf">Brown et al. v. Google LLC et al. – 5:20-cv-03664(PDF)</a> – ClassAction lawsuit is being heard by Lucy Koh in San Jose Federal Court.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter those keywords in search to find whether they …</p></div></div>

<p>Jobs to be done (JTBD) are <em>the mechanisms&nbsp;that cause a consumer to adopt an innovation.</em> </p>



<p><strong>But when people hear the name, they think it’s a smart-sounding way of saying “task” or “todo”.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s first talk about what JTBD really means. A good JTBD has 3 characteristics:</p>



<ol><li>It is solution-agnostic</li><li>It results in personal progress</li><li>It’s&nbsp;stable-ish over time</li></ol>



<p>For example, if John buys a grill, his JTBD is <em>not</em> that he wants to grill some burgers. Grilling burgers doesn’t satisfy any of those 3 criteria.</p>



<ol><li>It’s not solution agnostic. There are only a few ways to grill burgers.</li><li>It doesn’t result in personal progress when completed. He hasn’t progressed as a person, because he now has burgers.</li><li>It isn’t stable over time. Once he’s made the burgers, he’s done with his urge to make burgers for a while.</li></ol>



<p>Maybe John bought the grill because he <em>wants to be a better entertainer for his friends</em>. That’s a better example of a JTBD.</p>



<ol><li>It’s solution agnostic. There are countless ways to become a better entertainer. </li><li>It results in personal progress. Being a better entertainer means he progressed as a person.</li><li>It’s stable over time. When he buys the grill, he doesn’t stop wanting to be a good entertainer. That JTBD lives on.</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>So let’s rename Jobs To Be Done, just for fun. Here are my suggestions:</p>



<ol><li>Emotional Betterments</li><li>Life Improvements To Be Had (LITBH, super catchy)</li><li>Customer Progress Desires</li><li>Progression Stories (because “story” is trendy)</li><li>Consumer Personal Enhancement</li><li>Personal Gain Opportunity (PGO, is that an airport?)</li></ol>



<p>Even something vague and cool sounding like “Tablesaws” or “Wind Whistles” would be better, because at least that wouldn’t give people the wrong idea.</p>



<p>How would you rename JTBD? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me and let me know</a>.</p>

It makes sense, why limit your candidate pool? “Good developers should be able to pick up the small differences across languages quickly, their algorithm knowledge and experience is what we are looking for” they might say. I recently went from being a language agnostic hiring manager, to language agnostic candidate, to language agnostic hiree, to novice Python developer. It was a very interesting process and I have some insights I’d like to share from each part of the journey.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12000/1*mbZ4d3IzTmi46SzfihlJqw.jpeg" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*mbZ4d3IzTmi46SzfihlJqw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*mbZ4d3IzTmi46SzfihlJqw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*mbZ4d3IzTmi46SzfihlJqw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*mbZ4d3IzTmi46SzfihlJqw.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*mbZ4d3IzTmi46SzfihlJqw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Change is beautiful and inevitable</figcaption></figure><p id="3fe2">In my last role I was heavily involved in the hiring process. I was at a Clojure shop, a small but growing Lisp dialect that compiles to the JVM. Since developers that had ever heard of Clojure, let alone written production code, were difficult to find, we looked for strong developers with any language background. We were also writing ClojureScript on the frontend, so even JavaScript developers were starting from scratch.</p><p id="0499">During an interview, after we worked through whatever modeling or algorithm problem I had given them, I made sure to note ways the problem could have been done if we were using Clojure. There were three different types of reactions to my notes. Some candidates would nod or say that’s interesting. Others would challenge the approach or defend why their native language does it the way it does. The final group would ask more about the features and decisions of Clojure, or even extrapolate ways some features could be used in other problems. I liked these candidates the most, of course.</p><p id="5423">What is probably clear is that the knowledge the candidates had previously was probably one of the worst indicators of how successful they would be writing Clojure code. The most successful developers would embrace the Clojure mindset and dig into its features and idiosyncrasies. Developers that had a harder time migrating, would constantly be thinking about a problem in their native language, then attempt to translate that solution into Clojure.</p><p id="e3a6">This is a fault that got me as well. When I was first learning Django, the ORM was a mystery to me. I would want to do seemingly simple queries that I could write easily in SQL but could not figure out for the life of me, how to do it with the ORM. I thought, easy, I’ll write the SQL query first, then convert it to an ORM query. I found a guide on<a href="https://amitness.com/2018/10/django-orm-for-sql-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> SQL to ORM translations</a>, but it didn’t help. I needed to embrace the ORM mindset. I had to start thinking in the way of the ORM, not translating SQL queries. Once I embraced the ORM, it was a powerful tool that could help me quickly explore data and write more optimized queries.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4480/1*70jocMRU4kpS5nZ9zuft6g.jpeg" width="2240" height="1488" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*70jocMRU4kpS5nZ9zuft6g.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*70jocMRU4kpS5nZ9zuft6g.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*70jocMRU4kpS5nZ9zuft6g.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*70jocMRU4kpS5nZ9zuft6g.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*70jocMRU4kpS5nZ9zuft6g.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Know who you are</figcaption></figure><p id="d51e">Tooling is another decision to make when embracing a new stack. Do you stick with what you know or take on the tools that are more common for a given language. I was most familiar with IntelliJ as my main IDE. Luckily, Jetbrains also makes PyCharm, a popular Python IDE. I decided to stick with IntelliJ, and a lot of features are identical across the two environments. I was also learning a lot of other tooling, so being at home in my IDE was important. Other tooling and environment changes included: AWS -&gt; GCP, OS X -&gt; Ubuntu, and Sequel Pro -&gt; pgAdmin III. Each of these had their own struggles.</p><p id="5c59">Some of these choices will be made for you. Sequel Pro is OS X only and doesn’t support PostgreSQL. I was forced to move to a new client. A lot of the other developers would use CLI clients, something I’ve never been a fan of. I was happy to embrace new tools, but losing some of my identity as a developer that uses GUIs seemed too far. Luckily I was able to find pgAdmin which allowed for very similar functionality to Sequel Pro. I even started using a few features that don’t exist in Sequel Pro, like scratch pad, since I was open to discovering everything the new tool had to offer.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10944/1*w7DvYT6j09CmrnSbRHLEVQ.jpeg" width="5472" height="3648" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*w7DvYT6j09CmrnSbRHLEVQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*w7DvYT6j09CmrnSbRHLEVQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*w7DvYT6j09CmrnSbRHLEVQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*w7DvYT6j09CmrnSbRHLEVQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*w7DvYT6j09CmrnSbRHLEVQ.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Some things can not be changed</figcaption></figure><p id="0a44">When learning a new code base, it’s important to understand the decisions that were made when designing it. What was top of mind when different models were created. What mistakes had already been made and what refactors had the code already gone through. Another important aspect to know is what are the future plans for the code base. What areas of the application still need to be refactored? What technologies need to be implemented before we can build a certain feature? Most of these questions can’t be answered by the code itself, it can’t be found on StackOverflow questions or even in library documentation. This information lives in the minds of the developers that built and maintained the code base, and if you are really lucky, the documentation they’ve written about their choices.</p><p id="7c46">During my first few months at Remesh I would be really excited to put up a PR for a medium-sized feature I’d been working on. I’d ask for reviews then see comments and change requests come pouring in. I’m not going to lie, a lot of those early code reviews were rough. Not because I was doing things wrong, sometimes I was, but because I wasn’t aware of a lot of the decisions that had already been made. I didn’t know about conventions that other developers were rightfully trying to follow, to make the codebase more cohesive and easier to comprehend.</p><p id="c731">Some of these changes were small, but others required large rewrites. Had I run my proposed implementation past a few engineers before starting to code, they probably would have brought up ways it wouldn’t fit with the companies coding styles. Doing a quick review beforehand would have saved me a ton of time after the fact. That’s why I pushed hard to implement a formal review process at Remesh, to save other developers from the problems I faced.</p><p id="0ac1">Design reviews are a great way to document all of these choices and make sure they coincide with decisions other developers are making. Our design review structure is pretty simple. A quick summary of the problem you are trying to solve, followed by a list of any solutions you considered and the solution you hope to implement.</p><p id="26d6"><strong>This format has a few benefits:</strong></p><p id="510f">Comparing trade-offs better frames the problem. Reviewers are able to quickly see the proposed solution and comment on why they prefer one solution over another. Seeing solutions the designer didn’t choose can give better insight on what problem the designer is trying to solve. Often the real problem is discovered by the solution that is chosen, or why a seemingly simple problem has such a complex solution.</p><p id="253a">Design reviews are overhead. Though they can drastically increase performance by preventing poor designs that need to be drastically refactored, it is a lot of work writing documentation that may only be reviewed quickly by peers. Listing the nitty details of how the implementation will work can be an unnecessary step. A lot of times these kinds of decisions are better communicated as code. What was considered? Why don’t certain solutions work well? How is this problem different from the other problems that seem similar to this problem? These are the types of questions a design review should be answering.</p><p id="6bb6">It creates clear patterns for the future. There are many ways to skin a cat, good engineering organizations solve problems in similar ways so they can easily be understood by and communicated to, the rest of the organization. This allows multiple developers to work on many parts of the codebase, knowing it will be familiar and follow certain patterns. Design reviews help limit the number of patterns. Unless a problem truly requires a unique solution, we prefer to use a pattern we have used before. Design reviews document these patterns and provide a good list of patterns to choose from.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

  <p><img src="https://www.ixthus.co.uk/images/uploadpics/Euro%20XPD%20D-Shaft.jpg" alt="What is Hall Effect?">
  </p><p> <strong>Hall Effect is a type of position sensing technology which uses magnetic fields to determine the position of an object.</strong></p><p>Hall Effect is the most popular type of measuring using a
magnetic field and are very popular with various industries.</p>

<p>We have a range of <a href="https://www.ixthus.co.uk/test-and-measurement-sensors/detail.php?sid=2&amp;did=Non-Contacting-Rotary-Position-Sensors" target="_blank"><b>Hall Effect sensors</b></a> in our portfolio
which offer programmable angles and are available in different sizes
</p>
<h2><u>What is Hall Effect?</u>
</h2>
<p>Hall Effect is the technology inside the sensor. It was
discovered in 1879 by Edwin Hall – an American physicist. The discovery was so
far ahead of it’s time that there was no use for it until decades later when
technology had moved further along and people had a wider understanding of
semiconducting and materials. </p>
<p>Hall Effect Sensors consist of a piece of semiconductor
material attached to a circuit causing a current to flow through it. When this
is placed on a magnetic field, the magnetic flux will exert a force onto the
semiconductor which then deflects charge carriers and electrons forcing them to
one side of the semiconductor and the positive charge will be forced to the
opposite side of the semiconductor. As the electrons are forced to the sides,
they produce voltage between to two sides of the semiconductor perpendicular to
the flow of current. This is called the Hall Effect. The size of the voltage
can be measured and an accurate reading can give position of an object. </p>
<p>In a Hall Effect sensor the magnet causing the magnetic
field disturbance is attached to an object which is moving. As the object
moves, the magnet moves, altering the magnetic field, which disturbs the
electrons which gives a voltage reading. The change in the voltage will be used
to determine the position of the object connected to the magnet. </p>
<p>In a rotary Hall Effect sensor the magnets are mounted in an
“x” format to provide continuous rotation. &nbsp;
</p>
<h2><u>Advantages of Hall Effect Sensors</u>
</h2>
<p>The main advantage of Hall effect sensors and the reason
they are so popular is that there are no wearing parts within the technology,
they are completely non-contacting (or non touching) this gives the technology
infinite life. </p>
<p>Other advantages of using Hall effect sensors are;</p>

<p>In April 2012, three college juniors — Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla — waited anxiously on the campus of Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. For the previous six months, their lives had been consumed by the pursuit of a single, radical idea: frustrated that women, year after year, were barred from the annual Gamers’ Day convention, <a href="http://gamersday.com/en/about-us.php#:~:text=Gamers'%20Day%20is%20a%20gaming,numbers%20of%20visitors%20and%20exhibitors">the largest annual gaming convention in Saudi Arabia</a>, they had decided to launch the first-ever gamers’ convention for women in the kingdom. As the organizers hurried around counting consoles and hanging posters near stalls, they wondered whether anyone would show up.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia’s gaming scene has dramatically evolved, especially for women. In the early 2000s, the country had strict moral regulations on entertainment, and games were mostly sold in a gray market or through unofficial channels. Areej, a 23-year-old university graduate, picked up her interest in gaming from her father, who once frequented the informal neighborhood stores that sold pirated copies of popular games for 10 riyals ($2). “He played Japanese and English games, even though he didn’t even understand English back then,” she recalled. “He would keep dictionaries around while playing. That’s actually how he learned the language.” Areej hopes to become a “localizer,” a job that entails translating English-language games into Arabic. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Sony’s 2007 release of the PlayStation 3 in the kingdom, the gaming industry began to take shape in Saudi Arabia. The first <a href="https://www.gamersday.com/en/">Gamers’ Day</a> took place in 2008, and it now draws upward of 60,000 male visitors over the course of four days. The convention presents video game companies with a lucrative opportunity to demo their latest equipment and products; devoted players, in turn, get to try out highly anticipated games that have not yet been released. In 2012, as the three girls were setting up Girls Con (or GCON as it would come to be known), the industry was estimated to have a global revenue stream of $70 billion.</p>



<p>In the months prior to GCON, Tasnim, the only one in the group with work experience, took the lead pitching sponsorship proposals to the all-male staffs at Nintendo and PlayStation Arabia. Without any real data on female gamers in the Middle East, and with barely any on girl gamers in North America, she had pitched on the assumption that the <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/male-and-female-gamers-how-their-similarities-and-differences-shape-the-games-market/">gender ratio for gamers in Saudi Arabia</a> was likely the same as in the United States: 47%. But there was no way to prove this. Until then, the world of female gaming in Saudi Arabia was a private one, usually set in the intimacy of people’s bedrooms.</p>



<p>“You could find girls who played video games, just for fun or on their mobile phone, but I had no idea how many girls were into hardcore gaming,” Felwa said. While mobile games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush were popular — the Kingdom boasts a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/xe/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/GMCS-whitepaper.pdf">90% cell phone penetration rate</a> — Felwa was curious to see how many girls had grown up like her playing Tomb Raider, Tekken, and League of Legends.</p>



<p>When the hall flooded with nearly 3,000 women, some as young as 13 and others in their 50s, it was a shock. “I definitely did not expect moms to come,” Felwa said. Back then, it was mandatory for women to wear the traditional black abaya, and often a headscarf, while in public. It was only when the women walked through the doors into the all-female space that their abayas slipped off to reveal an array of cosplay costumes.</p>



<p>Inside the hallway, girls who were expected to behave discreetly at all times rushed around trying to play as many PlayStation- and Nintendo-sponsored games as they could. On one side of the hall, first-time cosplayers shared a rare opportunity to express their fandom. On the other, 150 people stood in a rowdy line waiting their turn in a Call of Duty tournament.</p>

<p><strong>While the Middle</strong> <strong>East</strong> represents only a small portion of the international gaming industry, it is a rapidly expanding market. In 2017, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council accounted for around $693 million of gaming revenue, most related to esports. By 2021, that number is expected to exceed <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/press-releases/2020/gcc-gaming-market.html">$821 million</a>, boosted in part by the pandemic-induced lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia expects to be at the forefront<strong> </strong>of that expansion. In a country where roughly 50% of the population is under 30, gaming has become an emblem for a generation of young Saudis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, Prince Faisal bin Bandar, a young member of the royal family raised on Atari consoles, set out to make Saudi Arabia the Middle East’s hub for the $160 billion gaming industry. Under his leadership, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://safeis.sa/">Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS)</a> aims for esports revenue to amount to 1% of the country’s GDP (approximately $22 billion) by 2030.</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia was a late arrival to esports, its male players have already made their mark. Since 2017, Prince Faisal and the federation have been scouting, coaching, and sending professional esports players to competitions across the world. Mossad Al-Dossary, then 18, made headlines in 2018 after <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/msdossary-triumphs-fifa-eworld-cup-grand-final-london">winning first place</a> at the FIFA eWorld Cup in London, taking home a $250,000 cash prize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Female gamers, however, are still finding their way. Women in Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla’s generation grew up under the watch of religious police, in a time when public spaces were segregated by gender. While women still do not have the same rights as men, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman<strong> </strong>has relaxed male-guardianship rules and mandatory dress codes and legalized certain forms of entertainment for women. “I still struggle to convey what Saudi Arabia was like at that time to those that haven’t had that experience,” Tess said. There were no theaters, and sports facilities for girls were limited, “So, mostly, we had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p>



<p>Raghad, 23, currently works for a mining company, but she dreams of becoming a voice actor for video games. Although she’s never lived anywhere but Saudi Arabia, she has a distinctly squeaky American accent — a curious trait she picked up from a fifth-grade teacher who had lived in the U.S. and a torrent of YouTube videos. She is considering taking voice-acting classes online, assuming she can find any, because she’s not allowed to travel abroad alone to study until after she’s married. It’s still common to meet women who come to gaming as a result of these kinds of restrictions, as Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla did years ago. This is why going to GCON can be such a powerful experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In 2018, Felwa,</strong> Tasnim, and Najla handed GCON over to Ghada Al-Moqbel, who attended her first GCON in 2013 at the age of 18. Now she leads Saudi Arabia’s women’s gaming community. This occurred right after bin Salman took control and began dismantling the country’s gender segregation. For Ghada and the wider community of female gamers, these changes forced them to decide whether they wanted to stay on the fringes of the gaming community or take a more central role. In 2018, GCON organizers met regularly to discuss whether there was still value in creating an exclusively female space for gaming.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Ghada, the answer was yes. While attitudes toward female gamers have improved, parts of Saudi society remain uncomfortable with this burgeoning culture. When GCON first launched, participants were criticized for indulging in supposedly immoral behavior, and social media accounts of female gamers were routinely hacked. Likewise, after the first Comic Con in Jeddah, in 2017, a<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%84_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%87?src=hashtag_click"> hashtag</a> accusing participants of being Satan worshippers flooded social media along with pictures of women who had dressed up for cosplay. Thanks in part to the continuing fear of societal backlash, many Saudi women still advocate for all-female events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But like the kingdom, GCON is also evolving. “We’re not just entertainment anymore,” Ghada said. “It’s about empowering and enabling women to be serious in the gaming and esports industry.” In mid-August, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, the largest women-only university in the world, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1718151/saudi-arabia">announced</a> that it would be creating a degree program for animation.</p>



<p>Since Ghada took over, the organization has expanded, hosting regular skill-development workshops as well as the annual convention. While she has maintained GCON’s focus on female gamers, she has been open to collaborating with their male peers. In 2017, organizers from Gamer’s Day worked with GCON to arrange their first mixed-gender gaming event. While 2020 was supposed to be a big year for Ghada and GCON, Covid-19 disrupted their plans. Nonetheless, it’s unlikely that GCON — a force that arose in far more challenging terrain — will be going away anytime soon.</p>

    <!--end post header-->
    <div>
                <p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a widely used language for data science, but due to performance most of its underlying library are written in C, C++, or Fortran. <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> is a relative newcomer to the field which has busted out since its 1.0 to become <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2020">one of the top 20 most used languages</a> due to its high performance libraries for scientific computing and machine learning. Julia's value proposition has been its high performance in high level language, known as solving the two language problem, which has allowed allowed the language to build <a href="https://juliahub.com/ui/Home">a robust, mature, and expansive package ecosystem</a>. While this has been a major strength for package developers, the fact remains that there are still large and robust communities in other high level languages like R and Python. Instead of spawning distracting language wars, we should ask the question: can Julia become a language of libraries to accelerate these other languages as well?</p>
<p>This is definitely not the first time this question was asked. The statistics libraries in Julia were developed by individuals like <a href="http://128.105.7.173/~bates/">Douglas Bates who built some of R's most widely used packages like lme4 and Matrix</a>. Doug had <a href="https://rpubs.com/dmbates/377897">written a blog post in 2018 showing how to get top notch performance in linear mixed effects model fitting via JuliaCall</a>. In 2018 the JuliaDiffEq organization had <a href="https://sciml.ai/news/2018/04/30/Jupyter/"> written a blog post demonstrating the use of DifferentialEquations.jl in R and Python (the Jupyter of Diffrential Equations)</a>. Now rebranded as <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a> for <a href="https://sciml.ai/roadmap/">Scientific Machine Learning</a>, we looked to expand our mission and bring <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385">automated model discovery and acceleration</a> include other languages like R and Python with Julia as the base.</p>
<p>With the release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffeqr/index.html">diffeqr</a> v1.0, we can now demonstrate many advances in R through the connection to Julia. Specifically, I would like to use this blog post to showcase:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new direct wrapping interface of diffeqr</li>
<li>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R using Julia and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a></li>
<li>GPU-accelerated simulations of ensembles using Julia's <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Together we will demonstrate how models in R can be accelerated by 1000x without a user ever having to write anything but R.</p>
<h2>A Quick Note Before Continuing</h2>
<p>Before continuing on with showing all of the features, I wanted to ask for support so that we can continue developing these bridged libraries. Specifically, I would like to be able to support developers interested in providing a fully automated Julia installation and static compilation so that calling into Julia libraries is just as easy as any Rcpp library. To show support, the easiest thing to do is to star our libraries. The work of this blog post is build on <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/diffeqr">diffeqr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a>. Thank you for your patience and now back to our regularly scheduled program.</p>
<h2>diffeqr v1.0: Direct wrappers for Differential Equation Solving in R</h2>
<p>First let me start with the new direct wrappers of differential equations solvers in R. In the previous iterations of diffeqr, we had relied on specifically designed high level functions, like "ode_solve", to compensate for the fact that one could not directly use Julia's original DifferentialEquations.jl interface directly from R. However, the new diffeqr v1.0 directly exposes the entirety of the Julia library in an easy to use framework.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, let's see how to define the Lorenz ODE with diffeqr. In Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl, we would start by defining an "ODEProblem" that contains the initial condition u0, the time span, the parameters, and the f in terms of `u' = f(u,p,t)` that defines the derivative. In Julia, this would look like:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><span>using</span> DifferentialEquations
<span>function</span> lorenz<span>(</span>du,u,p,t<span>)</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> = p<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>(</span>u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>-u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> = u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>(</span>p<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>-u<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> - u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> = u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> - p<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>u<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>
u0 = <span>[</span><span>1.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>,<span>1.0</span><span>]</span>
tspan = <span>(</span><span>0.0</span>,<span>100.0</span><span>)</span>
p = <span>[</span><span>10.0</span>,<span>28.0</span>,<span>8</span>/<span>3</span><span>]</span>
prob = ODEProblem<span>(</span>lorenz,u0,tspan,p<span>)</span>
sol = solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>With the new diffeqr, diffeq_setup() is a function that does a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It instantiates a Julia process to utilize as its underlying compute engine</li>
<li>It first checks if the correct Julia libraries are installed and, if not, it installs them for you</li>
<li>Then it exposes all of the functions of DifferentialEquations.jl into its object</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that the following is the complete diffeqr v1.0 code for solving the Lorenz equation is:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
f &lt;- function(u,p,t) {
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  return(c(du1,du2,du3))
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol &lt;- de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>This then carries on through SDEs, DDEs, DAEs, and more. Through this direct exposing form, the whole library of DifferentialEquations.jl is at the finger tips of any R user, making it a truly cross-language platform.</p>
<p>(Note that the only caveat is that diffeq_setup requires that the user has already installed Julia and julia is included in the path. We hope that future developments can eliminate this need.)</p>
<h2>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R via ModelingToolkit.jl</h2>
<p>The reason for Julia is speed (well and other things, but here, SPEED!). Using the pure Julia library, we can solve the Lorenz equation 100 times in about 0.05 seconds:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>@<span>time</span> <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>1</span>:<span>100</span> solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span> <span>end</span>
<span>0.048237</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048231</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>

<p>Using diffeqr connected version, we get:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;

<p>That's not good, that's about 100x difference! In <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/why-numba-and-cython-are-not-substitutes-for-julia/">this blog post I described that interpreter overhead and context switching</a> are the main causes of this issue. We've also demonstrated that <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/cc6ac746e2dfd285c28e0584a2bfd320">ML accelerators like</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/6a03e7b151c86b32d74b41af54d495c6">PyTorch</a> generally do not perform well in this regime since those kinds of accelerators rely on heavy array operations, unlike the scalarized nonlinear interactions seen in a lot of differential equation modeling. For this reason we cannot just slap any old JIT compiler onto the f call and then put it into the function since there would still be left over. So we need to do something a bit tricky.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkXNZZ3hSw">JuliaCon 2020 talk, Automated Optimization and Parallelism in DifferentialEquations.jl</a> I demonstrated how <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a> can be used to trace functions and generate <a href="https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/tutorials/auto_parallel/">highly optimized sparse and parallel code</a> for scientific computing all in an automated fashion. It turns out that JuliaCall can do a form of tracing on R functions, something that exploited to allow <a href="https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/autodiffr">autodiffr to automatically differentiate R code with Julia's AD libraries</a>. Thus it turns out that the same <a href="https://github.com/SciML/AutoOptimize.jl">modelingtoolkitization methods used in AutoOptimize.jl</a> can be used on a subset of R codes which includes a large majority of differential equation models.</p>
<p>In short, we can perform automated acceleration of R code by turning it into sparse parallel Julia code. This was exposed in diffeqr v1.0 as the `jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)` function (also `jitoptimize_sde(de,prob)`). Let's try it out on this example. All you need to do is give it the ODEProblem which you wish to accelerate. Let's take the last problem and turn it into a pure Julia defined problem and then time it:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
fast_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(fastprob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.05    0.00    0.04
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>And there you go, an R user can get the full benefits of Julia's optimizing JIT compiler without having to write lick of Julia code! This function also did a few other things, like automatically defined the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/tutorials/advanced_ode_example/#Automatic-Sparsity-Detection">Jacobian code to make implicit solving of stiff ODEs much faster as well</a>, and it can perform sparsity detection and automatically optimize computations on that.</p>
<p>To see how much of an advance this is, note that this Lorenz equation is the same from the <a href="http://desolve.r-forge.r-project.org/">deSolve examples page</a>. So let's take their example and see how well it performs:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(deSolve)
Lorenz &lt;- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    dX &lt;-  a * X + Y * Z
    dY &lt;-  b * (Y - Z)
    dZ &lt;- -X * Y + c * Y - Z
    list(c(dX, dY, dZ))
  })
}
&nbsp;
parameters &lt;- c(a = -8/3, b = -10, c = 28)
state      &lt;- c(X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1)
times      &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 1.0)
out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
&nbsp;
desolve_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  state      &lt;- c(X = runif(1), Y = runif(1), Z = runif(1))
  parameters &lt;- c(a = -8/3 * runif(1), b = -10 * runif(1), c = 28 * runif(1))
  out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
}
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.03    0.03    5.07
&gt;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.42    0.00    5.44
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.41    0.00    5.41</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Thus we see 100x acceleration over the leading R library without users having to write anything but R code. This is the true promise in action of a "language of libraries" helping to extend all other high level languages!</p>
<h2>GPU-acceleration of ODEs in R via DiffEqGPU.jl</h2>
<p>Can we go deeper? Yes we can. In many cases like in <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/how-inexact-models-can-guide-decision-making-in-quantitative-systems-pharmacology/">optimization and sensitivity analysis of models for pharmacology</a> the users need to solve the same …</p></div></div></div>

			Researchers at the University of Hong Kong on Monday said they have proved that a Hong Kong man was infected with Covid-19 for a second time â€“ the worldâ€™s first such documented case. </p><p>

The 33-year-old IT worker was cleared of Covid-19 and discharged from a hospital in April. He tested positive for the virus again after returning from Spain earlier this month. </p><p>

Health officials at first were unsure if the man was a "persistent carrier" of the virus from his previous infection. </p><p>

But the HKU research team said genetic sequencing showed the virus strains contracted by him in April and August were â€œclearly differentâ€�. The study has been accepted by the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, the researchers said. </p><p>

â€œMany believe that recovered Covid-19 patients have immunity against re-infection because most developed a serum neutralising antibody response. However, there is evidence that some patients have waning antibody level after a few months," the researchers said.  </p><p>

â€œOur findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common cold-associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection,â€� they said. </p><p>

They said, therefore, patients who recovered after getting Covid-19 should also wear masks and maintain social distancing.</p><p>

"Since the immunity can be short-lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection," they said.		</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Happy birthday Windows 95. You introduced the world to the Start menu and so much more. Man, they grow up so fast. So today to celebrate this amazing occasion, we're going to time travel and take a look at the history and some of the features of one of the greatest OS releases in history.</p>
<p>Microsoft spent over $300 million on the marketing for Windows 95. It clearly paid off, so good for them. Part of this marketing effort was a commercial featuring the Rolling Stones "Start Me Up" song omitted for copyright reasons and lighting up the Empire State Building in the Windows' flag colors.</p>
<p>Then on August 24th, 1995, Microsoft held a launch party with Jay Leno, 500 journalists, 2,000 guests and 9,000 Microsoft employees. And of course Bill Gates himself. So with the marketing efforts and the hype building up when the launch officially happened, Microsoft sold 4 million copies slash licenses of Windows 95 in one day and in the first year 40 million. So now that we know that stuff, let's go back in time, even further, back to the beta days of Windows 95 with code name Chicago.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b49283db1.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b49283db1.webp"></p>
<p>One of the earliest builds of Windows 95 to leak was Windows Chicago build 58s. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b4a3ee175.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" width="854" height="480" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b4a3ee175.webp">And as you can see the task bar and the start menu were present, they were just very primitive. The file cabinet program was the replacement for the file manager we had in Windows 3 and in later builds the file cabinet became Windows Explorer, which we'll take a look at later. It's also worth noting that the minimize and maximize button started to take shape with the icons we're familiar with today, but the close button has not been implemented quite yet. To close a window, you could still use the menu in the upper left.</p>
<p>Next to the start menu, which wasn't officially labeled the start menu yet, there was a search feature and a help feature, which were eventually unified into the start menu in later builds. And the rest of the task bar wasn't fully fleshed out yet in this particular build. Today we're used to seeing running applications show up in the task bar, so we could easily switch between them. And while that feature was introduced in Windows 95, this particular build did not support that. And when you minimized windows, they wouldn't shrink into the task bar like we're used to, instead, they would transform into blocks that you could actually drag around the desktop.&nbsp;Oh, and in case you were wondering, the Dr. Watson program was the debugger for this particular beta system.</p>
<p>In a later build, running programs would appear in the task bar. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b4f6e127e.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" width="854" height="480" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b4f6e127e.webp">And later the start menu was actually labeled start. And the three buttons we saw earlier were combined into one simple menu. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b50845afa.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" width="854" height="480" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b50845afa.webp">And if you wanted to drag the task bar around, go nuts, put it wherever you want.</p>
<p>Build 189 was the first leaked build to be branded as Windows 95.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b516c76bc.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" width="854" height="480" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b516c76bc.webp"> Other Windows 95 branded builds likely existed, maybe even out in the public somewhere, but to the general public build 189 was the first well known beta version of Windows to actually call itself Windows 95. And by this time the visual details of the system are nearly complete, but the start menu still looked a bit different than in the retail release.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this particular build was compiled on September 21st, 1994 and Windows 95 didn't come out until August 24th, 1995. So we still had 11 months to go. And over that time, there were plenty of other beta builds and test releases compiled.</p>
<p>Let's hop into the 95 retail release and talk about some of its features. And my favorite thing about the Windows 95 release is so many of the features in it were kind of like the origin stories of features we still use today in Windows 10, let's take a look.</p>
<p>The biggest feature was the introduction of the start menu. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b55e8286f.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" width="854" height="480" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b55e8286f.webp">Documents and programs could be easily accessed from a simple menu instead of having to deal with the file manager and the program manager in the previous systems. The task bar was another new feature, something we'll use today all the time in Windows. And it allowed you to easily switch between open programs. And nowadays we use the stuff without even thinking about it. So we might take it for granted, but this was a pretty big deal back then.</p>
<p>Windows Explorer was also first introduced in Windows 95. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b57e9cd29.webp" alt="Why Windows 95 is AWESOME (History and Features)" width="854" height="480" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/08/5f43b57e9cd29.webp">And this file browser replaced the File Manager from previous systems, the Windows Explorer featured some new right-click shortcuts for power users, which included a Quick View feature, which will let you preview contents of a file without opening that file in a program. Also introduced for the first time was the, My Computer shortcut, which allowed users to see connected devices and information about their computer. For example, they could look at their printers and although the My Computer shortcut stuck around for a long time in Windows, we don't really use it or see it much more today, but I'll tell you what we do see still... the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>This feature was also introduced in Windows 95. If a user deletes a file, it would simply move to the Recycle Bin just in case they wanted to undelete the file later. And here's another big change something we probably still take for granted today, long file names. Previous to Windows 95, unless you were using certain Windows NT releases in the Windows' world you could only have file names with eight characters before the file extension. So you had to find creative ways to abbreviate your documents and everything. But with Windows 95, the character limit expanded to 255 characters. So good. That was pretty convenient.</p>
<p>And even though you didn't need to use DOS to start up Windows 95 anymore, like you had to with the previous Windows systems, you could still run DOS programs inside of Windows, either in full screen mode or in a window. So kudos to Microsoft for keeping that compatibility. I think that's something they do really well in the PC space. They seem to pay attention a lot to backward compatibility. But in addition to that Windows 95 also paved the way for 32-bit applications on Windows. In addition to Windows NT, which already had that. But in the more consumer space, Windows 95 helped push 32-bit apps out to users, which would potentially run much faster than their 16-bit counterparts.</p>
<p>And you probably already saw this, but the close minimize and maximize buttons are now present in the upper right of the windows, laid out in a very similar fashion to what we're used to today. And even though Internet Explorer wasn't initially bundled with Windows 95. It was available in Windows 95 with Microsoft Plus and in some other bundles, depending on where you bought your computer from. So this marked at the beginning of the Internet Explorer era, which lasted quite a long time, I mean, it's still used today, not a ton. It's starting to get phased out more, and we have a Microsoft Edge to replace it too. But man, still, kudos to you Internet Explorer, you lasted a very long time, maybe a little longer than you should have, but that's none of my business.</p>
<p>And I know I haven't covered all of the new features in Windows 95, but if I missed any that you really liked, feel free to let me know about those in the comments.</p>
<p>Some could argue that these Windows 95 features weren't anything new because other operating systems were already doing this stuff. Heck even the Macintosh had a trash feature in version one that was back in 1984, but most of the time that doesn't really matter. And Apple would even defend that. On the iPhone, they weren't the first with cut, copy, paste or with multitasking, but they still took their time to make it right. They did it well and people loved it, but they weren't the first and that's okay.</p>
<p>So even though some of these features did come into Windows a little bit later compared to other operating systems, it didn't matter because Microsoft was making their way into the homes of millions of people. And they were spreading around like wildfire. And with Windows 95, they just helped push the ease of use into the personal computing space even further.</p>
<p>Windows 95 wasn't perfect, no operating system is of course, but I think it should still be remembered as an imperative piece of personal computing history.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(l\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil l / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil l / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(l\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil l / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post

GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

      <p>Hard to imagine that it’s already been a year since Nu first went public. At the time, it was largely a demo of what could be possible, but still needed quite a bit of work to make it ready for everyday use. A year later and we’ve learned a lot, and made a few mistakes along the way. In this post, we look back over the year and see how we did and where we might be going in the future.</p>



<p>When Nu first started, it started with a simple idea: the output of <code>ls</code>, <code>ps</code>, and <code>sysinfo</code> should all output the same thing. Taking a page from PowerShell, we explored outputting structured data and quickly settled on a table design that would support the output of each of the three commands, with the added ability of streaming the output as it became available.</p>

<p>Around this idea, we then built a set of “filters”, like the <code>where</code> clause, borrowed from SQL, and a growing set of data types we would support natively.  Soon, we were able to write more complex statements like <code>ls | where size &gt; 10kb</code>. This became the crux of the idea - commands that output values from a core set of data types into a stream, composed together with the traditional UNIX pipe (<code>|</code>), so that you could build up a complex set of commands that work over the data as it streams through.</p>

<p>Nushell is an interactive programming language for working with your files, your system, and your data as a shell, a notebook, and more.</p>

<h2 id="nu-is-more-than-a-shell">Nu is more than a shell</h2>

<p>It’s easy to think of Nushell as just a shell. It’s even got ‘shell’ in the name. It’s the first and probably main way you’ll interact with it. So why say it’s “more than a shell”?</p>

<p>In truth, Nushell is actually two things at once: Nu and Nushell. Nu is an interactive language for processing streams of structured data, data that you’re probably getting from files, your system, a web address, etc.</p>

<p>So what’s Nushell?</p>

<p>Nushell is taking the Nu language and putting it into a shell, and building around it a set of shell features to make it feel comfortable to use as a login shell. Completions, pretty error messages, and the like.</p>

<p>When we say that “Nu is more than a shell”, does that imply that Nu can be used in other places, too? Absolutely. We’ve got two more hosts that let you run Nu, a <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nu_jupyter">jupyter-based</a> host that lets you run Nu in jupyter notebooks, and a <a href="https://github.com/nushell/demo">WebAssembly-based</a> host that we use to create the <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/demo/">Nu playground</a></p>

<p>The idea of Nu runs deeper than just the shell, to being a language that’s relatively easy to learn, yet powerful enough to do real work with your system, to process large amounts of data, to interactively let you iterate quickly on an idea, to invite exploration by building up a pipeline one piece at a time. There’s really no shortage of ambition for where we hope to go.</p>



<p>Nu’s original design has proven surprisingly robust thus far. Some of its core ideas are continuing to pay dividends a year later. Let’s look at the designs that still feel right.</p>

<h2 id="pipelines-are-infinite">Pipelines are infinite</h2>

<p>When we first started writing Nu, we took a few shortcuts that had us processing all the data in a pipeline at once. Very quickly, we realize this wasn’t going to work. External commands (think <code>cat /dev/random</code>) can output an infinite stream of data, and the system needs to be able to handle it. Understanding this, we transitioned to a different model: data flows between command as infinite streams of structured data. As the data is processed, we avoid collecting the data whenever possible to allow this streaming to happen.</p>

<p>Because the streams can be infinite, even the printing out of tables is done a batch at a time.</p>

<h2 id="separating-viewing-data-from-the-data-itself">Separating viewing data from the data itself</h2>

<p>Coming from other shells, the idea of running <code>echo</code> or <code>ls</code> goes hand-in-hand with printing something to the terminal. It’s difficult to see that there two steps going on behind the scenes: creating the information and then displaying it to the screen.</p>

<p>In Nu, these two steps are distinct. The <code>echo</code> command gets data ready to output into stream, but doesn’t do any work to print it to the screen. Likewise, <code>ls</code> gets ready to output a stream of file and directory entries, but doesn’t actually display this information.</p>

<p>That’s because both <code>echo</code> and <code>ls</code> are lazy commands. They’ll only do the work if the data is pulled from the stream. As a result, the step of viewing the data is separate from the step of creating it.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Nu converts a standalone <code>ls</code> to be the pipeline <code>ls | autoview</code>. The work of viewing comes from <code>autoview</code> and it handles working with the data and calling the proper viewer. In this way, we’re able to keep things as structured data for as long as possible, and only convert it to be displayed as the final step before being shown to the user. (note: the wasm-based demo and jupyter do a similar step, but instead of adding <code>autoview</code>, they add <code>to html</code>)</p>

<h2 id="rich-data-types">Rich data types</h2>

<p>In a similar way to working with structured data, rather than only plain text, Nu takes a different approach to data types as well. Nu takes the traditional set of basic types, like strings and numbers, and extends them into a richer set of basic data primitives.</p>

<p>Numbers are represented internally as big numbers and big decimals, rather than integers and floating point machine-based representations. This gives us more flexibility to do math more accurately, and generally removes the worry of whether the number you want to work with will fit in the integer or float size you have available.</p>

<p>We carry this further, by also representing values common in modern computer usage: URLs, file paths, file sizes, durations, and dates are all examples of built-in data types. By building them in, Nu can have better syntax and type checking with their use.</p>

<p>For example, in Nu it’s possible to write <code>= 1min + 1sec</code> to create a duration that is one minute one second long.  You can also use the file sizes, like being able to filter a directory list by the size of the file <code>ls | where size &gt; 10kb</code>.</p>

<p>Nu also can help if you try to mix types that shouldn’t. For example, if you had written: <code>= 1min + 1kb</code> it seems you didn’t mean to add time and file sizes together, and Nu gives you an error if you do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Coercion error
  ┌─ shell:1:3
  │
1 │ = 1min + 1kb
  │   ^^^^   --- filesize(in bytes)
  │   │       
  │   duration
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>note: we’ll be making this error better in the future</em></p>

<p>Data in Nu also isn’t just the value, but it’s also a set of metadata that comes with the value. For example, if you load data from a file using the <code>open</code> command, we track the place that it’s loaded along with the data that’s loaded. We can see this metadata using the <code>tags</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>open package.json | tags
───┬─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 # │      span       │                                    anchor                                    
───┼─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 0 │ [row end start] │ /home/jonathan/Source/servo/tests/wpt/web-platform-tests/webrtc/tools/packag 
   │                 │ e.json                                                                       
───┴─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This extra information allows us to know how to view the contents, and even save you time when you use the <code>save</code> command, as it will use the original location by default.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-fun">Keeping it fun</h2>

<p>Something we attached to early on was the idea that Nu should be fun. It should be fun to work on, it should be fun to contribute to, and it should be fun to use.</p>

<p>Nu is really about play. You play with your data, you play with the structures that make up your files and filesystem, you play with what web services give back to you. Everything about Nu is made to invite you to explore how things work and how data is put together. As you play, you learn more about Nu works and how to better use it. We firmly believe …</p></section></div></div>

					<div>
<p><span>When I was 10 years old and first introduced to the miracle of the World Wide Web, chat rooms were by far my favorite thing. Talking to random people from all over the world about anything you want — what more could a bored kid ask for?</span></p>

<p><span>I’d spend hours in these chat rooms, asking my new friends how old they were, what they had for breakfast, and how much pocket money their parents gave them. I shared this experience with a friend who didn’t own a computer and had never used the internet.</span></p>

<p><span>He asked if he could have a go. “Sure!” I said, excited for him to experience the wonder of the internet. Without hesitation, he began typing the worst insults and swear words he could think of. Horrified I had awoken a dark and malevolent force, and fearing he had forever ruined my friendship with strawberry88, I shut down my computer and didn’t invite him to play on the internet again.</span></p>

<p><span>To this day, I remain baffled by this behavior. When faced with the endless possibility of the internet, my childhood friend’s first impulse was to verbally abuse strangers. This innocent 10-year-old had become a troll.</span></p>

<h4 id="02ff"><span>Wretched impulses</span></h4>

<p><span>John Oliver once described the internet as a “dark carnival of humanity’s most wretched impulses.” Was it these wretched impulses that had consumed my childhood friend?</span></p>

<p><span>The act of trolling is best described from where its name&nbsp;<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/troll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have come from</a>&nbsp;— the form of fishing where a lure is dangled off a moving boat.</span></p>

<figure><span><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*f3HYZpvSGgrg1vHC" alt=""></span></figure>

<p><span>The troll casts his bait (the offensive comment) into the water of the internet. An unsuspecting fish (the targeted user) sees the bait and feels compelled to go for it (the defensive comment). Soon they are hooked and reeled in without mercy. But unlike trolling for fish, which delivers a clear and edible reward, the troll’s reward isn’t entirely clear.</span></p>

<p><span>Trolling is a hard concept to define because there are various methods of trolling and differing degrees of depravity. Some are abhorrent, like “suicide baiting,” where trolls encourage vulnerable users to kill themselves, or “RIP trolls” who vandalize Facebook memorial sites of the recently deceased. But others, like “griefers” who play online games in a manner that purposely disrupts other players, are more of a nuisance.</span></p>

<p><span>Who are these trolls, and what drives them?</span></p>

<h4 id="4d5f"><span>The dark tetrad</span></h4>

<p><span>Psychologists have found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914000324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a link between trollish behavior</a>&nbsp;and a set of personality traits called “the dark tetrad.”</span></p>

<figure><span><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2974/0*sAMy6kU4hSsBKYQy" alt=""></span></figure>

<p><span>The dark tetrad comprises:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Sadism — deriving pleasure from another’s pain</span></li>
<li><span>Psychopathy — impairment of empathy and remorse</span></li>
<li><span>Machiavellianism — manipulative and emotionally “cold” behavior</span></li>
<li><span>Narcissism — self-involvement and a need for admiration</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/41115419/Loneliness_moderates_the_relationship_between_Dark_Tetrad_personality_traits_and_internet_trolling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent study</a>, trolls were positively correlated with three of the four dark tetrad traits, with narcissism being the odd one out. They found trolls were manipulative, lacked empathy, and enjoyed hurting others. Men exhibited these traits more commonly than women and were more likely to troll. Loneliness was also a significant predictor of trolling when in the presence of Machiavellianism or psychopathy.</span></p>

<p><span>Most studies on trolls use internet surveys to collect data, which is questionable: Can we really trust trolls to complete surveys accurately? This method may also not account for those who don’t consider their behavior to be trollish or those unaware of their trollish behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>In the book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/troll-hunting-by-ginger-gorman/9781743794357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Troll Hunting</em></a>, journalist Ginger Gorman spends years building relationships with the worst trolls she can find in an attempt to understand what drives them. To her surprise, trolls were not uneducated lost souls who lacked social skills and lived in their mother’s basement. These trolls had partners, children, and full-time jobs. They showed leadership skills as commanders of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/28/it-was-like-being-skinned-alive-ginger-gorman-goes-hunting-for-trolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large trolling syndicates</a>. They were socially intelligent and able to pinpoint users’ weaknesses with vicious precision. But what was driving them?</span></p>

<p><span>Many saw trolling as a hobby — something that entertained or amused. Some were ideologically driven, attacking anybody opposing their belief system. But both types of troll tended to engage users that threatened their beliefs or sense of self.</span></p>

<p><span>Some of the trolls exhibited dark tetrad traits. In these trolls, she saw a common pattern — excessive internet use with little to no parental supervision between the ages of 11 and 16. But some trolls didn’t fit the dark tetrad personality type. These trolls were pleasant, friendly, and compassionate when she engaged them directly. How could these trolls behave so antisocially online yet appear to function as typical members of society offline?</span></p>

<h4 id="7160"><span>Empathy deficit</span></h4>

<p><span>The human brain was primarily designed for face-to-face interaction. It hasn’t had time to adapt to communication over the internet.</span></p>

<p><span>Nonverbal communication — facial expressions, gestures, and voice qualities — provides the precise social context of an interaction. While the claim that 93% of communication being nonverbal is&nbsp;<a href="https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ctamj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inaccurate</a>, it is a crucial part of how we communicate. Words alone can only go so far. Even if we used the full&nbsp;<a href="https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/language-lab/many-words-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">170,000 words</a>&nbsp;currently in use in the English language, we still couldn’t convey what an expressive face or a suggestive voice could.</span></p>

<p><span>Most internet discussions only allow words. Well, words and emojis and GIFs and stickers and all the other substitutes created to replace nonverbal cues.</span></p>

<p><span>If you say something mean to my face and make me cry, you will probably start to feel uncomfortable. Unless you’re especially mean or psychopathic, my distress will trigger an empathic response and lead you to have mercy. If you tweet something mean and make me cry, no amount of emojis can convey what the sight of a grown man weeping can. If there is no social cue to elicit an empathic response, you might continue your tirade of meanness.</span></p>

<p><span>The absence of nonverbal feedback leads to an “empathy deficit,” and this is what sociopaths suffer from.</span></p>

<h4 id="53a2"><span>Toxic disinhibition</span></h4>

<p><span>When you combine an empathy deficit with the anonymity of online interactions, you get “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic disinhibition</a>,” which is more than just the phenomenon of being rude to bar staff after that fifth shot of tequila.</span></p>

<p><span>Anonymity can lead to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deindividuation</a>” — a temporary loss of one’s identity leading to behavior incongruent with one’s character. It explains why groups of civilized people can engage in riots. It also explains trolling. If a lack of nonverbal cues is what makes us detached from the other person’s suffering, deindividuation is what makes us detached from the awareness of our misconduct.</span></p>

<p><span>True anonymity offers protection from real-world social repercussions, and this has profound effects on human behavior. The image-based bulletin board 4chan, where registration isn’t possible and users remain anonymous, has been&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/4chan-raids-how-one-dark-corner-of-the-internet-is-spreading-its-shadows-68394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous as a troll incubator</a>&nbsp;for this reason. When there are no real-world consequences to your actions, it liberates you from a lifetime of societally inhibited behaviors. Society discourages antisocial behavior and encourages prosocial behavior, so it is antisocial behavior that seeks liberation.</span></p>

<p><span>We are a delicate balance between prosocial humans and antisocial primates. When society cannot enforce prosocial human behavior, the antisocial primate may come back into power. And thus the troll is created.</span></p>

<h4 id="f597"><span>Troll begets troll</span></h4>

<p><span>Researchers at Stanford and Cornell universities performed a large-scale data analysis on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 16 million comments</a>&nbsp;from December 2012 to August 2013 on CNN.com and found 1 in 4 posts flagged as abusive were from users with no prior record of trollish behavior. This suggests trolling isn’t always a full-time occupation and that one may indulge sporadically.</span></p>

<p><span>The researchers could predict the likelihood of trolling based on the nature of other comments in the discussion and the user’s mood. If earlier comments were negative, the propensity to troll was greater. Like a bad mood, trolling is contagious. All it takes is another user’s trollish comment and a bad mood to create an environment in which our inner troll can blossom.</span></p>

<h4 id="b294"><span>The inner troll</span></h4>

<p><span>It is easier to view trolls as bad apples than see them as something inside all of us, waiting for the right environment to let loose. But when we condemn trolls as inherently malicious individuals, we limit our understanding of what may drive these behaviors.</span></p>

<p><span>While RIP trolls or suicide baiters are likely to be dark tetrad personality types who use the internet as an outlet to indulge their darkest impulses, lesser trolls may be part-time participants who will engage with the right combination of a bad day and a noxious environment. We have only begun to scratch the surface in our understanding of trolls, but the evidence we have suggests we may all be vulnerable.</span></p>

<p><span>Is anyone exempt from toxic disinhibition? Few respond to a tweet that offends them with “Excuse me, I really don’t want to be rude, but if I may could I please respectfully disagree with your opinion for these reasons …” While an offhand remark may appear harmless, the less empathic our online interactions collectively become, the greater risk we all stand of becoming trolls. The gentle ripples of impolite tweets may become crashing toxic waves of disinhibited hatred.</span></p>

<p><span>Trolling isn’t black and white, it is somewhere in the grey between prosocial human and antisocial primate. Ultimately, our propensity for antisocial behavior in the physical world is likely to predict similar online behavior.</span></p>

<h4 id="9272"><span>How can we manage our inner trolls?</span></h4>

<p><span>The more accountable we are for our behavior, the less potential we have of becoming trolls. Employing&nbsp;<a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/41373/1/paper0224.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less anonymity may help</a>, but this raises privacy concerns for many. Anonymity can also be a good thing. Benign disinhibition — the friendly sibling of toxic disinhibition — is where users freely discuss their deepest insecurities and concerns with other users. This can be very therapeutic and shouldn’t be discouraged. But by using anonymity only where it is necessary, we reduce the likelihood of toxic disinhibition.</span></p>

<p><span>Empathy doesn’t come …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Using Generators to Modernize a Geriatric Javascript API for <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<hr>
<p>How do you find-and-replace text on an HTML page?</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><span>Hello, </span><span>&lt;span&gt;</span><span>human</span><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>If the text is neatly neatly isolated inside an HTML element, it's easy; this will do:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"span"</span><span>)</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>"evolved ape"</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>But here's a puzzle</strong>: how do you you change text that <em>isn't</em> neatly isolated in an HTML element?</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> use <code>innerHTML</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>elt </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML </span><span>= </span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>...but this will hose any event listeners registered on <code>elt</code>'s children.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> grapple onto the nearest selectable element:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>.childNodes[</span><span>0</span><span>];
</span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yuck; this sort of child-node indexing feels <em>really</em> brittle.</p>
<p><strong>Why can't we just <em>directly</em> select the text nodes containing <code>Hello</code>?</strong></p>
<h2 id="xpath">XPath</h2>
<p><strong>We can!</strong> Enter: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a>, the <em>excessively</em> powerful language for querying XML documents. It's usable in web-browsers with the, uh, <em>descriptively</em>-named method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate"><code>document.evaluate</code></a>.</p>
<p>It's a <em>bit</em> of a production to use:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>xpath </span><span>= </span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>; </span><span>// find text nodes containing 'Hello'
</span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.body; </span><span>// look in the body element
</span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>; </span><span>// some sorta xml voodoo
</span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE; </span><span>// DEFINITELY MAKE SURE YOU USE THIS

</span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>) {
  </span><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, you really need to write <em>all</em> of that. The <code>result_type</code> argument is technically optional, but omit it at your own peril: without it, you must instead stream results via <code>iterateNext</code>, and this will crash with an exception if you dare <em>modify</em> the queried elements!</p>
<p>It's no wonder <code>document.evaluate</code> is seldom used. <strong>Can we improve on it?</strong></p>
<h2 id="iterizing-xpath-queries">Iterizing XPath Queries</h2>
<p>Yes, with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators"><strong>generators</strong></a>! We can exploit the implicit iterability of generators to modernize this unwieldy API:</p>
<pre><code><span>Document</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.xpath </span><span>= </span><span>Element</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.</span><span>xpath </span><span>=
  </span><span>function* </span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>this </span><span>instanceof </span><span>Document </span><span>? </span><span>document</span><span>.documentElement </span><span>: </span><span>this</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE;
    </span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)
      </span><span>yield </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  };
</span></code></pre>
<p>And because the result of this function is iterable, we can use it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spread syntax</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>)</span><span>].
  </span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>node </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>))</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>

<p>He settled the black terry sweat-band across his forehead, careful not to disturb the flat Sendai dermatrodes.<br>He closed his eyes.<br>A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky.<br>Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding –<br>And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of the Mitsubishi Bank of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of military systems, forever beyond his reach.<br>And somewhere he was laughing, in a white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face.</p>
<p>– William Gibson, <em>Neuromancer</em> (edited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe when times are tough we should take a moment to take a breath and marvel at the world around us. A flower blossoming towards the sky, a rose-tinted cloud at dawn, a painter's thoughtful stroke on a canvas.<br>And while I cultivate many passions, I often marvel at technology - because oh my, there is so much to marvel at!</p>
<p>It would be an understatement to say that a lot has happened since humankind cobbled together a bunch of silicium and electrocuted it into <em>thinking</em>, of all things. And while we have not quite reached Gibson's vision of cyberspace, I'd argue that we are, more likely than not, in a tech "golden age".</p>
<p>This might come as a surprise to you. After all, we're starting to see <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338">the end of Moore's law</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">few tech giants</a> have leveraged consumers' laziness to build an advertising market bubble that rules the world's economy, and a rising superpower's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace_Administration_of_China">Cyberspace Administration</a>" managed to deny 1.8 billion people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">free, uncensored access to information</a>.</p>
<p>And still, especially for hackers, makers, post-dotcom entrepreneurs and other digital-age freaks, now more than ever is the time to get excited.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted what was left of the old world into digitalization. Millions of apes wired to one another waited long months in their home for their screens to blink and tell them "lockdown's over". No 1984 science-fiction writer could have imagined such an alien scenario, nor its consequences.</p>
<p>As hordes of white-collar workers download videoconferencing software, unknowingly settling down in cyberspace for an ever-expanding portion of their lives, the curious among them will start to notice this is a land of opportunities.</p>
<p>Here, most resources can be leased dirt cheap and in unimaginable quantities - data storage, bandwidth, computing power. A common form of business are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> products, leased access to computer programs that, if made correctly, can accommodate a virtually unlimited number of tenants, effectively printing cash.</p>
<p>While we haven't figured out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface">dermatrodes</a> yet, you can dive in on a wide range of devices, and soon from pretty much anywhere on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink">this planet</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Internet">the next one</a>, too. Oh, you're also joining a growing population of <a href="https://internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">4.8 billion</a> humans - other inhabitants include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">connected IoT devices</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">crawlers</a> and other cyber automatons, and the occasional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">neural network</a>, which might have a <a href="https://liamp.substack.com/p/my-gpt-3-blog-got-26-thousand-visitors">blog</a> - in fact, you can't really <em>know</em> for sure that this very piece you're reading hasn't been written by one.</p>
<p>So go ahead, explore, learn, build something. Whatever it is you're thinking of, you can probably learn about, build, ship, and scale it on the Internet. Your paychecks live there too, as will your food orders, entertainment, relationships...</p>
<p>Meatspace is becoming more irrelevant each and every day.<br>Now is your time to punch deck and get yourself a place in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Golden Age.</p>

<p><em>How do we know what we know and what is there that we should know?</em></p>
<p>Video games like Age of Empires, Civilisation and others have the concept of technology trees.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/aoe.jpg">
<p>I study a lot, where should I spend my time? What should I read next? Is my knowledge broad enough?
I’ve used Goodreads quite extensively, it’s great to discover new books to read, mark your progress,
make friends and such.</p>
<p>Nowadays there’s so much information readily available, but not that many tools to help you
organise and allocate your “research points”.</p>
<h2 id="learning-together">Learning Together</h2>
<p>The recent COVID-19 pandemic surfaced the shortcomings of humanity to work together
to solve fundamental healthcare issues.
Some “experts” rushed to call it a black swan, despite it clearly not being one (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pandemic-isnt-a-black-swan-but-a-portent-of-a-more-fragile-global-system">read more</a>).</p>
<p>Thousands of Americans are victims of the opioid crisis and countless ones
are shoveling their money in the wild-west of unregulated fintech companies
with mottos like “anyone can be a trader” or in cryptocurrencies 🙃.</p>
<p>The media promote optimising for the short-term, making us think we’re the last generation to walk the planet.
Our countries are involved in wars, we fund wars with our taxes, yet the disasters
that war brings always seem so remote.</p>
<p>How do we respond? We <strong>educate</strong> ourselves, we <strong>talk</strong>, we <strong>act</strong>. A university degree or a code
bootcamp might help you land a job, but securing your freedom of thought is a never-ending struggle.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-learn">Learning to Learn</h2>
<p>Be more systematic, build your knowledge map and start exploring branch
by branch.
You don’t need a degree as a reward, nor any imaginary internet points.
The real reward is that you’ll be able to better understand the natural world and society.
Think of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMatter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> how much do you know about it? Do you want to be the person who forms
an opinion based on a couple of tweets or headlines?
Create a list of books, films, articles to go through and keep track of your progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading, has this incredible effect that it minimises your chances of becoming a racist,
an anti-vaxxer, a climate-change denier or a flat earther. Quite a reward ain’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="universities">Universities</h2>
<p>Universities play the role of gatekeepers of knowledge and the perpetuation of class segregation.
Your studies have a certain duration and you get a degree. While such a concept is valuable to maintain
the status quo and keep the economy going it doesn't really seem to be about knowledge.
Learning is a continuous process and universities should not extinguish your passion for knowledge in exchange for a degree.
For me, receiving my degree wasn't something to celebrate. It was rather a warrant to stay away from the
supposed mecca of learning.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/university.jpg">
<p>Fortunately in the digital age there are plenty of choices when it comes to expanding your knowledge.
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khanacademy</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> to name a few.
Most of them seem heavily leaning towards STEM studies though. Where do we learn about the world?</p>
<p>First things first, by “the world” I mean outside the tech bubble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I can fix your computer, but how do I fix racism, how do I get to know my body, improve my health,
manage my personal finances and understand democracy and political science, so to meaningfully
participate in the commons?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="theres-hope">There's Hope</h2>
<p>The open-source community is a fantastic example of people working asynchronously together and
having colossal impact in our lives.</p>
<p>A laughably simple algo to keep learning could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map your knowledge in a graph format</li>
<li>Keep notes / annotate your readings publicly</li>
<li>Pick another branch from the tree</li>
<li>Go to step 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, there's nothing embarrassing in admitting you don't know
something, it's empowering and the first step to master any subject.</p>
<p>What about the cover image of this post?
Well, I couldn't help it and wrote some code to support it.</p>

<p>Khanacademy used to have a <a href="https://khanacademy.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_Map">knowledge map</a> feature which I found
inspiring. Browsing a universe of infinite topics, continuing education ftw.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/ka_map.jpg">
<h3 id="building-my-knowledge-map">Building my Knowledge Map</h3>
<p>So, I decided to build my own map and needed to bootstrap it somehow. I
quickly extracted, cleaned and analysed the tags of my Tefter bookmarks.
For the uninitiated, <a href="https://tefter.io/">Tefter</a> is a social bookmarking app I use heavily and I also develop 🤠.</p>
<img src="https://zorbash.com/images/posts/knowledge_map/banner.jpg">
<p>On the graph, tags are nodes and edges connect topics when they appear as tags on the same bookmark.</p>

  <p>I often speak about the origins of Venmo in person and finally wrote down the story here to share with our latest intern class that started this week. (You can also watch an excellent video of Iqram speaking about even more of the history of Venmo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX7JCCCmLJw">here</a>. It’s a good place to pickup the story where this post leaves off.)</p>

<p>My friend Iqram and I started Venmo to solve a very simple problem for ourselves and for our friends: we noticed that we were still using cash and checks to pay each other back and thought this was silly. Everyone should be using PayPal to pay each other back, but no one we knew was. We thought something must be not quite right about the PayPal experience for casual use, and we decided to design something that felt “right,” something that felt consistent with all of the other mobile tools we used to interact with our friends, like SMS, Gmail, Facebook, etc. This is the story of how we got to Venmo.</p>

<h2 id="penn">Penn</h2>

<p>Iqram and I met as randomly paired freshman year roommates at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001. We’ve been great friends ever since.</p>

</figure>

<p>Iqram studied computer science at Penn. I started in computer science, but found that much of the learning I was doing happened while I was doing homework exercises, and I was getting no additional value out of the University. I couldn’t justify tuition costs when I was only learning by spending time doing programming exercises, and I developed a hypothesis that I would maximize the value of tuition costs by studying the least practical subjects possible, the things I would not get to do after graduation / outside of University, like reading and discussing great books with a group of incredibly smart students and professors (this backfired, btw–liberal arts is very practical stuff!). I eschewed big lectures and things like On Campus Recruiting, and tried to spend as much time possible in seminars and writing workshops. I ended up with majors in Philosophy and Creative Writing and minors in Computer Science and Logic.</p>

<p>I remained interested in building things during this time, however, and always took the opportunity to build websites for various clubs I was in or for friends with bands, etc.</p>

<p>During our senior year, Iqram and I built our first real project together, a college classifieds site called My Campus Post. It was our first taste of all night coding sessions to get a product to market, and we learned a bunch about grassroots marketing and retention challenges that arise from products with seasonal usage.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>I loved spending all of my time reading philosophy, working on fun side projects, and actively ignoring practical things like interviewing for jobs, but I clearly remember the day when my Mom was in town for graduation and she asked, “What are you doing after you graduate?” I was sitting on the floor of my dorm room, and I remember being very scared about the question, thinking, “I have no idea what I want to do with my life,” but also feeling OK about the short term, eventually answering, “I don’t have to move out of my dorm until 2 weeks after graduation. I’ll figure something out.”</p>

<h2 id="post-grad-door-to-door-sales">Post Grad Door to Door Sales</h2>

<p>Iqram ended up finding a cheap sublet in West Philly, and we spent the summer building websites for restaurants, salons, bars, etc. We went door to door selling, “Hey, you need a website. We’ll build it for $500…. $100? OK, deal.” We learned a lot as we tried to abstract the sites we were building into something modular, and we got a lot of experience pitching and hearing “no.” One “no” that I still regret more than most of the others I have subsequently heard (for much bigger deals) was for this amazing Pakistani restaurant, Kabobeesh, that served a chicken kabob sandwich on fresh naan bread for $3.50: we tried to sell them a site for 100 chicken rolls, but failed to close them.</p>

</figure>

<p>Once, we were chatting at a bar about how we might pad our sporadic income with some part time jobs. We noticed the bar was hiring, got two applications, and started filling them out. We spent a few minutes getting through all the basic background stuff, education, personal info, and got to the references section. We didn’t really have past employers to list at the time, so I put Iqram as a reference, and he put me. We were still rooming together at the time, so we had the same street address. We did not get a call back.</p>

<h2 id="swooge-and-philafunk">Swooge and Philafunk</h2>

<p>During this period, we were always also working on startup-y things, like a realtime website analytics tool called Swooge (which now reminds me of Chartbeat + Google Analytics) and a web based music selling platform, Philafunk (it was like iTunes + MySpace).</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/philafunk.jpg">
<figcaption>Philafunk site and flyer.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After working on a few of these, we realized we had a lot to learn about building a successful startup, so we decided to go find one and work there. Many of these projects we worked on were still in my opinion great ideas and solid evidence that execution matters much more than the idea.</p>

<h2 id="iminlikewithyou">iminlikewithyou</h2>

<p>So we found this NYC company, iminlikewithyou.com, that was just getting started out of Y Combinator, and we joined as 2 of the first 3 employees, all engineers starting together the day we moved to NYC. We had a talented team, built a really innovative, immersive web experience, and learned a bunch about doing startups for real. Eventually, the company pivoted from the original flirting-site idea into a casual games company (OMGPOP), and we both left because we weren’t interested in building games.</p>

<h2 id="ticketleap-and-bitly">Ticketleap and Bit.ly</h2>

<p>Iqram worked at Ticketleap as the VP of Engineering for a few years, and I bounced around and ended up spending a bunch of time working at Betaworks, on Bit.ly.</p>

<p>We both learned a lot during this period, but I looked forward to the time when we would work on a new project together, with more knowledge and experience this time. Over the years, I often brought up this idea, but the timing was never quite right.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-new-product-ideas">Exploring New Product Ideas</h2>

<p>In early 2009, Iqram chatted me mentioning that he was feeling ready to move on from Ticketleap, and I remember thinking, “Great let’s do this.” We began getting together on weekends (he was in Philly and I was in NYC) to hack on different ideas.</p>

<h2 id="yogorino">Yogorino</h2>

<p>We had a friend in Philadelphia who was opening a yogurt shop, and while helping her get up and running technically, we realized how horrible traditional point of sales software was. We prototyped a web based point of sales software that would turn any laptop into a cash register with a $50 USB magtek swiper. As we thought about it more, it seemed like this would present a really challenging distribution problem (we remembered our days of door to door restaurant sales…). Plus, although this was designed to solve a problem for one of our friends, it wasn’t software that we would be using ourselves daily.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h2 id="back-to-music">Back to Music</h2>

<p>Another idea we explored came to us at a local jazz show: we thought, “It would be awesome to be able to download this show by sending a text message to this band right now, and then have an mp3 show up in our email.” This was getting closer to the Venmo concept we ultimately arrived at, and the detailed wireframes we constructed for this definitely informed a lot of the original Venmo service.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/rootsbuy.png">
<figcaption>Wireframe for selling music downloads via SMS.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This concept even bore the Venmo name. Lots of people ask about the origin of the name. The brainstorming process was one of many we tried and was not important as the requirements. We were exploring the Latin root vendere “sell” and mo for mobile, but purely as a means to get to a name that (1) was short, 5-6 letters, (2) could be a verb, (3) didn’t have a unintuitive spelling, and (4) was cheap. Venmo was available on GoDaddy and met the important criteria, so we grabbed it.</p>

<h2 id="discovering-venmo">Discovering Venmo</h2>

<p>One of the weekends we were getting together to work on this idea, Iqram was visiting me in NYC and left his wallet in Philly. I covered him for the whole weekend, and he ended up writing me a check to pay me back. It was annoying for him to have to find a checkbook to do this, and annoying for me to have to go to the bank if I wanted to cash it (I never did). We thought, “Why are we still doing this? We do everything else with our phones. We should definitely be using PayPal to pay each other back. But we don’t, and none of our friends do.”</p>

<p>So we decided, let’s just try to solve this problem, and build a way to pay each other back that feels consistent with all of the other experiences we have in apps we use with our friends.</p>

<p>We got pretty excited about this idea, and thought, “Surely someone else must be doing this.” We found a laptop and started googling, and soon came across Obopay: a way to send money to anyone directly from your cell phone. They had recently raised $70M from Nokia, and we thought, “Uh-oh.” But then we poked around the website and the product and found that there was no feel and it seemed a little clunky and not like something anyone we knew would ever use.</p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-the-note">Evolution of the Note</h2>

<p>We got a prototype working pretty quickly. It worked over SMS, and was dead simple. To send iqram $20, text “iqram 20” to our number (a hacked Google Voice account, because the alternative, Textmarks, required that you prefix every text message with a keyword–this was back in the days before Twilio…). The recipient saw “kortina paid you $20.”</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/git/origins-of-venmo/gvhack.png">

</figure>

<p>Right after we got this working we decided we needed to have a note with each payment so we could keep track of what all of these random amounts were for: “iqram 20 for thai lunch at Nooch.”</p>

<p>The interface was SMS, so we immediately thought, of course it would only be natural for the person on the other end to see the message, so we updated …</p></article></div>

What are the challenges of writing portable BPF programs that developers need to deal with? This post will describe BPF portability problem and how BPF CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere) is helping to address this problem.</p>
<!--truncate-->

<h2>BPF: state of the art</h2>
<p>Since the inception of (e)BPF, it’s been a constant priority for the BPF community to simplify BPF application development as much as possible, make it as straightforward and familiar of an experience as it would be for a user-space application. And with the steady progress around BPF programmability, writing BPF programs has never been easier.</p>
<p>Despite these usability improvements, though, one aspect of BPF application development has been neglected (mostly for technical reasons): portability. What does "BPF portability" mean, though? We define <strong>BPF portability</strong> as the ability to write a BPF program that will successfully compile and pass kernel verification, and will work <strong>correctly</strong> across <em>different kernel versions</em> without the need to recompile it for each particular kernel.</p>
<p>This note describes the BPF portability problem and our solution to it: BPF CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere). First, we’ll look at the BPF portability problem itself, describing why it is a problem and why it’s important to solve it. Then, we will outline high-level components of our solution, BPF CO-RE, and will give a glimpse into the pieces of the puzzle that needed to be put together to make it happen. We’ll conclude with a tutorial of sorts, describing the user-visible API of the BPF CO-RE approach and demonstrating its application with examples.</p>
<h2>The problem of BPF portability</h2>
<p>A BPF program is a piece of user-provided code which is injected straight into a kernel. Once loaded and verified, BPF programs execute in kernel context. These programs operate inside kernel memory space with access to all the internal kernel state available to it. This is extremely powerful and is one of the reasons why BPF technology is successfully used in so many varied applications. However, this powerful capability also creates the BPF portability pains we have today: BPF programs do not control memory layout of a surrounding kernel environment. They have to work with what they get from independently developed, compiled, and deployed kernels.</p>
<p>Additionally, kernel types and data structures are in constant flux. Different kernel versions will have struct fields shuffled around inside a struct, or even moved into a new inner struct. Fields can be renamed or removed, their types changed, either into some trivially-compatible ones or completely different ones. Structs and other types can get renamed, or they can be conditionally compiled out (depending on kernel configuration), or just plain removed between kernel versions.</p>
<p>In other words, things change all the time between kernel releases and yet BPF application developers are expected to cope with this problem somehow. How is it even possible to do anything useful with BPF today considering this ever-changing kernel environment? There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, not all BPF programs need to look into internal kernel data structures. One example is <code>opensnoop</code> tool, which relies on kprobes/tracepoints to track which processes open which files, and just needs to capture a few syscall arguments to work. As syscall parameters offer a stable ABI, these don’t change between kernel versions and as such portability is not a concern to begin with. Unfortunately, applications like this are quite rare. These types of applications are also typically quite limited in what they can do.</p>
<p>So, additionally, BPF machinery inside kernel provides a limited set of "stable interfaces" that BPF programs can rely on to be stable between kernels. In reality, underlying structures and mechanisms do change, but these BPF-provided stable interfaces abstract such details from user programs.</p>
<p>As one example, for networking applications it is usually enough to look at a limited set of <code>sk_buff</code>'s attributes (and packet data, of course) to be extremely useful and versatile. To that end, BPF verifier provides a stable <strong><code>__sk_buff</code></strong> "view" (notice underscores in front), which shields BPF programs from changing <code>struct sk_buff</code> layout. All the <code>__sk_buff</code> field accesses are transparently rewritten into an actual <code>sk_buff</code> accesses (sometimes quite elaborate ones – doing a bunch of internal pointer chasing before finally fetching requested field). Similar mechanisms are available to a bunch of different BPF program types. They are done as program type-specific BPF contexts understood by BPF verifier. So, if you are developing a BPF program with such context, consider yourself lucky, you can blissfully live in a nice illusion of stability.</p>
<p>But as soon as you need to get a glimpse at any raw internal kernel data (e.g., very commonly a <code>struct task_struct</code> which represents a process/thread and contains a treasure trove of process information), you are on your own. It is commonly the case for tracing, monitoring, and profiling applications, which are a huge class of extremely useful BPF programs.</p>
<p>In such cases, how do you make sure you are not reading garbage data when some kernel added an extra field before the field you thought is, say, at offset 16 from the start of <code>struct task_struct</code>? Suddenly, for that kernel, you'll need to read data from, e.g., offset 24. And the problems don't end there: what if a field got renamed, as was the case with <code>thread_struct</code>'s <code>fs</code> field (useful for accessing thread-local storage), which got renamed to <code>fsbase</code> between 4.6 and 4.7 kernels. Or what if you have to run on two different configurations of a kernel, one of which disabled some specific feature and completely compiled out parts of the struct (a common case for additional accounting fields, which are optional, but extremely useful if present)? All this means that you can no longer compile your BPF program locally using kernel headers of your dev server and distribute it in compiled form to other systems, while expecting it to work and produce correct results. This is because kernel headers for different kernel versions will specify a different memory layout of data your program relies on.</p>
<p>So far, people have been dealing with this problem by relying on <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/">BCC</a> (BPF Compiler Collection). With BCC, you embed your BPF program C source code into your user-space program (control application) <em>as a plain string</em>. When control application is eventually deployed and executed on target host, BCC invokes its embedded Clang/LLVM, pulls in local kernel headers (which you have to make sure are installed on the system from correct <code>kernel-devel</code> package), and performs compilation on the fly. This will make sure that memory layout that BPF program expects is exactly the same as in the target host's running kernel. If you have to deal with some optional and potentially compiled-out stuff in kernel, you'll just do <code>#ifdef</code>/<code>#else</code> guarding in your source code to accommodate such hazards as renamed fields, different semantics of values, or any optional stuff not available on current configuration. Embedded Clang will happily remove irrelevant parts of your code and will tailor BPF program code to specific kernel.</p>
<p>This sounds great, doesn't it? Not quite so, unfortunately. While this workflow works, it's not without major drawbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clang/LLVM combo is a big library, resulting in big fat binaries that need to be distributed with your application.</p></li>
<li><p>Clang/LLVM combo is resource-heavy, so when you are compiling BPF code at start up, you'll use a significant amount of resources, potentially tipping over a carefully balanced production workfload. And vice versa, on a busy host, compiling a small BPF program might take minutes in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>You are making a big bet that the target system will have kernel headers present, which most of the time is not a problem, but sometimes can cause a lot of headaches. This is also an especially annoying requirement for kernel developers, because they often have to build and deploy custom one-off kernels as part of their development process. And without a custom-built kernel header package, no BCC-based application will work on such kernels, stripping developers of a useful set of tools for debugging and monitoring.</p></li>
<li><p>BPF program testing and development iteration is quite painful as well, as you are going to get even most trivial compilation errors only in runtime, once you recompile and restart your user-space control application. This certainly increases friction and is not helping to iterate fast.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while BCC is a great tool, especially for quick prototyping, experimentation, and small tools, it certainly has lots of disadvantages when used for widely deployed production BPF applications.</p>
<p>We are stepping up the game of BPF portability with BPF CO-RE and believe this is a future of BPF program development, especially for complex real-world BPF applications.</p>
<h2>High-level BPF CO-RE mechanics</h2>
<p>BPF CO-RE brings together necessary pieces of functionality and data at all levels of the software stack: kernel, user-space BPF loader library (libbpf), and compiler (Clang) – to make it possible and easy to write BPF programs in a portable manner, handling discrepancies between different kernels within the same pre-compiled BPF program. BPF CO-RE requires a careful integration and cooperation of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BTF type information, which allows to capture crucial pieces of information about kernel and BPF program types and code, enabling all the other parts of BPF CO-RE puzzle;</p></li>
<li><p>compiler (Clang) provides means for BPF program C code to express the intent and record relocation information;</p></li>
<li><p>BPF loader (<a href="https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf">libbpf</a>) ties BTFs from kernel and BPF program together to adjust compiled BPF code to specific kernel on target hosts;</p></li>
<li><p>kernel, while staying completely BPF CO-RE-agnostic, provides advanced BPF features to enable some of the more advanced scenarios.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Working in ensemble, these components …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

You can find out more about online share dealing and its associated costs in our <a href="https://www.koody.co/investing/shares">Investing in Shares guide</a>.<br>‍<br><span><strong>Important:</strong></span><strong><br></strong>The table below shows annual charges of several share dealing platforms when you invest lump sums of £5,000, £20,000 or £100,000 in one year and make 12 ad hoc deals in the same year. A deal is either one of buying or selling an investment. It is also called a trade. We've used the colour red to indicate what platforms are more expensive compared to the others. This means the darker the shade of red, the more expensive the platform. Dark red doesn't mean bad or too expensive; it just means the platform is more expensive than others. If you would like to see a breakdown of fees charged by each platform, have a look at our <a href="https://www.koody.co/investing/charges-directory">Platform Charges Directory</a>.</p><p>We haven't included any calculations for regular investing, but we do note in the second column, regular investing dealing fees for your information.</p><p>Finally, it is important to let you know we show the costs which apply to the first year only. This is especially important because, with platforms such as iWeb, your charges reduce after the first year. Whereas, with platforms such as EQi, your charges might increase after the first year. You'll find all the details you need below. For each provider we list, your money is protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means you could get your money back up to £85,000 if any of the companies goes bust.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’m very interested in how startups validate their ideas. I’m finding that actually a staggering amount of them barely do. Or just do it very badly.</p>



<p>There’s no one right way to validate a startup idea. And, even if you do it perfectly, it doesn’t guarantee success. But it does hugely reduce the risk of failure.</p>



<p>What I outline below is the method I’ve been using for a while. It’s <strong>not comprehensive</strong>, and each of the steps can be done in a much more detailed way. But it’s <strong>quick</strong>, captures good data, and gives you a very strong footing to start your journey.</p>



<p>TL;DR</p>



<ul><li>Define your customer – 1 hour</li><li>Read a book – 3 hours</li><li>Write your hypothesis – 1 hour</li><li>Create and distribute a survey – 4 hours</li><li>Speak to people (properly!) – 10+ hours</li></ul>

<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of each one of these. </p>



<p>1 – Define your potential market, and your potential customer. You may already have a typical customer in mind, but try to drill down into something specific. It’s not enough to just say “This is for entrepreneurs”. Or “It’s for single mums”. You need to define them more clearly by their behaviours, as well as their primary characteristics. Try something like “Time-rich, cash-poor,&nbsp; freelancers who need extra sources of income”. Or “High net worth individuals who take more than ten flights for business a year”. </p>



<p>2 (Optional, but VERY strongly recommended) – Read <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>. I think it’s the most important business book I’ve ever read, and it fundamentally changed how I talk to (potential) customers. It stopped me being obsessed with my product, and fall in love with the problem. I should get commission for how often I recommend it! If you have already read it, and are confident that you don’t need to refresh your memory, then move on to stage 3.</p>



<p>The Mom Test is a book that helps you speak to your customers in a way in which they can’t lie to you, subconsciously or otherwise. By talking about their life, and the problems they face around your area of interest, INSTEAD of your solution, you get an unfiltered, unbiased set of feedback about what they REALLY want to have solved. And not just feedback to the idea you have presented to them, which is probably a very different thing. This is a VERY important thing to understand, especially as “no market need” is the most often cited reason for startups failing.</p>



<p>Don’t let your ego get in the way of having a successful business. <strong>Your solution isn’t more important than their problem.</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t want to spend 3 hours reading the book, spend an hour<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1Fa-t4AEQ&amp;t=0s"> watching the author talk about it</a>. If you don’t want to spend an hour watching that, spend three minutes watching<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hla1jzhan78"> this video</a>, or reading<a href="https://medium.com/@nataliekorotaeva/how-to-talk-with-your-users-3-takeaways-from-the-mom-test-by-rob-fitzpatrick-bbeb4a93ba07"> this blogpost</a>. Ideally you’ll do all of the above, just so you fully embrace the idea.</p>

<p>3 – Write your hypothesis. I won’t write too much here, as there are lots of great blogposts out there that do a great job of explaining good ways of nailing this. In short, you’re looking to find a hypothesis that you can test with your customer conversations. There are several different templates for this, but this is a simple one to start with. </p>



<p><em>I believe [target market] will [engage in this behaviour / use this solution] for [this reason].</em></p>



<p>You can refine this as you go along, and as you speak to customers. After all, there’s a very good chance that your research will show you that your hypothesis is wrong – and therefore you’ve just saved yourself thousands of Pounds, Dollars, or Euros, and 2 years of your life. Yay!</p>



<p>If your hypothesis is proven wrong, you can come up with a new one, and start again. </p>



<p>4 – Design a survey that is easy to distribute, and easy to fill in (multiple choice here). The idea is to capture some rough data, but mainly it’s the top of a funnel for getting people on the phone to the real interviews. </p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSwINF3uDxeD2fx0Y5sWaX9esyrG39HzCzeXSPMcwMRo5wnw/viewform?usp=sf_link">an example of a real, live survey</a> that I’m currently using to capture data from potential customers. Feel free to steal the format, and also <strong>feel free to fill it in if you’re an early stage founder, too</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ve used Google Forms in this example, but I also heartily recommend the services of <a href="https://doopoll.co/">Doopoll</a>.</p>



<p>Make it mainly multi-choice, to make it a low barrier to people filling t in, but if you feel like you want to devote one question to free-entry, then go ahead. It can sometimes be a simple “Is there anything else you would like to tell us?” thing at the end.</p>



<p>Distribute via the usual channels, and call in favours from people who can help you reach your target market.</p>



<p>Hint – <strong>Twitter is a search engine for human beings</strong>. Want to find people interested in, for example, medtech? There’s a ton of hashtags these people will use, and that info may also be in their bio. It wouldn’t take too long to tweet a few hundred of them with a polite message, asking them to give you 2 mins of their time to fill in the survey, as they’re interested in your area of research.</p>



<p>Bonus – it’s an email list for you to approach to be your beta users once you have an MVP up and running. But, be respectful. These people gave you their time for free, so don’t just add them to a never-ending drip campaign.</p>

<p>4 – Speak to the ones you have chosen. Read The Mom Test *before* you speak to them. It’ll allow you to ask questions that get to the root of the real problems they face in this area, and not just answer questions that are limited to the scope of your proposed product. In an ideal world, they’ll end the session not having a clue what your product is. It’s all about them, NOT your product.</p>



<p>I’d strongly recommend speaking to at least 25 people. Preferably more like 50. If you have chosen a well-enough defined target (and not just something vague like “car owners” or “entrepreneurs”), and you listen carefully, clear trends will start to emerge. And these may well be problems that you can solve!</p>



<p>Hint – I strongly recommend Calendly (or similar) to provide a 15 or 20-min link to your interviewees, allowing them to book the relevant slot in your calendar. This will give them confidence that you intend to honour your 15 min promise. It also keeps you concise in your questioning, and get to the point. If they’re happy to keep talking, that’s great. But don’t abuse their goodwill.</p>



<p>Finally – Fall in love with the problem, not your product. The market, in a true economic sense, doesn’t care about your product. It only cares about you being able to solve a problem. Don’t succumb to Ugly Baby Syndrome, where you have come up with an idea that you LOVE, and you’re deaf to any market signals that tell you that it’s no good.</p>



<p>I know that I’ve made this mistake in the past. To be enthusiastic, and in love with your idea is a very normal thing. And it’s particularly typical of entrepreneurs, as we’re all out trying to change the world. But we’ve been mis-sold the concept that the moment of genius, and the idea itself, is sacrosanct. But successful entrepreneurship is about a disciplined process. And validation is an absolutely vital part of it.</p>



<p>I once had the “product-first instead of problem-first” way of doing things described to me as “<strong>designing a key (product) and running around trying to find a lock (problem) that it will open</strong>“. Surely it’s much better to find a lock, study it, understand it, then design a key to open it. </p>



<p>If you’ve done all the steps above, you now understand the lock MUCH better. Go make a key to open it.</p>



<p>Update – I’ve had a few people ask for my input on their ideas. If you’d like a free mentoring session, you can <a href="https://neilcocker.com/toughquestions/">book in here</a>.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels </a>makes about $600,000 a year. He taught himself to code and has an unconventional philosophy. This is not an interview but an analysis piece. Pieter defied the critics and built Nomad List and Remote OK into successful businesses without cutting edge tools like React or other modern frameworks. I send articles like this twice a week - <a href="https://nocsdegree.carrd.co/">join 2,000 developers that get the newsletter</a>.</p><h2 id="who-is-pieter-levels">Who is Pieter Levels</h2><p>Pieter is a self-taught developer from The Netherlands. He has an MBA but no coding qualifications. As we will see in today's article he has a rough and ready approach to coding but it pays off handsomely. </p><p>His <a href="https://www.nomadlist.com/">Nomad List</a> directory and community for digital nomads draws in over $300k a year and that's despite a recent fall in revenue due to people not travelling during the Corona virus crisis. </p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-23.30.06.png" alt=""></figure><p>His Remote Ok job board for remote workers made <a href="https://remoteok.io/open">$300,000 over the last 12 months</a></p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-23.23.51.png" alt="Revenue chart for Remote OK job board"></figure><p>So that's a total of $600,00 from the last 12 months! Not bad for a self-taught developer! Pieter is active on Twitter and has a very stong following there. </p><p>As he works for himself he is able to travel extensively and live where he choses. Although, rather than the common misconception of digital nomads being constantly on the move, Pieter recommends spending a few months in each place. This way you avoid travel burnout. </p><h2 id="how-did-pieter-levels-learn-to-code">How did Pieter Levels learn to code?</h2><p>Not a lot is known about his very earlies forays into coding apart from the fact that as a teenager he played around programming. His first attempt at a web business was an analytics service for Youtube which would let you see how all your videos/channels were performing in one place. Unfortunately, he worked on it for a year without making any money from it. </p><p>From that point Pieter adopted his now familar approach to coding and business - build websites quickly and monetize from the beginning. He only adds more features if there is money coming in and the idea is validated by the market.</p><p>Pieter takes the "search on Google" approach to Google. So when he wanted to connect a database to a website or make a button do something on his website he would just search the terms on Google and find solutions in places like Stackoverflow. Pieter is a strong critic of the approach of doing courses as he believes people learn best by doing and building. </p><p>One analogy would be different approaches to learning Spanish. One person might study a course, learn the correct grammar and then go to Spain. Whereas Pieter would go to Spain, ask for the words he needs to use and go from there. </p><p>When asked in the past why he didn't use modern frameworks like React he made the point that as he was a solo founder he couldn't afford to spend time re-building his websites as this would mean his project would stall. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/GGofo"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/08/monetize.png" alt="monetize"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-technologies-does-pieter-levels-use">What technologies does Pieter Levels use?</h2><p>Pieter is famous (or infamous) for having a rather eccentric choice of stack by modern standards. It's essentially the easiest, least glamorous tools you could imagine. But that's ok because Pieter makes $600k a year! </p><p>Here is his stack:</p><ul><li>HTML (hand coded so no template to make life easier)</li><li>CSS (He has used pre-processors like LESS and SASS in the past)</li><li>Javascript (No frameworks - this is sometimes referred to jokingly as Vanilla Javascript. There is no such thing as Vanilla JS though. It's just plain-old Javascript without a framework such as React, Vue or Angular) </li><li>jQuery (An unfashionable choice nowadays but it does the job)</li><li>PHP (He doesn't use any frameworks like Laravel)</li><li>SQLite - Pieter says it's super quick and swears by it. SQLite is a database written in a single file so Pieter doesn't need to set up a server for it. &nbsp;</li><li>his sites are hosted on a single VPS running Ubuntu with NGINX.</li></ul><p>Here are some modern options Pieter doesn't use </p><ul><li>React - he jokes a lot about how he never wants to learn it due to it's (perceived) complexity. </li><li>Node - for a time he considered using it but he's never used it in production</li><li>Angular/ Vue - he doesn't use any Javascript frameworks </li><li>SQL/ Postgres - he doesn't use any of the conventional databases </li></ul><h2 id="get-a-job-without-a-cs-degree-">Get a job without a CS degree 👇</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="http://nocsok.com/"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-07-at-17.35.28-2.png" alt="No-CS-OK-screenshot-1"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-results-has-pieter-had-with-this-approach-to-coding">What results has Pieter had with this approach to coding?</h2><p>Despite the technical critics, Pieter has been consistently making six figures since 2014. He currently makes approximately $600,000 a year which is far more than most developers. He has been able to live in countries with a low cost of living so he will likely be able to have financial independence and not need to work relatively soon. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📈 Record sales yesterday of $2,342.04 on <a href="https://t.co/S9Qv34rpbP">https://t.co/S9Qv34rpbP</a> for no apparent reason (maybe companies are spending their EOY HR budgets?).

He "built in public" - that is to say he gave daily updates of his code on Twitter. This is also a great way for developers to build an audience!

One is going to win no matter what and one is going to follow the rules they have trained under and have finer technique. Neither is better or worse. It depends on the situation. </p><p>Pieter's approach would not be good if you were trying to get a job in a lot of companies. But Pieter isn't looking for a job and the proof for him is in his bank balance. So Pieter's scrappy technique is better suited if you are attracted to coding for entrepreneurship and being a solo founder who doesn't have to share their code with others to work on. He doesn't use Github to save his code, for instance and this is an industry standard that most employers expect. If you want to be an indie hacker/entrepreneur though then Pieter is a fine act to follow. </p><h3 id="if-you-enjoyed-this-article-please-send-it-to-a-friend">If you enjoyed this article please send it to a friend </h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="and-you-should-totally-sign-up-for-the-newsletter">And you should totally <a href="https://nocsdegree.carrd.co/">sign up for the newsletter</a> </h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Back in 2011, I happened to get a job writing <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> app. If you never did that, don’t. I was complaining about difficulties with composition left and right to whoever would listen. As I started digging into alternatives for the front-end, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">FRP</a> and <a href="https://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax</a>, and <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>. The last one got me hooked on <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I even did a <a href="https://fwdays.com/event/js-frameworks-day-2013/review/Functional-Reactive-Programming-&amp;-ClojureScript">successful talk</a> on FRP and ClojureScript (and precursor to <a href="https://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a>, called hlisp).</p>
<h2 id="react">React</h2>
<p>Then in May 2013 React was released. I championed it on my new job and discovered during Clojure-themed hackaton (<a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2013/clojurecup/">Clojure Cup 2013</a>) that CLJS and React are a great match. What’s so good about React though? To me, the main selling point is that it composes well.</p>
<p>When you use predecessors like jQuery or Backbone or Angular or whatever after just a year of development your code is a mess of event listeners and triggers. Don’t get me started on unobtrusive JS, code locality is non-existent with jQuery. Which handler is bound where and what it does? It’s too hard to discover to be a good base for a good codebase!</p>
<p>Then I started working at <a href="https://kasta.ua/">Kasta</a>, where web frontend was exactly that jQuery-ish mess. Nobody ever wanted to touch checkout, since you could spend hours, if not days, making the smallest change. Then QA would find more invalid states than you can dream of. And then users would report more bugs to our call center. It was just as awful as you can imagine.</p>
<p>So after some experiments, tests, and checks, I decided that we’re going React + ClojureScript way with server-side rendering done in Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="demise">Demise</h2>
<p>And for a while, things were looking good. We had this <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2017/server-side-rendering/">architecture</a> where our components are executed as Clojure on the backend, so no Node.js on the server, hurray! And developer UX is through the roof with the excellent live reload (thanks CLJS), ability to connect from your editor to browser REPL, and experiment there. It is just great!</p>
<p>To make a long story short, our frontend grew bigger and bigger. Incremental compilation started to become slower — it now routinely takes more than a second or two. And while there were few attempts on keeping the whole app performant, ultimately we failed. It’s a death by a thousand cuts. The application became too big and its boot time became too long. Server side rendering helps partially, but then hydration freezes the browser. On the older hardware or Androids it became unacceptable!</p>
<p>One of the main reasonings back in 2016 was that we take a hit on startup time, but in turn, get no page loads and have a rich web application with a lot of interactions. And for a while that worked! But startup time became longer and longer, leading to a shameful rating of 5/100 from Google’s PageSpeed (okay, it was sometimes up to ~25/100, whatever).</p>
<p>More than that, while doing what is described below, we’ve discovered that React also leads to some questionable practices. Like hovers in JS (rather than in CSS), drop-down menus in JS, not rendering hidden (under a hover) text (Google won’t be happy), weird complex logic (since it’s possible!), etc. You can have a React app without those problems, but apparently, you have to have better self-control than we had (nobody’s perfect!).</p>
<p>Also since then, the vast majority of our users switched to mobile apps. This made the web app the main entry point for new users. This means its main goal is rendering fast for a newcomer, because old-timers, which want more functionality, are on mobile app now. And <a href="https://web.dev/tti/">TTI</a> (time to interactive) is so much more important here.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-change">Time For A Change</h2>
<p>So given that circumstances have changed, what do we do? I read articles “how I survive on vanilla JS” since before React appeared and they usually don’t make sense — it’s either a pink-glassed rant about how great it is, disregarding all the problems (separation of concerns, cohesion, composability, code locality) or a project by one (or few) persons, who just keep everything in their head.</p>
<p>Somewhere back in February I stumbled upon <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Intercooler.js</a>. I’m not sure if I ever saw it before — maybe I did but skimmed over — it does not matter. This time it captured my attention.</p>
<p>The idea is that all HTML is rendered on the server. And client updates parts of HTML, controlled by element’s attributes. Basically like HTML+XHR on steroids. You can’t do anything you want, but that’s partially the point: some limits are good so you won’t do crazy stuff. And you need some support from the server, so you can render partial results — just an optimization, but quite an important one.</p>
<p>There is an alternative library — <a href="https://unpoly.com/">Unpoly</a>. It has more features around layout and styling but has a little bit less thought out XHR stuff (hard to do a POST request with parameters without having a form, for example). And the library size is much bigger. And it’s written in CoffeeScript with lots of classes, <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/inheritance/">ugh</a>.</p>
<p>So I made a proof-of-concept implementation of our catalogue page in Intercooler and it worked! Except there was a dependency on jQuery and some other irritating stuff… As I was struggling to make a batch request for HTML fragments I understood one thing: when I wrote down a roadmap for catalogue the last point was “small intercooler-like thing for analytics”.</p>
<p>So why wait?</p>
<h2 id="twinspark">TwinSpark</h2>
<p>I liked Intercooler’s coherent approach to working around AJAX, so I decided to name the library after some automotive stuff as well, and TwinSpark seems like an appropriate name. So what’s the deal?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kasta-ua/twinspark-js">TwinSpark</a> is a framework for declarative HTML enhancement: you put additional attributes on your element and TwinSpark does something with them. Like makes an AJAX call and replaces target with a response, or adds a class, or… well, see <a href="https://kasta-ua.github.io/twinspark-js/">examples</a>, shall you?</p>
<p>There are some differences with Intercooler, of course, because why would it exist? The most noticeable one is that there is no dependency on jQuery. It supports only modern browsers (not IE or Opera Mini) but drops that 88kb monster.</p>
<p>It also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no inheritance — can’t stress that enough!</li>
<li>clear extension points for your directives</li>
<li>support for batching requests to a server</li>
<li>tighter attribute name convention (my own opinion, but <code>ic-get</code> and <code>ic-post</code> irritate me: do not make me change keys!)</li>
<li>much smaller payload (thanks to no jQuery!)</li>
<li>should be faster (thanks to no jQuery again)</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly speaking, the main reasons are <a href="https://kasta-ua.github.io/twinspark-js/#batch">batching</a> and <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/inheritance/">no inheritance</a>. Inheritance is particularly painful here. In Intercooler, if you declared <code>ic-target</code> on the body, all tags inside will think it’s their target too. So you include a component somewhere in HTML tree and an attribute higher on tree changes this component behavior. I mean this is a freaking dynamic scope, I want none of that! :)</p>
<p>Funnily enough, after about a month of dabbling with TwinSpark, Intercooler’s author announced that he’s doing a jQuery-less modern version: <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>. :) It has really good extensions points, so maybe it’s possible to add batching… but inheritance is still there. :-(</p>
<h2 id="why-is-that-a-good-idea">Why is that a good idea</h2>
<p>We need to look at it from two sides: if it’s good for developers and if it’s good for users. React was great at former and terrible at later.</p>
<p>TwinSpark approach is much better in most cases for the user: less JavaScript, less jitter, more common HTML-like behavior. In the worst case, we would serve you 2.5MB of minified (non-gzipped) JS and 700KB of HTML (half of it were initial data for React) for catalogue. JS bundle is not that big because of embedded images or css or some other obscure stuff, it’s big because it’s the whole app, with a lot of views and logic.</p>
<p>Now it’s 40KB of minified non-gzipped JS (TwinSpark, analytics, some behavior, IntersectionObserver polyfill) and 350KB of HTML. Two orders of magnitude difference and even HTML is smaller! This is just like Christmas in childhood!</p>
<p>On the developer side, I think React is better still, but code locality is great, composability is much better (since you are forced in a limited world of working in a simplistic model) than with jQuery. Plus there are a lot of ways to improve it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the development process did not change that much! We’re still writing components that query necessary data from site-wide memory store (and make a call to API when needed), but they are executed only on the server. We effectively piggy-backend on our previous architecture, and this gives us the perfect ability to render “partial” HTML - since components do not wait for some “controller” to give them all necessary data. This is what allowed us to have both React and non-React versions to co-exist and make an A/B test without writing the markup twice.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>It took us four months since the first experiments to release. Not exactly the amount of time I imagined when we started (“should take two to three weeks at most!"), heh, but we were not exclusively doing that. It still took a lot of time and energy to remove React-isms from the code and wrangle our app to be a server-side citizen. It still could use some polishing, but we decided to release it despite that just to cut it short. And A/B test showed that we were right — especially for Android phones.</p>
<p>Google gives our catalogue 75/100 now instead of 5/100. Hurray, I guess? :)</p>

        <p>The GemRB team announces the availability of GemRB 0.8.7, a new minor release to kick off
a week of celebrations of the project’s founding anniversary. 20 years ago, on the 21st of
August, the project initiator Daniele Colantoni registered it on SourceForge to try to make
it a team effort. Many things have happened since, the path was convoluted and bumpy, but
GemRB has continued to grow throughout the years.</p>

<p>GemRB is a portable free/libre open-source implementation of Bioware’s Infinity Engine, which
powered classic CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The goal of
the project is to make these games available on a wide range of platforms forever, fix or avoid
old bugs, add new features and provide a superb platform for mod (and eventually game) development.</p>

<p>It was started 20 years ago by a student fresh out of town, Daniele Colantoni:
<em>“I missed playing D&amp;D with my friends so much /…/ I wanted to create my game to play
via internet. So I started my personal reverse engineering process on the base files
from Baldur’s Gate.”</em></p>

<p>Predictably it turned out to be much more complicated and time consuming than first
imagined, but the effort continued. From its Windows-only 32-bit beginnings GemRB was
made to run on all common and many niche platforms (from AmigaOS to IRIX and Symbian;
x86 to PPC, ARM, MIPS and WebAssembly). This was largely made possible through use
of open source libraries that are themselves very portable (SDL, OpenAL, libpython, zlib).
Without an open development model and supporting infrastructure, the project would have
never succeeded.</p>

<p>The engine can be used to play the full Baldur’s Gate saga, the first Icewind Dale and
Planescape: Torment. The latter requires more reverse engineering and polishing, but
one can finish the game already. Icewind Dale 2 is a different matter — while it
appears more polished than Torment, only the first two chapters of the game are
playable.</p>

<p>As GemRB marks its 20th anniversary, Jaka Kranjc, the current maintainer, is optimistic about
the project’s future. <em>“Our work is not finished, but this sort of thing is like an
ultramarathon — for most of the run the goal is not within reach. Companies come and go, but
FLOSS persists!”</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://gemrb.org/2020/08/24/gemrb-0-8-7-released.html">new release</a>
brings over 500 changes manifested as bugfixes, smaller features, cleanups
and an improved setup experience. More than that, it introduces a new <a href="https://gemrb.org/2020/07/16/new-pathfinder-smarter-movement.html">smarter
pathfinder</a> with
bumping support and other movement related improvements. At the same time work continued
on the drawing and GUI handling rewrite — stay tuned for a deeper dive later this week.
With this anniversary release out of the way, finishing that rewrite is again the team’s
main priority.</p>

<p>Overall it’s clear that after all this time the GemRB effort is still active, slowly building
missing pieces of the Infinity Engine mosaic, revitalising older code, extending features and
working throughout the project to keep the effort vibrant for years to come. The team is
looking for <a href="https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">new contributors</a>,
especially programmers with OpenGL experience, who could help them finish a drawing backend
refactoring — for better performance and to remain available on a wide berth of platforms.</p>

<p>A pearl to you!</p>

<p><em>This article is part of a </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>series on managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Making the switch to managing managers, and hence managing many teams, can be taxing on the brain. If you’ve not done it before, then you may look at others in more senior roles, potentially running organizations of hundreds of people, and wonder to yourself how they ever find any clock time or mental time for getting anything done.</p>



<p>If you’re used to running one team, that’s a reasonable thought to have. After all, running a team is a tough job. It involves balancing your time between managing others and making your own contributions, working with people outside of your team, deeply understanding the personalities and desires of your staff, and, of course, let’s not forget the most important thing: shipping software.</p>



<p>When viewed through this lens, the thought of having multiple teams may seem quite overwhelming. How are you meant to carry everything in your head that you did before, but at many times the scale? Well, the answer is that you <em>shouldn’t have to</em>. That’s exactly why you have managers reporting to you, which allows you to work at a higher level of abstraction.</p>



<p>Working at this higher level of abstraction allows you to focus your efforts on what’s important; whether that importance manifests in the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/vp-director-what/">operational running of work streams or strategic planning for the future</a>. It allows you to step back and to focus your energy where it pays the greatest dividends: the outputs of tens, if not hundreds, of people.</p>



<p>Since those that read this website typically have a background in writing software, I’ll lean on a software engineering analogy in order to explain how you use your managers to work at this higher level of abstraction. We’re going to be looking at the interface between yourself and your managers by looking at, erm, <strong>interfaces</strong>. How handy.</p>



<h2>Interfaces</h2>



<p>The programming language that I have the most experience in is Java, so I’m going to lean on it for this particular analogy. An interface in Java, like in other languages, is a type that allows you to define abstract methods that other classes must have if they implement that interface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for example, you may define an interface for a CurseGenerator:</p>



<pre><code>interface CurseGenerator {
  public String curse();
}</code></pre>



<p>Of which we could then implement a British version:</p>



<pre><code>public class BritishCurseGenerator implements CurseGenerator {
  public String curse() {
    return “Oh, bloody hell!”;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>An interface allows extensibility in software systems because a particular piece of code can work with any class that implements a given interface, since the interface’s methods are checked to be present in the implementing class at compilation time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly,&nbsp;the code that works with an interface <em>does not need to know the details of the implementation</em>.<em> </em>The implementing class can do whatever it wants as long as it abides by the contract of the method signatures. The interface <em>delegates </em>the implementation to the implementing class. </p>



<p>Do you see where this is going? I’m sure you do. Back to the management analogy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>As a manager of managers, you define what the interface that represents each of your teams looks like.</strong> For example, you may define particular measurements that are important, such as KPIs like application uptime, daily active users, and so on. You may also require that your managers hold weekly one to ones with each of their staff, write a report on progress to the rest of the company every two weeks, or to fix critical priority bugs in one business day.</li><li><strong>Each of your managers has the flexibility of deciding exactly how those teams are run, as long as they follow the interface contract.</strong> So the way in which they decide to tackle improving the uptime percentage or the number of daily active users is entirely up to them. Which member staff works on which part of the codebase is down to them and the team. How and when they schedule their one-to-ones and the content that they discuss is for them to decide. But fundamentally, they should be done to abide by the contract of the interface.</li></ul>



<p>Clear interfaces allow you to not have to worry about the exact implementation details of how each of your managers run their teams, but they allow you to make it clear <em>exactly what you expect of each of them in doing so, and therefore how you define success</em>. OK, I’ll stop the programming analogy now.</p>



<h2>Defining the interface</h2>



<p>So you start by defining that interface with each of your managers. There’s a neat exercise for your first one-to-one meetings (although you can do it at any time) called <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/contracting/">Contracting, that I’ve written about before</a>. You can expand on that Contracting exercise by having you both think about the answers to the following questions, which make up the interface:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What success looks like for the team.</strong> What measurements are being used to prove that the team is being successful? Is it working towards an outcome, or some KPI, or shipping particular projects on time? Does it also take into account the happiness, productiveness and psychological security of their staff? How will this information be gathered and made accessible to you?</li><li><strong>Which processes will be used to run the team.</strong> In order to be successful, how are they going to compose themselves? Will they use scrum, kanban, just get on with it, or something else? How do they intend to ship to production regularly? How will they prioritize and execute on their work? Each team of yours may operate differently depending on the skills and seniority of the people on each.</li><li><strong>How the manager interfaces with each of their own staff.</strong> They’ll need to think about the different personalities, skills and career development trajectories for each of their staff and consider what that means for how each of them can operate with autonomy, mastery and purpose. What is an acceptable cadence for one-to-ones? Do they prefer synchronous or asynchronous communication?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>How will you know if something is going wrong? </strong>Code throws errors or performs slowly, bringing problems to your attention. How will issues with the team be made visible so you can work on them together?</li><li><strong>Whether you’d occasionally like to inspect the implementation yourself.</strong> Although defining an interface is meant to hide the complexity from you, occasionally it’s interesting to look under the hood and see what’s going on there. You might have some suggestions to make it better, or you may even learn something new. You can arrange a cadence for skip-level meetings, occasionally pop-up in their group meetings to listen, and get feedback from the individuals and the team as a whole.</li></ul>



<p>With a little work up front on the interface, you can make it absolutely clear at what level of involvement you both feel comfortable with having in your relationship. This allows you to abstract away from issues you don’t need to know about as a manager of managers, and gives your direct report the freedom to run the team how they want, as long as the fundamentals that you expect are being implemented. And that’s great, because you can build a great coaching relationship from that foundation, rather than being at risk of micromanaging or firing and forgetting.</p>



<h2>Debugging problems</h2>



<p>Occasionally things will go wrong, as they do in code. You may need to get the debugger out to see what’s going on. But that’s OK, since you’ve already discussed the interface between you, your direct report, and their team. That interface gives you a number of methods to attach your debugger to.</p>



<p>Perhaps if the team’s cadence is slowing down, you can dig deeper into the processes that are being used to run the team. How often are they shipping? If that’s not very often, why is that? How does code get written, reviewed and deployed? You can keep <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/first-principles-and-asking-why/">asking why</a> in order to get to the bottom of quirks that might be bugs. And then you can fix them together.</p>



<p>Sometimes it’s interesting to attach the debugger out of pure curiosity. You can do this in your one-to-ones with your direct report. Focus on one area of your interface and go deep into the implementation by asking questions. You’ll always find something worth discussing, and often there’s some neat performance optimizations to try out.</p>



<h2>Beginning with the end in mind</h2>



<p>So why have interfaces?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideal end state is that you have clear expectations and boundaries between yourself and the managers that are reporting into you. When you’ve made it clear which high-level functions that each of your managers should be performing, you can delegate the implementation to them so they can do so in whichever way they feel is best for them and their team.</p>



<p>This allows you to move away from details that you don’t need to spend your time focussing on, enabling you to work at a higher level of abstraction. If you were programming, this abstraction would allow you to concentrate on making the system surrounding the interface more efficient, extensible, performant and elegant. That’s exactly what you’ll be wanting to do with the organization, structure and strategic direction of teams as well.</p>

<h3>Or: Why Javascript Developers are Often Marxists</h3>



<p>We’ve all heard the idea of the tragedy of the commons: the idea that when nobody has an incentive to maintain a shared resource, everyone following their own incentives causes the demise of the shared resource. A typical example given here is a pasture in which sheep graze. If everyone limits the amount their sheep consume, then the pasture has enough for everyone. Since feeding your own sheep more than everyone else allows your sheep to produce more wool and baby sheep, there is an incentive for people to overgraze their own sheep, leading to the destruction of the pasture.</p>



<div><p>Ostensibly, private property solves this problem by giving someone both an incentive, and ability, to maintain the pasture.  Inherent here is the idea of scarcity and maintenance.  How important are they? If we imagined a pasture that didn’t need to be maintained, and couldn’t be overgrazed, would the tragedy of the commons still apply?</p><p> Perhaps counter-intuitively, I think the answer is “yes”.&nbsp; I believe public (i.e. unowned) resources end up having the same problems as shared, mutable, global state: maintaining invariants becomes impossible.&nbsp; Thus, in addition to creating incentives, private property acts as something like a form of concurrency control. Legal ownership fulfills a similar function as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">mutex</a>: it allows for a single intended use to play out entirely, rather than having some resource continually thrashing between various use cases, and ultimately producing nothing.</p></div>



<p>When people ask me to imagine a world without private ownership, I immediately start running into practical problems. Let’s say I want to use a giant warehouse for an indoor waterpark, and someone else wants to use the same giant warehouse for a paintball obstacle course.&nbsp; How do we resolve the conflict between the two of us?&nbsp; In a world with private ownership, the conflict is resolved by whoever owns the property making the decision, and a system of courts and law enforcement creating incentives for people to respect that decision.</p>



<div><p>Producing anything of long term value usually requires some form of investment; a period of time in which state is being manipulated just so, and yet no value has been created. Only after state has been arranged just right, is the value created.  While people build a house, it’s completely unusable.  The work that is done is only valuable if the house can be completed. </p><p>If a house is mostly built, and a hurricane blows it away before anyone can live inside, was any value really created?</p></div>



<div><p>Private property as an institution allows one algorithm to take as long as it wants to manipulate state in order to produce some value. Absent this mechanism, I don’t know how any long term value could be created.&nbsp; If someone else can take the crops after I’ve planted them, watered them, and tended them, whatever purpose they have might be supplanted by <em>another </em>party coming to take the item from them. </p><p>Even if you get rid of incentives and imagine we are all driven fully by the public good, we all have different notions of what that means. Multiple threads in the same processor aren’t tripping each other up due to incentives; it isn’t that one thread says “you know I’d like to write a value to this hash table, but I’m concerned that other thread will replace one of the pointers in the bucket, so instead I just won’t bother.”  The two threads just go about their work, and the result is that the program crashes or produces incorrect results.</p></div>



<p>In a world without private ownership, I don’t know what prevents that same kind of thrashing.&nbsp; Making a functioning world economy without private ownership sounds like trying to manage a giant multithreaded computer system without any concurrency or synchronization primitives: a recipe for wasted effort.</p>



<p>Maybe the problem with having a public pasture isn’t<em> just </em>that one shepherd might have their sheep eat so much grass that the roots are gone and nothing can grow back. Maybe there’s <em>also </em>category of problems where one shepherd might be attempting to have their sheep arranged in a red-black tree, and some other shepherd wanted to use the space to encode lookup tables for a compression algorithm, and as a result, nobody managed to get their computing done and all of those cycles were wasted.</p>



<h3>Conflicts Lead to Massive Waste</h3>



<p>Speaking of waste, everyone on the internet agrees that arguing on the internet is a huge waste of time. You know what else is an even <em>bigger </em>waste of time? How about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period">centuries of chaotic warfare</a> that make any form of long term investment impossible?&nbsp; Or, perhaps, how about getting <a href="https://apxhard.com/2020/07/27/ethical-systems-as-computational-optimizations/">angry and yelling at your spouse</a>? That’s a waste of time too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these problems are fixed by strictly adhering to explicit social hierarchies.&nbsp; Of course, there are <em>other </em>problems with those, but I think few people alive today realize the benefits that explicit hierarchies have in terms of mitigating conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think if we want a society free of hierarchies, we need to understand the problems these hierarchies are solving. Otherwise, we’ll probably just create a new set of hierarchies while claiming we are doing something fundamentally different. Hierarchies are one extremely simple way of solving concurrency problems. If those problems continue to exist, it’s likely we’ll stumble into ‘new’ solutions that are identical to the old ones.</p>



<p>Any human relationship presents an ongoing stream of concurrency problems. People often have conflicting wants and needs.&nbsp; The work of maintaining a relationship includes identifying these conflicts and rectifying them.</p>



<p>I can reduce the likelihood of fighting with my wife by adopting the simple, explicitly hierarchical maximum that if we ever argue, she is always right and I am always wrong. Thinking this way made my ego squirm a little bit, but once I let go of that and just accepted that it never helps us to fight,&nbsp; I found that there is actually a kind of peace that comes from submitting completely to a source that you love and trust and know has your best interest at heart. When I think of friends whose judgement I trust, and who I know love me, there’s a kind of illicit thrill that comes with the idea of completely and totally surrendering to something that dominates you as it protects you.</p>



<p>From a concurrency control mechanism, there isn’t really a difference between “the duke obeys the king, and the lord obeys the duke”, and a protocol which assigns numeric values to locks, and says you can only pick up new locks if you go <em>down </em>the hierarchy.</p>



<p>It’s not at all hard to imagine why people like the idea of ‘the good king.’ If you pin me down, really hold me tight, hug me and tell me you’ll keep me safe, and ask “would you rather have the ability to vote for one of two sociopaths who claims to represent you, or have me, your lawful king protect you,” I know which way <em>my </em>limbic system would vote. The rational mind says “give me agency and the ability to navigate this reality as i see fit”, but the pack animal longs for a strong, just alpha to be both a source of protection and a sink for admiration.</p>



<p>Thus, the King acts like a global mutex over all states. If you’re a meme such as the Helix Fossil, and you want to instantiate yourself all over the domain, you’ll need to grab control over the ‘King’ mutex first.&nbsp; Once you have this ‘King’ mutex locked up, you can grab control over the ‘Duke’ and ‘Baron’ mutexes as needed, to levy your taxes, raise your workforce, and ultimately construct glorious statues in your likelihood. All praise <a href="https://twitchplayswiki.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Helix">Lord Helix</a>!</p>



<p>However, If you try to acquire these mutexes in the reverse order, Bad Things are likely to happen to you, and the computing domain’s anti-viral mechanism (aka local clergy) will deem you to be heretical and you’ll be relegated to executing as a background thread in the underground economy.</p>



<h4>War and Deadlock</h4>



<p>We might view periods of social unrest in strictly hierarchical societies as being something like periods of deadlock in a concurrency system.&nbsp; Instead of making forward progress on committing transactions (i.e. continuing the business of keeping the kingdom alive and healthy) conflicts between the nobility can consume massive amounts of resources, both raw material and human lives.&nbsp; In a similar fashion, a poorly managed concurrent system will grab lots of memory and CPU cycles, without producing any useful work.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Of course, in the total <em>absence </em>of any hierarchy in society, you might see the same kinds of conflicts playing out, just at a much smaller scale: if people can steal and loot with impunity, we wouldn’t they?&nbsp; </p><p>This interplay between conflict-resolution structures both alleviating and leading to conflict leads us to what look like different forces that reach different equilibria in different geopolitical phases.</p><p>Smaller scale concurrency problems between tribes lead to the creation of states and governments; large scale concurrency problems between states and governments lead to the breakdown of those states and governments, and a resurgence of tribal power. We might see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> as being something like a temporary patch over the distributed human operating system; the idea of nation states took a while for people to figure out how to hack, but they got it eventually – and that’s what we’re watching now, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@MarkPXuNeyer/pocket-jacks-one-night-in-las-vegas-96a7ebc14936">Trump</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jair_Bolsonaro">Bolsonaro</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb%C3%A1n">Orbán</a>.&nbsp; The global operating system is involved in a massive case of deadlock, leading to starvation, a slowdown in global productivity growth and thus a resurgence in tribalism.</p></div>



<div><p>The tradeoffs between a globalized economy and a patchwork of nationalism look a lot like tradeoffs involved in designing dataflows on a massively multicore system.&nbsp;</p><p>When you have a small number of processors, and plenty of chip-memory bandwidth, nationalism is less effective than globalized trade. &nbsp; Having an operating system running on a single core, and delegating work to …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

as an excuse to look into older computers, because <em>nostalgics</em>.</p>

<p>Besides that, I am a fan of clicky keyboards. I have a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4C-ultimate/">DasKeyboard 4C ultimate</a> tenkeyless with Cherry Blue switches and a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4C-tenkeyless-professional/">4C Profressional</a> with brown switches. Sitting at home during the
corona period, made me google old skool stuff a lot.</p>
<p>So first I laid my eyes on a <a href="https://clickykeyboards.com/product/ibm-model-m2-1395300-made-by-ibm-06-30-1993/">IBM Model M2</a> and got this pretty cheap on
the dutch eBay. Getting this to work on my modern laptop was not rocket science, but not straight forward either. I warned my collegues
that the quiet days at the office were over. But this also opened up a window into vintage computers and computing. What if I could get a vintage computer, I thought. How awesome would that be?</p>
<p>How cool would it be to program a vintage computer with my collegues, or my kids. With all the speed we get nowadays, who still thinks about the limits of computing power. This will be totally different if you have just a fraction of the memory and chip available.</p>
<h2 id="ibm-5160">IBM 5160</h2>
<p>I am from 1983. So I was looking for a computer from that year. IBM was <em>the company</em> in those days for personal computing and when it came to makeing PC’s (I am NOT an apple fan). So I found that IBM produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT"><strong>IBM PC XT</strong></a> in that year. I also found out that you could still get them online for a reasonable price.
Luckliy I was able to lay my hands on one, in a pretty good state. It came with an <a href="https://clickykeyboards.com/product-category/1986-1989-ibm-model-m-silver-label/">IBM Model M</a> keyboard with the silver label (the PC is from 1986). The sound of that is even better than than the <code>Model M2</code>.</p>

<p>After introducing my kids to th <code>DIR</code> command (it was the only one I was pretty sure about it would work), they wanted to type “words” on the old computer (first success).</p>
<h2 id="exiting-vim-is-hard">Exiting Vim is hard?</h2>
<p>So, I know the <code>DIR</code> command. But now what. Let’s see what commands are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>No tab completion. <code>TAB</code> just places the cursor somewhere down the line</li>
<li>No <code>HISTORY</code>. You can repeat the last command by pressing the right-arrow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. You say that you have IBM PC DOS 5. If so, this includes the DOSKEY command. This will give you a command-line history with editing. Just type <code>dos\doskey</code> to load it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a starters, on <code>IBM DOS</code> (version 5.0) there is no <code>$PATH</code>. The executables are located in <code>C:\DOS</code> (or <code>c:\dos</code>, because <code>DOS</code> don’t care about casing). the most executables are located. After a day or two I figured this out, so I finally managed to open my first <code>BASIC</code> program. All fine, until I wanted to quit the program. It’s not that easy as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">exiting <code>Vim</code></a>. It took me quite some time googling, until I finally found this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44253055/how-can-i-exit-microsoft-gw-basic-ibm-basica-or-other-similar-old-dialects-of">lifesaver</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There certainly should be! DOS has 2 configuration files, which live in the root directory of the boot drive (A: or C:). They are called [1] CONFIG.SYS and [2] AUTOEXEC.BAT. In the 2nd, there should be a line:
<code>PATH=C:\DOS; C:\</code></p>

<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is <em>not</em> <code>QBASIC</code>; <code>QBASIC</code> has a GUI. You were in either <code>BASICA</code> or <code>GWBASIC</code>. The command to quit is <code>syst em</code>, if I remember correctly after 30 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, now I can start a few commands, but getting all available commands is not that straight forward. There is a lot in the <code>DOS</code> directory, but there is no scrolling, and the monitor only is 25 lines.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes there is [scrolling]. Type <code>dir /p</code> for page-by-page. <code>dir /w</code> gives a wide listing. You can combine these: <code>dir /w /p</code>. You can also do <code>dir | more</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[the monitor is only 25 lines] This depends on the graphics card. If you have an MDA card, no, 25 lines is all. Try <code>mode con: lines=43</code> or <code>mode con: lines=50</code>. This will only work on a VGA-compatible card, though, and you will need ANSI.SYS installed, I think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So figuring out the available commands is using a lot of <code>DIR *.EXE</code>'s and <code>DIR *.COM</code>'s.</p>
<p>First class fun.</p>

<p>Not so long ago I was explaining my collegue (who is using a screensaver), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screensaver">where a screensaver got its name from</a>. Back in the days, when we were all running the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzx9ArZ7MUU">pipes</a> so the screen would not <span>fuck up</span>

<p>But now, sit back and relax…</p>

<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It [wppreview] is not part of DOS. Sounds like a WordPerfect preview program for use with mailmerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>So far I had to explain to my son what a <code>file(name)</code> and a <code>command</code> is (when they were typing “words” the IBM kept returning</p>
<p>So the experience is already educational :)</p>
<p>To be honest, I do not have a clear idea what I am going to do with it next. I will be playing with it for a while like an 8 year old with his trains.
After the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stayathome"><code>#stayathome</code></a> is over, hopefully I can take it to the office, so we can start doing real cool things with it.</p>
<p>I will definitely have to up my <a href="https://www.qb64.org/wiki/GOTO"><code>GOTO</code></a> skills :)</p>
<p>I will start using my Model M2 for work (sorry collegues), for sure. I will have to remap my function key in <a href="https://i3wm.org/"><code>i3</code></a>, because I am currently using the
windows key for this. But the Model M2 does not have one. But I will overcome.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to remap CapsLock to be a “Windows” (Super) key. This is how I use my IBM Model M in Linux. I suggest <code>xmodmap</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides that, I found this great archive with <a href="ihttps://archive.org/search.php?query=dos%20ibm">manuals</a> and <a href="http://www.retroarchive.org/dos/disks/">bootdisks</a> and even <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/40c2a543-4218-c39a-11c3-a4e284a2c3a5">PC DOS 5.02</a>. Currently I am trying to get a VM up running PC DOS 5.0 (yes, that is possible in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfjUkJMe_kw">virtualbox</a>)</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are willing to change the DOS version, I suggest DR DOS 3.41. The reason is this: MS/PC DOS 5, 6 &amp; later are designed for 386 memory management. This is impossible on an 8088 chip, and as a result, you will have very little free memory. Many DOS programs won’t work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DR-DOS is a better 3rd party clone of DOS, by the company that wrote the original OS (CP/M) that MS-DOS was ripped-off from. The first version is 3.41 (before that it had different names) and it is far more memory-efficient. <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/dr-dos/3x">https://winworldpc.com/product/dr-dos/3x</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you want to stay with an IBM original DOS, then IBM developed PC DOS all the way to version 7.1, which supports EIDE hard disks over 8GB, FAT32 and some other nice features. It is a free download.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have described how to get it here: <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/59703.html">https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/59703.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PC DOS 7 is a bit strange; IBM removed Microsoft’s GUI editor and replaced it with an OS/2-derived one called E, which has a weird UI. IBM also removed GWBASIC and replaced it with the Rexx scripting language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I combine bits of PC-DOS 7.1 with Microsoft’s editor, Microsoft’s diagnostics, Scandisk disk-repair tool and some other bits, but that is more than I can cover in a comment!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a lot you can do to upgrade a 5160 if you wish. Here is a crazy example: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/misterzeropage/">https://sites.google.com/site/misterzeropage/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would not go that far, but a VGA card, VGA CRT, a serial mouse and an XTIDE card with a CF card in it, and it would be a lot easier to use…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The downside, my Cherry MX blue switches feel like second class now.</p>
<h2 id="update">UPDATE</h2>
<p>When I was installing my VM with <code>PC DOS</code>, at the end of the installation I was aske if I wanted to start in <code>shell</code> mode. It turns out there is a command <code>DOSSHELL</code> (needs to be executed fron <code>C:\DOS</code>) which gives you a very fancy
gui.</p>

<p>The greatest common divisor is something I learned in school but it was one of those “so what?” subjects. But recently I revisited it and it is very interesting.</p>



<p><strong>Why is gcd cool?</strong></p>



<p>Every number, can be expressed as the product of prime numbers. This product for every number is unique; sort of like saying, every number has a fingerprint. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>. 36 is <code>4x9</code>, and 45 is <code>5x9</code>. This means that some numbers will have common parts with each other.</p>



<p>These common parts can divide both numbers, and thus they are common divisors. In the example above, 36 is <code>4x9</code> or <code>2x2x3x3</code>, while 45 is <code>5x3x3</code>; 3 is a common divisor of both, so is <code>3x3</code>, which is 9; but 9 is the greatest divisor of both 36 and 45.</p>



<p>One question I had when I was younger, was why we are talking about the “greatest” and not the smallest common divisor. We could, but soon, this gets boring: there is 1, the smallest common divisor of every number, then there are some common divisors in between 1 and the gcd. But what the gcd does so uniquely, is that it takes two numbers and gives us <em>all</em> the common parts of two numbers. </p>

The gcd of 36 and 45 is 9.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is cool! The uncommon parts are relatively prime! — meaning, they have nothing in common but the number 1. </p>



<p>So to find the gcd, then, we need to find all the common parts of the two numbers when written in terms of their prime factors. </p>



<p><code>36=3x3x2x2</code> and <code>45=3x3x5</code>, thus the gcd of 36 and 45 is <code>3x3</code>, which is 9. So 36 is 9(4) and 45 is 9(5). It is very interesting to look at numbers as multiples of gcds. Moreover, notice that these multipliers, 4 and 5 in the example above, are relatively prime. </p>



<p><strong>The magic of subtraction</strong></p>



<p>Subtracting two relatively prime numbers, will produce another number that, while not necessarily prime itself, will be relatively prime to both the previous numbers. As an example, <code>13-7=6</code>. 6 is not prime, but it is relatively prime to both 7 and 13. If we subtract 6 from 13 we will get 7 again which is not very interesting. But if we subtract 6 from 7, the smaller one, since 6 and 7 are relatively prime we should get another number that is relatively prime to them both; <code>7-6=1</code>, which is relatively prime to every other number, if keep doing this:</p>


<pre title="">13 -  7 = 6
7  -  6 = 1
6  -  1 = 5
5  -  1 = 4
4  -  1 = 3
3  -  1 = 2
2  -  1 = 1
1  -  1 = 0

(1, 0)
</pre>


<p>The final two numbers are 0 and 1. So whenever we start with two relatively prime numbers and do this on them, it will always end with 0 and 1. This is pretty strange and magical. I am still perplexed by it, but the way I convinced myself, is to think about it bottom up: if we start with the number 1, and try to build our way to any other number by addition, there are finite number of ways. So when we start subtracting, what we are doing is walking that path backwards towards 1. </p>

<p>Now why do these two numbers need to be relatively prime? because if they are not relatively prime, that means that they have some parts in common, like 36 and 45 above, remember? they are 9(4) and 9(5). If we do the subtracting trick on them:</p>


<pre title="">9(5) - 9(4) = 9(1)
9(4) - 9(1) = 9(3)
9(3) - 9(1) = 9(2)
9(2) - 9(1) = 9(1)
9(1) - 9(1) = 9(0)

(9(1), 0)
</pre>


<p>So you see, the common part survives the subtractions, while the uncommon parts converge to 1. But 9 is <em>all</em> the common parts of 36 and 45, in other words the gcd of 36 and 45! </p>



<p>Can we keep subtracting any two numbers until we reach (X, 0) and then proclaim X is the greatest common divisor? yes, we can, and it is called the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidean Algorithm</a></em>.</p>



<p>Here is a silly experiment, what if we subtract the partially common parts? for 36 and 45, what if we wrote them as 3(12) and 3(15)?</p>


<pre title="">3(15) -  3(12) = 3(3)
3(12) -  3(3)  = 3(9)
3(9)  -  3(3)  = 3(6)
3(6)  -  3(3)  = 3(3)
3(3)  -  3(3)  = 3(0)

(3(3), 0)
</pre>


<p>This is really funny. The algorithm basically told us that the gcd of 12 and 15 is 3. Now if we choose to multiply the other 3 that we have factored out before we started our subtraction, it will yield the same result: the gcd of 36 and 45 is 9.</p>



<p><strong>What just happened?</strong></p>



<p>We started by finding the gcd of two numbers, then subtracting the uncommon, relatively prime parts to realize we always reach 1, so if we always subtract any two numbers from each other repeatedly, since the gcd is a common factor of both, it will remain constant until the end, when the uncommon parts have reduced down to 1 and 0; and then what we are left with is the gcd. </p>



<p>Here is a recursive implementation of it in Python:</p>


<pre title="">def gcd(a,b):
    if a == 0: return b
    if b == 0: return a

    return gcd(abs(a-b), min(a,b))
</pre>


<p>If someone has a better explanation of why subtracting relatively prime numbers repeatedly will always result in one, please leave a comment or reach out and help me understand better.</p>

                        This is the eleventh in a series of <a href="https://www.magicsplat.com/blog/tags/tcl-8-7/">posts</a> about new features in the upcoming version 8.7 of Tcl. It is the first of a pair of posts describing core support for treating ZIP archives as virtual file systems within Tcl. This post focuses on base operations dealing with existing ZIP archives. The next describes the creation of ZIP archives and their use for building <em>zipkits</em> and single file executables.

                    <p>
                        With Tcl 8.6, access to files in ZIP archives was already possible. Tcl itself offered the ability to compress and decompress data with the <code>zlib</code> command. The <code>zipfile</code> module in <code>tcllib</code> then made use of these to permit access to files within an archive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tcl 8.7 goes beyond these capabilities by treating ZIP archives as mountable <em>virtual file systems</em> (VFS). This makes access to the files within the archive much simpler through the standard Tcl channel commands <code>open</code>, <code>gets</code> etc.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Mounting ZIP archives
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The first step to accessing ZIP archives is to mount them as a Tcl VFS. This is done with the <code>zipfs mount</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs mount mnt demo.zip</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This results in the archive <code>demo.zip</code> being mounted as a VFS under the path <code>zipfs:/mnt</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The root of all ZIP file systems is given by the <code>zipfs root</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs root
zipfs:/</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This root is platform-specific, <code>zipfs:/</code> on Windows and <code>//zipfs:/</code> on Unix(y) systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, you can mount multiple archives or even the same archive multiple times. The mount points of course have to be different but one can be nested inside another. For example,
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs mount mnt2 demo.zip
% zipfs mount mnt/nested demo2.zip</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Invoking <code>zipfs mount</code> without any arguments will return the currently mounted ZIP archives as a flat list of mount points and the archive file path.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs mount
zipfs:/mnt demo.zip zipfs:/mnt/nested demo2.zip zipfs:/mnt2 demo.zip</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        ZIP archives may be protected with a password. In that case the password must be supplied as the last argument to the command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When no longer needed the each VFS should be unmounted with <code>zipfs unmount</code>.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs unmount mnt2
% zipfs unmount mnt/nested
% zipfs mount
zipfs:/mnt demo.zip</code></pre>

                        Introspecting archives
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Once mounted, the archives can be introspected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>zipfs list</code> command returns a list of the files in the ZIP file system. Optionally, regular expression or glob wildcard patterns may be specified to filter the returned paths.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs list
zipfs:/mnt/demo zipfs:/mnt zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir/file.txt zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
% zipfs list *.txt
zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir/file.txt zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
% zipfs list -glob *.txt
zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir/file.txt zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
% zipfs list -regexp {\.txt$}
zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir/file.txt zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Notice there is no mount point specified above. The command lists all files and directories under the ZIP VFS root. To restrict to a specific archive, specify it as a pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar command returns a list of all file paths under a specific directory.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs find zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir
zipfs:/mnt/demo/subdir/file.txt</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        <strong>TIP:</strong> The <code>zipfs find</code> command will work with any file system, not just ZIP VFS'es.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the ZIP archive is mounted as a Tcl VFS, standard Tcl commands for retrieving generic file information can be used. For example,
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% file size zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
12
% clock format [file atime zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt]
Sun Aug 23 12:33:24 IST 2020</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The <code>zipfs info</code> command returns additional information that is specific to the ZIP archive format.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% zipfs info zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt
demo.zip 12 14 50</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The returned list contains the name of the ZIP archive (as originally passed), the original file size, the compressed file size and the offset of the file's compressed data within the ZIP archive. (As an aside, note in our example that the "compressed" size is greater than the actual size as often happens for small files.)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Data transfer from compressed files in the archive is achieved through the standard Tcl channel I/O commands.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% set chan [open zipfs:/mnt/demo/demo.txt]
zipfs_32_1
% gets $chan
Demo file 
% close $chan</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        You can also open the file for writing. However, the ZIP VFS does not support the append mode.
                    </p>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>After a year or two of effort I've produced something I believe structurally improves both software development and the developed software. I am, however, neither salesman nor entrepreneur born and have already explored all the options I know for commercializing this work. As no crisis should ever go to waste, job hunting during one of the ...less ideal... times in recent history gives me an opportunity to demonstrate the nature of the tool I've produced. So without further ado, let me introduce acorn.
</p><p>In short, acorn is a design and documentation tool that generates functioning software systems. The central premise of this low-code platform is declarative specification of the language-agnostic elements of a back-end system. Domain-driven design is leveraged to create a common language shared by engineers, business analysts, and domain experts, while acorn avoids the trap of turning business analysts into programmers by ensuring any imperative programming is implemented using industry standard tooling. The core DNA of the tool is maturity by default without the associated lock-in of proprietary hosting or custom programming languages. This section of the wiki both explains and embodies the tool itself, so read on if I've captured your attention. Less detail can be found <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wiki.squirreltechnologies.nz/">here</a>.
</p>
<h3><span id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>Right off the bat - let's be clear. I didn't come up through software, though I have fond memories of making games on my graphics calculator in math class in school. Instead, my pedigree starts with mechanical engineering, a segue through biomedical engineering for a Ph.D, and finally analysis/data science to round out my little path-less-travelled. The common thread? Using my rudimentary mathematical skills to understand and influence the world around me. The fundamental issue at hand? You <b>need</b> software to make that happen.
</p><p>Either software systems produce the data you rely on, or software systems are required to implement the outcomes. Both, as it happens, is the more likely scenario, and I rapidly found myself frustrated with the state of the software world. When presented with a new and complex domain, I want to understand:
</p>
<ul><li>What data exists within the system, and what it means</li>
<li>How you can interact with that data</li>
<li>The pedigree of that data, and how it has evolved over time</li></ul>
<p>In practice, that means attempting to digest 15 years of messy development of an organically grown system. Reading code, spelunking outdated wikis, interpreting artistic architectural diagrams that boil down to a single individual's mental model, and generally hoping that the assumptions you make are safe enough for you to rely on your own analysis. The final straw was how fraught it was to actually evolve these bespoke organic systems.
</p><p>I tried to learn the professional lessons of the engineers around me that I respected, and so my journey towards acorn began.
</p>
<h2><span id="Key_concepts">Key concepts</span></h2>
<p>Before I continue on, there a few concepts that set the scene. First, acorn sees three important archetypes relevant to the development of software:
</p>
<ol><li>Experts: Knowledgeable about the domain, perhaps non-technical</li>
<li>Engineers: The ones who make it happen, perhaps despite not knowing what <i>it</i> is to begin with</li>
<li>E... Users: Anybody who relies on the resulting system, from non-technical users to external engineers</li></ol>
<p>You management types keep the world from descending into chaos&nbsp;:) but these three groups need to communicate clearly for the process to be successful. As good fences make good neighbours there are three levels of formality of data access required by these groups:
</p>
<ol><li>External: Highly formal contracts that have consequences when they change because external parties rely on them [Users, Experts, Engineers]</li>
<li>Internal: Formal, but manageable boundaries that different sections of your organization build upon [Experts, Engineers]</li>
<li>Private: Flexible boundaries enforced by a team on themselves purely for data consistency and ergonomic reasons [Engineers]</li></ol>
<p>Why do these two concepts matter? Because acorn is a tool that enables those three archetypes to collaborate, and to build software that requires no extra effort to maintain the different formality levels required for safe, productive development work. Keep these concepts in mind as a lens through which to understand the meta tool that follows.
</p>
<h2><span id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>My non-traditional route makes for non-traditional nomenclature, so this section should help explain what I mean by the terms I use for acorn's meta model of a software system.
</p>
<h3><span id="General_terms">General terms</span></h3>
<dl><dt>library</dt>
<dd>A software system that has been designed to be embedded in other systems, as opposed to run as a stand-alone entity</dd>
<dt>module</dt>
<dd>What you get when you wrap enough extra detail around a library such that it can be deployed</dd>
<dt>project</dt>
<dd>The design for a library/module along with its documentation and implementation</dd>
<dt>realm</dt>
<dd>Individual components within a project</dd></dl>
<p>Thus acorn is a tool that allows you create software projects while writing perhaps 20% of the normally required lines of back-end code. These projects are standardized to allow them to be embedded (for libraries) or connected (modules) in a modular fashion. This connection could be realized as either a microservice, monolithic, or function-as-a-service deployment model. These projects themselves consist of realms, where each realm is a bounded context in domain-driven design terminology, and could be individually owned by different teams if such scale is called for.
</p>
<h3><span id="Data-specific_terms">Data-specific terms</span></h3>
<dl><dt>primitive</dt>
<dd>The basic form of data within a system, everything from raw binary information to free text or dates</dd>
<dt>data type</dt>
<dd>An envelope of data containing perhaps many fields containing either primitives or other data types</dd>
<dt>event</dt>
<dd>A meaningful occurrence within the system, represented as a data type that is published under specific conditions</dd>
<dt>subscription</dt>
<dd>An asynchronous process that listens for specific events and allows a system to respond to changes</dd>
<dt>regular expression</dt>
<dd>a custom primitive with a specified pattern</dd>
<dt>lookup</dt>
<dd>a custom primitive that can take on a specific set of values that are defined at runtime</dd></dl>
<p>Thus acorn is a tool for creating data-intensive applications, where an application can be seen as a graph of primitive data fields described within data types. Editing this graph produces events at differing levels of granularity, which can be leveraged to perform meaningful responses to business-relevant changes. Oh, and realms containing data are effectively mutually exclusive sections of this graph.
</p>
<h3><span id="Domain-specific_terms">Domain-specific terms</span></h3>
<p>A domain is the foundational realm within a system. It contains data, and provides an <b>internal</b> boundary for manipulating that data. There are a number of specialized concepts within a domain, and the details of the internal boundary are intended to permit standardized, flexible data access where performant, and controlled access when potentially non-performant.
</p>
<dl><dt>Aggregate root</dt>
<dd>A data type that is persisted, has a defined lifecycle, and is queriable</dd>
<dt>Entity</dt>
<dd>A named sub-graph within an aggregate root that has additional lifecycle</dd>
<dt>Command</dt>
<dd>A mutation operation that has side-effects and produces an event</dd>
<dt>Query</dt>
<dd>A read-only aggregation or transformation of data within the domain</dd></dl>
<p>Thus projects created within acorn store data in domains, where command/query responsibility segregation is utilized to provide a set of meaningful interactions with this information. The underlying principle behind acorn is that the internal boundary formed by these domains is necessary and sufficient for rapid development, exploratory analysis, and eventual extension.
</p>
<h3><span id="Portal-specific_terms">Portal-specific terms</span></h3>
<p>A portal is a realm that forms an <b>external</b> boundary for the system. Analogous to an application service in domain-driven design, portals handle inter-domain co-ordination that goes beyond pure asynchronous event subscription. Portals contain a number of specialized concepts to create a intelligible view over the use-cases of a system.
</p>
<dl><dt>Context</dt>
<dd>An externally facing set of nodes on the formal boundary of the system that share a common definition and may be associated with other contexts</dd>
<dt>View</dt>
<dd>A simple query that may belong to a context</dd>
<dt>Action</dt>
<dd>A formal mutation operation, perhaps belonging to a context, that may return enough information to navigate to a new/existing context</dd>
<dt>Navigation</dt>
<dd>Information on how to reach different contexts from the data returned by a read operation</dd>
<dt>Component</dt>
<dd>An embeddable javascript widget that supports interactions too complex for a form-based interface</dd></dl>
<p>Thus portals, while stateless, contain all the information required to make the internal boundaries of a system both legible and safe to use for external users/downstream systems. The degenerate form of a portal is simply a layer over a domain that calls aggregate roots "contexts", commands "actions", and queries "views". In other words, a typical CRUD layer over a SQL database.
</p>
<h3><span id="Engine-specific_terms">Engine-specific terms</span></h3>
<p>Domains support asynchronous processing, and portals form the boundary that initiates this processing. An engine is a realm that can co-ordinate asynchronous processing and solicit user input when required. Engines contain a number of specialized concepts to define state machines for these processes and thus simplify development of the inevitable BPMN-style flow charting and saga creation.
</p>
<dl><dt>User input</dt>
<dd>A request for additional input, represented by an action in a portal if the request cannot be automatically fulfilled</dd>
<dt>Subprocess</dt>
<dd>A logical set of background processing, starting with a command and terminating in an event after perhaps many subscriptions</dd>
<dt>Process</dt>
<dd>A…</dd></dl></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\top}A = AA^{\top} = I
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\det(I) &amp;= \det(A^{\top}A) \\
&amp;= \det(AA^{\top}) \\
&amp;= \det(A) \det(A^{\top}) \\
&amp;= \det(A) \det(A) \\
&amp;= \det(A)^2 \\
&amp;= \det(A^{\top})^2 \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\top}A A^{-1} &amp;= I A^{-1}\\
A^{\top} I &amp;= A^{-1} \\
A^{\top} &amp;= A^{-1} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger}A = AA^{\dagger} = I
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\overline{Av} &amp;= \overline{\lambda v} \\
&amp;= \overline{A} \overline{v} \\
&amp;= A \overline{v} \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda} \overline{v} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
v^{\dagger} A v &amp;= \lambda v^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{v}^{\top} A^{\top} v \\
&amp;= (A\overline{v})^{\top} v \\
&amp;= (\overline{\lambda} \overline{v})^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda}^{\top} \overline{v}^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x^{\dagger} A x &amp;= x^{\dagger} \lambda x \\
&amp;= \lambda x^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;\geq 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p><p>

\[x^{\dagger} (A^{\dagger} A) x = (Ax)^{\dagger} Ax\]

</p><p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x^{\dagger} (A^{\dagger} A) x \geq 0
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p><p>

\[A_{m \times n} = U_{m\times m} \Sigma_{m \times n} V_{n \times n}^{\dagger}\]

</p><p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger} A &amp;= (U \Sigma V^{\dagger})^{\dagger} U \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} U^{\dagger}  U \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} I \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V^{\dagger}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger} A V &amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V^{\dagger} V \\
&amp;=  V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma I \\
&amp;=  V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma \\
&amp;= \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A A^{\dagger} U &amp;= \Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger} U \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|x_i| \cos \theta &amp;= \frac{\langle x_i, w \rangle}{|w|} \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, w \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w |^2 &amp;= \langle x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w, x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \langle x_i, \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle - \langle \langle x_i, w \rangle w, x_i \rangle + \langle \langle x_i, w \rangle w, \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \langle x_i, w \rangle \langle x_i, w \rangle - \langle x_i, w \rangle \langle w, x_i \rangle + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \langle w,  w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 |w| ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle -  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{MSE}(w) &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} | x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w |^2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \big( \langle x_i, x_i \rangle -  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \big)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, …</p></div></div>

<p>In its document, the company says that the Unreal Engine is a critical engine for many developers around the world, including Microsoft itself, many of whose games for Xbox and PC are created on it.</p>



<p>Microsoft also noted that while large studios can afford to develop their own game engines, smaller teams are much more profitable to use off-the-shelf technologies like the Unreal Engine.</p>



<blockquote><p>Many indie developers don’t have the resources or ability to write their own engine. They rely entirely on third-party technologies.</p><p><br>from Microsoft statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The Epic vs. Apple standoff began on August 13 over Fortnite. The game developers added their in-game currency payment system to the applications, bypassing Apple’s service fee, after which the second removed the online action from the mobile store. Epic has filed a lawsuit against Apple, believing that the company maintains a monopoly by cutting off any competition.</p>



<p>Once submitted Apple <a href="http://nintendosmash.com/apple-has-threatened-epic-games-with-deleting-its-app-store-accounts-this-will-prevent-all-ios-apps-running-on-unreal-engine/">lawsuit</a> said of Epic, which will remove it from your system developer account August 28, depriving them of their ability to support the applications on iOS and Mac and to produce new ones.</p>



<p>This may mean that the Unreal Engine, in principle, will no longer be supported by Apple systems, and games on this engine will not be able to be released on iOS. As Epic itself says, not only they will suffer, but also many other developers who work with its engine.</p>



<p>At the same time, Microsoft has its own conflict with Apple, since it previously refused to launch iCloud on iOS. Apple explained this by the fact that such services allow you to run applications that it has not tested.</p>



<p>As for the proceedings with Epic Games, Apple said that before the conflict began, Tim Sweeney tried to achieve special conditions for his company, also mentioning that he would like the same for other companies.</p>

When surveyed again in May, during the pandemic which forced schools to shut and placed unprecedented restrictions on people’s lives, the figures dropped by nearly 10 per cent among girls to less than half (45 per cent) and to less than one in five of boys (18 per cent).</p><p>“With the whole world in the grip of a devastating pandemic, which has thrown everyone’s lives into turmoil, the natural expectation would be to see an increase in anxiety said lead author Emily Widnall, Senior Research Associate in Population Health Sciences at the University of Bristol’s Medical School.</p><p>"While we saw anxiety levels rise for a few of our participants, it was a big surprise to discover quite the opposite was the case for many of them. Of particular interest, those students who felt least connected to school before the lockdown saw a larger decrease in anxiety which raises questions about how the school environment affects some younger teenagers’ mental well-being.”</p><p>Depression levels remained fairly consistent over time, with a 2 per cent decrease of boys at risk of depression and a 3 per cent increase in girls at risk of depression.</p><p>“This was again unexpected and arguably shows the resilience of young people and their ability to adapt to challenging situations,” Widnall said.</p><p>“Amidst other headlines highlighting concerns about young people’s mental health being negatively affected, this is in one sense very welcome news, but at the same time it raises interesting questions about what the key drivers and triggers of anxiety or depression are for this particular age group.”</p><p>Many students’ sense of well-being also improved during lockdown, with boys showing a bigger improvement than girls. Those with the lowest levels of well-being pre-pandemic benefited most, with their scores increasing by 14 per cent compared to no increase in those with average to above average well-being.</p><p>“The survey gives a unique insight into how many younger teenagers feel without the day-to-day pressures of school life, for example academic achievement and challenging peer relationships, in their lives,” Widnall said.</p><p>Despite not attending, boys and girls both reported stronger connectedness to school during lockdown, with marked increases in the number of students who said they get the opportunity to talk with their teachers.</p><p>“This was another surprise finding. You would imagine being away from school would logically make you feel more distant and less connected. It will be interesting for further research to explore the reasons why young people reported feeling more connected to school, but one possible explanation could be the new ways that teachers found to engage with students via digital platforms, which of course young people are already very familiar with,” Widnall said.</p><p>Survey results showed reduced anxiety and improved well-being coincided with significantly greater usage of social media among girls. The biggest increase was seen during the week, when more than half of girls (55 per cent) reported spending in excess of three hours daily on social media during lockdown.</p><p>“This challenges the common perception that social media has a detrimental impact on young people’s mental health. The statistics for girls within this survey suggest these channels may play an important role in helping teenagers bond, feel more connected and in touch, especially during a period of physical isolation,” Widnall said.</p><p>“Respondents, especially girls, also reported using social media as a tool for learning, rather than just browsing or chatting amongst friends.”</p><p>The survey involved more than 1,000 year nine students from 17 secondary schools across the South West. Based on its findings, the report makes policy recommendations including prioritisation of student’s mental health and wellbeing alongside catch up on academic work and considering ways to prevent a rise in anxiety back to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Dr Judi Kidger, senior author and Lecturer in Public Health at the University of Bristol, said: “Our findings raise questions about the role of the school environment in explaining rises in mental health difficulties among teenagers in recent years. As schools re-open, we need to consider ways in which schools can be more supportive of mental health for all students.</p><p>"With children and young people having been out of the classroom for so long, and with many students in this study seeing improvements in mental health and well-being during that time, the case to address issues weighing on their quality of life at school is stronger than ever.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-08%2Fuob-rry082120.php&amp;t=YTVmY2Q3NWI5MjhlMWZkMDViNDhkZTZhZjljMGI2ZGJhZGZjODQ0NCwyb1RJU01saQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627296328752447488%2Fteenage-anxiety-covid-19-lockdown&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598473357">University of Bristol</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/620827694184185856/lock-down-sleep-quality">Sleep during COVID-19 lockdown: Longer and more regular, yet worse</a></p><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615500611887235072/social-distancing-2022">New study: Social distancing could be needed until 2022</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A refinement of O'Neill's colonies.</p><div>

<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
<p><a href="https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArtHiRes/70sArt/art.html"><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/Spacecolony1.jpg" alt="[A pair of O'Neill cylinders. https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArtHiRes/70sArt/art.html Interior view looking out through large windows. Art work: Rick Guidice.  NASA ID Number AC75-1086]" width="1920" height="1512"></a></p>
<p>Start with the idea of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O'Neill cylinder</a>: a spinning cylindrical space habitat 8 km in diameter and 32 km long.  The frequency of revolution is about two minutes.  This is a good diameter for a space habitat: if it is an order of magnitude larger, the structure won't hold together when it spins; an order of magnitude smaller, the Coriolis force is more noticeable.</p>
<p>The giant windows are a huge hazard for both radiation and meteor impacts.  Instead, make the cylinder a solid steel vessel, thick enough to block most radiation.  Make it out of many layers of steel sheeting, with a thick layer of ablative insulation on the outside that can absorb and redirect the kinetic energy of a meteor impact.  Construct it as several independent 8 km long segments, each with its own shielded endcaps, all sharing a common axis.  Each hab segment has airlocks at the axis, leading to rotating joints that connect the segment to two small non-rotating modules at the axis, where there are ports for visiting spacecraft to dock.  This is also where arrays of directional communication antennas are located.</p>
<p>At one end of the axis, there is a massive array of solar panels (not rotating with the hab), at the other, there is an array of radiators.  If the hab is too far from a star for solar power, a nuclear power plant is located outside of the hab, along the axis, in its own shielded module, as far away as needed to minimize radiation hazards to humans entering and exiting the habitat at the docking port module.</p>
<p>The ecology and economy of the hab is 99.9% closed - with energy as an input and heat as an output.  Occasionally, robots are sent out to mine asteroids or comets for material to replace material losses.  I expect that the solar power and radiator arrays will need constant maintenance and replacement to keep working at 100% capacity.  All of the habs in a star system exchange information, allowing the occupants of the habs to share and trade art, science, and culture.</p>
<p>The inside of the hab segment is either completely open or is segmented into many smaller "cells" big enough to feel open but small enough to give the human population more room.  A cell might have a ceiling 100 meters tall that looks like Earth's sky and provides similar light.  Some of the interior volume is taken up by light industry and vertical-farm-based agriculture.</p>
<p>This design is meant to be very robust and adaptable.  It doesn't matter if the hab is located in orbit around a red dwarf or a blue giant, as long as the solar panels work.  The hab can be sent on a thousand-year interstellar voyage as long as enough spare energy and material is taken along.  The occupants of the hab can remotely supervise robots to build new habs.</p>
<p>This is the future for humanity if we don't become post-human.  There aren't any planets out there that we can walk around in shirtsleeves on.  Terraforming projects would take many thousands of years at best, and might fall afoul of the law of unintended consequences.  Even Mars, one of the best possible places for humans to live outside of Earth, might not have enough gravity for standard humans to thrive.</p>
<p>I'm not saying rocky planets and moons aren't useful.  After all, that's where a lot of the useable material is.  But if you need that material, why not supervise robot miners from orbit?  Especially if the planet has a surface gravity of 1.5g or a surface temperature of 700 K.</p>

  <h2>2020-02-26</h2>

<p>I used to spend all of my free time programming random toy projects. Over time, likely after spending a few years in industry, I started to spend so much time thinking about how to write maintainable code that I think I started to lose out on what makes programming fun: exploring new ideas and learning how to do things I’ve never done before. I’d like to rediscover that joy, and to do that, I need to stop being so much of a perfectionist.</p>
<p>I think that in an office setting, deadlines force me to move on and call things done, but in my personal life, lack of that kind of pressure means that I can spend literally forever architecting and rearchitecting the same piece of code until it’s perfect (it never is).</p>
<p>To fix this, I’m going to try blogging! If I can make myself excited to share my code with other people, imperfect and unfinished as it is, then maybe I can start to unlearn the paralysis that’s been plaguing me for the past few years.</p>
<p>To start, I just want to walk through a small program I wrote a few months ago. I wanted to learn how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol">SSDP</a> works, so I implemented an SSDP Directory! For those of you who aren’t aware, SSDP is a fairly simple protocol from the 90s that’s used to facilitate the discovery of network services. Nowadays, it’s also used by everything from smart TVs to Hue lights.</p>
<p>My implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory">here</a>, and the (very readable!) RFC is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cai-ssdp-v1-03">here</a>.</p>
<p>If I run the application, it discovers all of the devices on my network:</p>
<pre><code>iex(1)&gt; SSDPDirectory.list_services
%{
  "uuid:b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970::upnp:rootdevice" =&gt; %SSDPDirectory.Service{
    location: "http://192.168.0.150:60000/upnp/dev/b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970/desc",
    type: "upnp:rootdevice",
    usn: "uuid:b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970::upnp:rootdevice"
  },
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The key to SSDP is what’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">multicast addressing</a>. Essentially, services broadcast their presence to a specially designated multicast address, and then anyone else on the network is able to listen for those presence notifications in order to track the appearance and disappearance of new services.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Elixir, my language of choice, makes subscribing to these notifications <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/multicast_channel.ex">easy</a>!</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.MulticastChannel do
  use GenServer

  alias __MODULE__

  alias SSDPDirectory.{
    Discovery,
    Presence
  }

  @multicast_group {239, 255, 255, 250}
  @multicast_port 1900

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end

  @spec broadcast(GenServer.name(), iodata) :: :ok
  def broadcast(channel \\ MulticastChannel, packet) do
    GenServer.cast(channel, {:broadcast, packet})
  end

  def init(:ok) do
    udp_options = [
      :binary,
      active: true,
      add_membership: {@multicast_group, {0, 0, 0, 0}},
      multicast_if: {0, 0, 0, 0},
      multicast_loop: false,
      reuseaddr: true
    ]

    {:ok, socket} = :gen_udp.open(@multicast_port, udp_options)

    {:ok, %{socket: socket}}
  end

  def handle_cast({:broadcast, packet}, state) do
    :ok = :gen_udp.send(state.socket, @multicast_group, @multicast_port, packet)

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:udp, _socket, _ip, _port, data}, state) do
    Task.Supervisor.start_child(SSDPDirectory.DecodingSupervisor, fn -&gt;
      with {:ok, packet, rest} &lt;- :erlang.decode_packet(:http_bin, data, []),
           {:ok, handler} &lt;- packet_handler(packet),
           {:ok, decoded} &lt;- handler.decode(rest) do
        :ok = handler.handle(decoded)
      end
    end)

  defp packet_handler({:http_request, "NOTIFY", _target, _version}),
    do: {:ok, Presence}

  defp packet_handler({:http_response, _version, 200, "OK"}),
    do: {:ok, Discovery.Response}

  defp packet_handler(_packet), do: :error
end</code></pre>
<p>Most of the magic happens in the <code>init/1</code> function. By opening a UDP socket and joining it to the protocol’s multicast group, our process is now able to receive packets that are broadcast to that group. That receiving logic is located in the <code>handle_info/2</code> function within the same file.</p>
<p>When receiving a packet, we spawn another process that is responsible for handling that packet. This process runs under a <code>Task.Supervisor</code> in order to isolate crashes of that process from the <code>MulticastChannel</code>. Also interesting, is that we’re able to decode the incoming packets using <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#decode_packet-3">:erlang.decode_packet/3</a>. This is a builtin function that allows us to decode a variety of packet formats, piece-by-piece. In this case, we’re using it to parse the packet as an HTTP packet. This is the same way that Elixir’s <a href="https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint/blob/master/lib/mint/http1/response.ex#L7">Mint</a> decodes HTTP responses too!</p>
<p>Based on the type of packet decoded, <code>packet_handler/1</code> then delegates the handling of that packet to another module. Either we’ve received an HTTP NOTIFY request, and we’re dealing with a <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/presence.ex">presence notification</a>, or we’ve received a <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/discovery/response.ex">response to a discovery request</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the presence case. In case you’re curious, here’s an example presence notification:</p>
<pre><code>NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1
Host: 239.255.255.250:reservedSSDPport
NT: blenderassociation:blender
NTS: ssdp:alive
USN: someunique:idscheme3
AL: &lt;blender:ixl&gt;&lt;http://foo/bar&gt;
Cache-Control: max-age = 7393</code></pre>
<p>And here’s where we handle it:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Presence do
  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__
  alias SSDPDirectory.HTTP

  @type command :: Presence.Alive.t() | Presence.ByeBye.t()

  @spec decode(binary) ::
          :error
          | {:ok, command}
  def decode(data) do
    case HTTP.decode_headers(data, []) do
      {:ok, headers, _rest} -&gt;
        process_headers(headers)

      :error -&gt;
        _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Failed to decode NOTIFY request: " &lt;&gt; inspect(data) end)

        :error
    end
  end

  @spec handle(command) :: :ok
  def handle(%Presence.Alive{} = command) do
    Presence.Alive.handle(command)
  end

  def handle(%Presence.ByeBye{} = command) do
    Presence.ByeBye.handle(command)
  end

  defp process_headers(headers) do
    do_process_headers(headers, %{})
  end

  defp do_process_headers([], args) do
    case args do
      %{command: "ssdp:alive", usn: usn, type: type}
      when not is_nil(usn) and not is_nil(type) -&gt;
        {:ok,
         %Presence.Alive{
           usn: usn,
           type: type,
           location: Map.get(args, :location)
         }}

      %{command: "ssdp:byebye", usn: usn, type: type}
      when not is_nil(usn) and not is_nil(type) -&gt;
        {:ok,
         %Presence.ByeBye{
           usn: usn,
           type: type
         }}

      _ -&gt;
        :error
    end
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"nts", command} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :command, command)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"nt", type} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :type, type)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"usn", usn} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :usn, usn)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"al", location} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :location, location)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"location", location} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :location, location)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([_ | rest], args) do
    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>It looks like there’s a lot going on here, but it’s actually pretty simple. Starting in <code>decode/1</code>, we continue decoding the packet from <code>MulticastChannel</code>. This time it’s the headers we’re interested in, so we decode those, and then process them in order to determine what kind of command we’re dealing with.</p>
<p>The processing step simply involves recursing over the list of headers, and accumulating the relevant ones in a map . Once we’ve done that, we just construct the corresponding command!</p>
<p>Lastly, the command handler delegates to a third module based on the type of command being processed. For example, in the case of an <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/presence/alive.ex">ssdp:alive</a> command:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Presence.Alive do
  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__

  alias SSDPDirectory.{
    Cache,
    Service
  }

  @enforce_keys [:usn, :type]
  defstruct [:location] ++ @enforce_keys

  @type t :: %Alive{}

  @spec handle(Alive.t()) :: :ok
  def handle(%Alive{} = command) do
    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Handling ssdp:alive request: " &lt;&gt; inspect(command) end)

    service = %Service{
      usn: command.usn,
      type: command.type,
      location: command.location
    }

    :ok = Cache.insert(service)
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>Here we just construct a service using the parameters in the command, and then store it in our <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/cache.ex">cache</a>:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Cache do
  use GenServer

  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__
  alias SSDPDirectory.Service

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(Cache, :ok, opts)
  end

  def contents(cache \\ Cache) do
    :ets.tab2list(cache)
    |&gt; Enum.into(%{})
  end

  def insert(cache \\ Cache, %Service{} = service) do
    GenServer.call(cache, {:insert, service})
  end

  def delete(cache \\ Cache, %Service{} = service) do
    GenServer.call(cache, {:delete, service})
  end

  def flush(cache \\ Cache) do
    GenServer.call(cache, :flush)
  end

  def init(:ok) do
    table = :ets.new(Cache, [:named_table, read_concurrency: true])

    {:ok, %{table: table}}
  end

  def handle_call({:insert, %Service{usn: usn} = service}, _from, data) when not is_nil(usn) do
    :ets.insert(data.table, {usn, service})

    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Cached service: " &lt;&gt; inspect(usn) end)

    {:reply, :ok, data}
  end

  def handle_call({:delete, %Service{usn: usn}}, _from, data) when not is_nil(usn) do
    :ets.delete(data.table, usn)

    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Evicted service: " &lt;&gt; inspect(usn) end)

    {:reply, :ok, data}
  end

  def handle_call(:flush, _from, data) do
    :ets.delete_all_objects(data.table)

    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; …</code></pre></section></div>

                <p>by Richard Murphey</p>
                <p>
                <img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/tom_perkins_on_bob_swanson.png"></p><p>There is no shortage of online content about how to start a tech company, but there is comparatively little on how to start a biotech startup.  I recently came across an amazing set of interviews with the founders of Genentech that is the one of the best resources I've seen on biotech entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>In this post, I'll highlight 16 key quotes from early Genentech leaders and comment on how they can be applied to biotech startups today.</p>
                <p>The interviews that these quotes came from were originally conducted as source material for Sally Smith Hughes' book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00629MDKI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech</a>.  This book is a must-read for anyone looking to learn about the industry (it's a quick and engaging read as well -- I finished it in a day).  The interview transcripts are worth reading in their entirety (especially the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt9c6006s1&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4">Bob Swanson</a> and <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt467nb7wh&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4">Dave Goeddel</a> interviews) and are available for free online through <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/biosci/oh_list.html">Berkeley's Bancroft Library Oral History Center</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Early Genentech at a glance</h3>
                
                <p>To set the stage, here is a chart with major value inflection points during the early days of the company.  At this time, Bob Swanson, the founding CEO, was in his late 20s / early 30s, and most of Genentech's scientists, led by Dave Goeddel, were also in their 20s and 30s.  Bob's co-founder, UCSF professor Herb Boyer, was more experienced, but he took a fairly hands-off approach to the science.  Prior to starting Genentech, Bob had been laid off by venture fund Kleiner Perkins.</p>
                <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/genentech_vc_valuation.png"></p><p>Genentech was created to use emerging genetic engineering technology to create new medicines.  When the company was founded, genetic engineering was a new and relatively unknown field.  The leading scientists in the area thought it would be years or decades before genetic engineering was advanced enough to create medicines.  Big pharma companies were universally dismissive of the technology.</p>
                <p>The venture capital and startup industry was also in its infancy.  There was no such thing as a biotech startup, and there hadn't been a new pharma company created in decades.  Kleiner Perkins, one of the first venture capital funds, had just started (Bob was an early employee of the fund).  Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, less than a week before Genentech was founded.</p>
                <p>(As a side note, Apple and Genentech have always been somewhat linked.  Steve Jobs and Bob Swanson were the original young tech entrepreneurs.  When Genentech went public in 1980, it was the biggest tech IPO ever -- until Apple went public months later.  Art Levinson, who took over as Apple's chairman after Steve Jobs passed away and was on Google's board from 2004-2009, was an early employee at Genentech and was Genentech's CEO in the 1990s and 2000s).</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Overview of early Genentech's strategy</h4>
                
                <p>Genentech's strategy was to first prove that the technology could work -- that bacteria or yeast could be engineered to make human proteins -- and then to use genetic engineering to make products.  They proved the concept by getting bacteria to produce somatostatin, a small hormone.  Somatostatin wasn't useful as a medicine, but it was a relatively simple molecule to make with their tech and thus a good proof-of-concept.</p>
                <p>Genentech's first major product was recombinant insulin.  At the time, insulin was obtained by killing pigs or cows and extracting it from their tissues.  This was an expensive and potentially less safe approach than producing human insulin from bacteria or yeast.  Cloning insulin put Genentech on the scientific and financial map and kickstarted the biotech industry.</p>
                <p>With that context in hand, here's how Genentech approached building a biotech startup:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Create value by eliminating risk</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>Bill Hambrecht…has said the only common characteristic he has noticed in the successful entrepreneurs he's invested in has been that they're all basically conservative…they're willing to go for it, but everyone is looking at how you minimize the risks as you're doing so.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>In most industries, companies create value by growing revenue or profits.  In biotherapeutics, companies cannot sell products until FDA approves them, which can take years.  But pre-revenue drugs can still be immensely valuable.  In development-stage drug companies, value is created by eliminating technical risk.</p>
                <p>Like many other entrepreneurs, Bob had a unique attitude toward risk: part risk-averse, part risk-seeking.  In the <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/josh">words of Josh Wolfe</a>, co-founder of Lux Capital, "entrepreneurs aren't risk takers.  They're risk killers".</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Build a "staircase of value"</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>I tried to organize things so that once you had success and created value in the company, then you raised the next round of money for the next success that would create greater value…. So it's sort of building a staircase…to the point where your cash flow is positive from product sales.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Bob's goal from the beginning was to build a fully integrated pharma company -- one that developed and sold its own products.  He broke this goal into small units of value creation, and raised a new round of capital to fund each unit.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>"Make something people want"</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>This is the essence of a company. The better you understand customers' needs…the more value the product has that they're willing to buy. Then you make more money, and the more money you make, the more it says, "I'm doing things right. I'm a healthy company.”</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Bob understood that the success of the company depended on its ability to create value for customers.  In the words of Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html">"make something people want"</a>.</p>
                <p>This holds true in biotech today.  Understanding a patient's condition, the available treatment options, and unmet clinical needs is the starting point for developing a drug.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Science first</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>One of the reasons companies succeed or fail is which projects get cut and which ones don’t…. It's a judgement call, and that's where you need the very top scientists and medical doctors and everybody to make that call--when to stop it, when is enough, and when to go the next round.</p>
                    <p>- Bob Swanson</p>
                </div>
                <p>Genentech focused on recruiting the best scientists and creating a culture that prized science above all else.  Genentech needed the best scientists because it was working in a competitive, cutting edge field, but also knew that the company needed to be rigorous and scientific in its business decision making.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Scientists first</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p><i>Bob Swanson</i>: Boyer's idea was…"Let's give [the young scientists] the credit." He didn't put his name on the insulin paper. And that, for a postdoc, is pretty attractive, rather than having your boss trying for the credit all the time and to keep you as the worker….</p>
                    <p>So the advantages were freedom from seeking out grants, a chance to be owners of the company.</p>
                    <p><i>Sally Smith Hughes</i>: Could you in addition to the equity offer them higher salaries than they were making in academia?</p>
                    <p><i>Bob</i>: Oh, yes. Postdocs continue to be very poorly paid. So yes, we could offer them good salaries.</p>
                </div>
                <p>To recruit the best scientists, Genentech combined the best attributes of academia and industry.  Genentech gave scientists the opportunity to work on important scientific problems, a large degree of freedom, and encouraged them to publish their results.  At the same time, Genentech gave credit based on merit, not seniority, paid scientists much more than they would make in academia, and issued stock grants that could provide life-changing financial gains if the company succeeded.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Work on ambitious problems</h3>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p>We don't work on any projects we can't get someone excited about…I think the key to any organization is hiring outstanding people, and helping them get excited about what they're doing.</p>

                <p>Genentech's ambition was key to recruiting and motivating the best scientists.  As <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful">Sam Altman</a> says, "It’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters."</p>

                <h3>Products before platform</h3>

                <div>
                    <p>We were very focused on products, and that made a big difference. I know Cetus at the time was more into developing the technology. I said, "Well, let's make a product, and we'll develop the technology we need to make the product, and let the product drive the science, rather than the other way around." Actually, we wound up doing better science because of that, and also we got a product.</p>

                <p>Genentech was developing arguably the most powerful tech platform in the history of pharma, but it didn't focus on building a platform.  Genentech focused first on products, and built their platform to support product development efforts.  This ended up being a …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The web is in need of some reinvention right now.</p><p>The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.</p><p>The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.</p><p><em>I’m going to try and dissect and diagnose this situation, a bit. You can skip forward if you just want to read my casual, unprofessional pitch for a reboot of the web. The idea is that we could choose a new lightweight markdown format to replace HTML &amp; CSS, split the web into documents and applications, and find performance, accessibility, and fun again.</em></p><details><summary>This post uses the pedantic definition of "the web"</summary>I've discussed attempts to reinvent the "Internet" a few times. Things like dat, IPFS, and arweave are all projects to reinvent an Internet, or a transport and data-sharing layer. The web is what lies on top of that, the HTML, CSS, URLs, JavaScript, browsing experience.</details><h3 id="the-platform-collapse">The platform collapse</h3><p>The platform side is what changed last week, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">Mozilla laid off 250 employees</a> and indicated that it would affect Firefox development. Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine. One codebase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>, split into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> (Safari), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</p><p>This a textbook monoculture. In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers. But in a deeper way, it threatens one of the basic principles of how the web has evolved.</p><h3 id="specs--implementations">Specs &amp; implementations</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Decline" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.jpg"></picture></p><p>The web has evolved through a combination of <em>specifications</em> and <em>implementations</em>. Organizations like the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> have been collaboration spaces for independent developers, corporations, and academics to discuss potential new features of the web. Then, browsers would test those ideas out in a variety of implementations.</p><p>This was an interesting structural piece: it reassured us all that it was <em>possible</em> to follow along, and that a multi-participant web was one of our goals. It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually. Chrome was not always the first to jump on features, or the first to optimize.</p><p>It’s slower to collaborate than to work alone, but it was beneficial in some ways that we’ve lost now. Chrome has been moving extremely fast, adding new specifications and ideas at a startling rate, and it’s becoming one of the hardest pieces of software to replicate.</p><p>Mike Healy I think <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_hasarms/status/1296575224599556097">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Do you think the web has almost ‘priced itself out of the market’ in terms of complexity if only 1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?</p></blockquote><p>Not only is it nearly impossible to build a new browser from scratch, once you have one the ongoing cost of keeping up with standards requires a full team of experts. Read Drew DeVault’s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">Web browsers need to stop</a> for that point, and keep reading all of Drew’s stuff.</p><details><summary>What about Flow?</summary>Yep, there’s a <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/">browser called Flow</a>, which may exist and may support a full range of web standards. If it does exist, I’ll be very excited about it, but it has been teased for almost a year now without any concrete evidence, so it could equally be vaporware.</details><h3 id="the-problem-for-creators">The problem for creators</h3><p>The web has gotten much harder to develop for.</p><p>The web has had about 25 years to grow, few opportunities to shrink, and is now surrounded by an extremely short-sighted culture that is an outgrowth of economic and career short-termism. There are lots of <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">ways to do anything</a>, and some of the most popular ways of building applications on the web are - in my opinion - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">usually ghoulish overkill</a>.</p><p>The best way for folks to enter <em>web development</em> in 2020 is to choose a niche, like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and hope that there’s a CSS and accessibility expert on their team.</p><p>For folks who just want to create a web page, who don’t want to enter an industry, there’s a baffling array of techniques, but all the simplest, probably-best ones are stigmatized. It’s easier to stumble into building your resume in React with GraphQL than it is to type some HTML in Notepad.</p><h3 id="the-problem-for-consumers">The problem for consumers</h3><p>We hope that all this innovation is <em>for the user</em>, but often it isn’t. Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G). Webpage <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/webpages-are-getting-larger-every-year-and-heres-why-it-matters/">size growth</a> is outpacing it all.</p><p>The end result is that I no longer expect pages to be fast, even with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a> installed in Firefox and a good local <a href="https://sonic.net/">fiber internet provider</a>.</p><p>I don’t want to lay all of the blame at <em>those web developers</em>, though. Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no? (In that instance, I said no, and added a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a> that would block new advertiser access at the page level.)</p><h2 id="recreating-simplicity">Recreating simplicity</h2><blockquote><p>You cannot get a simple system by adding simplicity to a complex system. - <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-March/065087.html">Richard O’Keefe</a></p></blockquote><p>Where do we go from here? Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

                    <h4>Close encounters with high speed Robots</h4>
                </p><div>
                    <p>I don’t know how to do this, and that’s where it all started.
So I am a member of my school’s <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> team, <a href="https://www.raiderrobotics.org/">5024 Raider Robotics</a> and I decided to join because I love STEM related things and I decided that it would be a great idea to join the Robotics team.</p>

<p>At first I wasn’t planning on becoming a programmer. I was planning on being part of the build team, if I went through with being on the build team I wouldn’t be writting this.</p>

<p>So my father is also works with programming related things and he told me to at least give programming a shot, he told me it would be easier for me to do programming than doing build related related things. So I talked with one of the mentors on the team and he told me to give it a shot (and looking back at that time I think I made the right choice).</p>

<p>So I gave it a shot, and on the first few weeks I felt a little bit left out. I am the only girl in the programming subteam and sometimes I felt like I didn’t belong there just because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most of the time I was just watching the older members do the work</li>
  <li>Some people told me I should have picked something like build or media (which I wasn’t mostly interrested in)</li>
  <li>Sometimes when I piched in my ideas people wouldn’t take me seriously.</li>
</ol>

<p>But as the season went on I started learning more, and more about programming and about what FRC actually is. And I made some good friends too.</p>

<p>You are probably very curious of what I mean by “Close encounters with high speed Robots”, it’s a fun story. But first I’ll give you some background information:</p>

<p>This year’s “game” for FRC was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE">Infinite Recharge</a>.</p>

<p>Our Robot <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5024">Death Raider</a>, is a robot that has a few powerful subsystems, like our Intake, Hopper, Shooter, Climber, Drivetrain, and our beloved Vision Target.</p>

<p>On a Friday night me and another one of the programmers were testing our Vision Target, the point of having that vision target is that we can get the robot to line up on a position by it’s self to shoot the balls into the goal.</p>

<p>We were testing that in our build room. Our build room has very bright lights and instead of the target the vision target tracked one of the lights and came back full speed at me and my friend. He managed to get out of the way but I got lucky enough to get trapped between a desk and a pile of scrap metal (It wasn’t a fun night).</p>

            <p>I've had the pleasure to work with very experienced firmware developers; the
kind of people who know the size of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">red
zones</a> and routinely
transform coffee into linker scripts and pointer dereferences. In other words,
the <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html">Mels</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf">Zeus
Hammers</a> of the
world.</p>
<p>When it comes to the tools of our trade, many of them are curious and
experimental. Some of them—very much myself included—explore far enough to leave
pragmatism behind and veer into idealism, stubbornly forcing beautiful round
pegs into industrial square holes. Hey, maybe they're square for a reason, but
it doesn't hurt to try.</p>
<p>The majority of them aren't like that. Your average battle-tested firmware
developer has accrued a healthy distrust of the abstract, probably born of
watching shiny platonic constructs crash and burn with painfully <em>real</em> and
<em>concrete</em> error traces. It is sobering, having to chase a hardfault on a tiny
MCU across enough vtables and templated code to make Herb Sutter puke angle
brackets. No wonder modern approaches are met with some resistance unless the
LOADs and the STOREs are in clear view.</p>
<p>I felt this way too when someone suggested to me, back in 2014, that an
up-and-coming language called <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> showed promise
in the embedded field. <em>Surely not</em>, I thought, <em>too high level.</em> Even though I
had been playing with it already, my profoundly ingrained bit-twiddling
instincts told me not to trust a language that supported functional programming,
or one that dared to have an <em>opinion</em> on how I managed my memory. Bah! That's
how you get philosophers to run out of forks, and your forks to turn into
SIGSEGVs.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Through the past five years of experimentation, I've gone from intrigued, to
optimistic, to <em>convinced</em> that Rust is an ideal language to build industrial
grade, bulletproof bare metal software. Beyond that, I've come to realize that
even the highest level constructs that the base language offers are applicable
to firmware development, very much unlike other languages that span a wide range
of paradigms (I'm looking at you, C++). There are a few reasons I felt this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust's safety guarantees and general strictness bring the debug time down
significantly, so there's less need to spend time developing mental maps of
how high level constructs correspond to hardware primitives.</li>
<li>The type system is <em>great</em> at enforcing local reasoning and preventing leaky
abstractions. Building decoupled systems with no runtime cost is easy.</li>
<li>The compiler error messages are worthy of an AI assistant with <em>concerning</em>
mind-reading abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, I've had the chance to work on a Rust
<a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f412.html">STM32F412</a>
project in a professional setting, with one of the goals being to foster a Rust
knowledge pool at my company. The project, <code>Loadstone</code>, is a 32kb secure
bootloader targeting bare metal devices for the medical industry.</p>
<p>While it would've been easier—and much less of a headache to my colleagues—to
stick to a subset of Rust more familiar to C developers, with your <code>for</code>s, your
<code>*mut u8</code>s and your <code>unsafe</code>s, I instead decided not to pull any punches and
make liberal use of generics, iterator adapters, typestate programming and other
stuff that would've made 2010's cuervo cry blood and hug the closest copy of
Kernighan and Ritchie.</p>
<p>The pressures of a real collaborative project have taught me a lot, and many
assumptions have been refined thanks to the criticism of several skilled
outsiders who, as outsiders often do, had a privileged view on things I took for
granted.</p>
<p>A topic that came up frequently in code review is
<a href="https://thume.ca/2019/07/14/a-tour-of-metaprogramming-models-for-generics/">generics</a>.
Perhaps still recovering from a SFINAE nightmare, some colleagues were
unsure about the use of generics to group behaviour that we'd normally write
separate implementations for. The concerns tended to fall in one of three
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runtime performance.</li>
<li>Binary size bloat.</li>
<li>Habitability and readability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is easy to dispel, as it often comes from unfamiliarity with static
dispatch. No vtables or heap allocations in anything we're doing, promise! The
second concern is valid but I've found it to be negligible in practice; I have
plans for another blog post giving some concrete benchmarks.</p>
<p>The last concern is the most subjective and thus the hardest to argue, so I
decided to focus on it in this blog series. I'll go over the design process of
two similar flash memory drivers, and hopefully show how generic programming can
make the job easier and the result more habitable, even in the barren, heapless,
rugged world of bare metal firmware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compile times are another common—and very valid—argument against liberal use
of generics. However, it is not a big problem for low footprint embedded
projects like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">Flash memory</a> is electronic
non-volatile storage. It's ubiquitous in consumer electronics; any time you
switch a small device off and it <em>remembers something</em>—whether it's settings,
songs, documents, even its own program—chances are you have flash memory to
thank. We'll be looking at two different <em>NOR</em> flash chips, since the first demo
port of <code>Loadstone</code> requires us to operate both:</p>
<ul>
<li>The embedded
<a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f412.html">STM32F412</a>
1MB MCU flash.</li>
<li>The external 128MB <a href="https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/data-sheet/nor-flash/serial-nor/n25q/n25q_128mb_1_8v_65nm.pdf">Micron
N25Q128</a>
flash chip present in the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f412gdiscovery.html">STM32F412ZGT6 Discovery
Kit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably knew what flash memory is used for already, but what non-firmware
developers may not know is that flash memory is <em>quirky</em>. You cannot simply
write a byte to a NOR flash address, sir, that would be rude. While a blob of
flash memory will happily turn a <code>1</code> into a <code>0</code>, the opposite operation will
fail silently.</p>
<p>You can think of every <code>1</code> bit (NOR flash's <em>erased</em> state) as a lit candle you
can blow out. However, in this metaphor you don't get a lighter
to light them back up; you get a flamethrower. Without getting into the hardware
principles involved, the design of NOR flash memory requires that you erase
(i.e. set to <code>1</code>) memory <em>in bulk</em>, in chunks often orders of magnitude bigger
than the minimum addressable memory. On most chips you even have a three way
mismatch: your read, write and erase sizes aren't equal. Ugh.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this makes writing flash drivers a bit of a pain,
particularly because even the smallest write operations turn into <em>read/write
cycles</em>. Writing a single byte requires reading the minimum erasable block
surrounding the targeted address (which may itself require multiple reads),
potentially erasing the entire block, then writing back the original data merged
with the desired byte.</p>
<p>As you can also imagine, nobody but the person writing this driver <em>wants to
care about this</em>. Even in the minimalistic world of bare metal software,
productive collaboration depends on developers filing away these sharp edges,
presenting interfaces that uniformize or hide any aspects of hardware irrelevant
to the bigger design. As such, a first stab at a flash memory interface should
simply offer a way to read and write ranges of memory.</p>
<p>Let's look at some code:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>ReadWrite {
   </span><span>type </span><span>Error;
   </span><span>type </span><span>Address;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; (</span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address);
   </span><span>fn </span><span>erase</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The above is what I converged on as a generic interface to a flash
driver. If you're unfamiliar with Rust generics, the above isn't a type, or a
parent class to inherit from. It's more like a Haskell typeclass; a set of
requirements for a concrete type to implement, described in this case in the
form of associated types (<code>Error</code> and <code>Address</code>) and method signatures (<code>read</code>,
<code>write</code>, <code>range</code> and <code>erase</code>).</p>
<p>Even at this early step, some tradeoffs have to be made. The keen,
hardfault-traumatized reader will notice that this interface doesn't lend itself
well to timing sensitive problems. All methods are blocking, and abstracting the
read/write cycle away will naturally lead to non-deterministic write times; a
write may take very little if it only requires toggling bits off, or it might
take very long if it straddles two big sectors requiring erase operations. The
<code>bytes</code> output parameter in <code>read</code> might also strike you as not too rusty, where
returning a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> is often idiomatic. Unfortunately we have no heap to work
with, so if you want to take your bytes home you'll have to bring your own bag.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's hard to write the universal interface. This one made sense for the
problems we're solving, but make sure to keep in mind the requirements of your
project!</p>
<h3 id="why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type">Why not simply write a concrete type?<a href="#why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Ah, the word "simply" is tricky. Datasheet in hand, it may have been easier to
write. It might even save us a few bytes down the line. But altogether I think
the benefits of starting here are well worth the drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easy to write test doubles and leverage static dispatch for unit
testing. This kind of approach is what I miss the most when writing C, where
I'm forced to resort to link time substitution or to do things with the
preprocessor too vile to even mention here.</li>
<li>Decouples your design from the get go and makes collaboration easy. Another
developer can immediately start working against this interface, and it's
abstract enough to give you confidence it won't need to be changed as more
knowledge of the hardware emerges.</li>
<li>Going abstract first forces you to think long and hard about what behaviour is
common to each implementation and what behaviour isn't, which helps to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">not
repeat yourself</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the biggest reason, and one where C++ and Rust diverge, is the fact that
<em>you can reason about this interface locally</em>. This stems from a non-obvious
difference between the C++ template system and Rust traits. Where C++ templates
type check at the point of instantiation, Rust traits type check at the point of
definition.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that the inscrutable, seven-feet-deep-in-a-library
C++ template errors are impossible in Rust, because the compiler doesn't need to
go beyond the interface to prove it is used correctly.</p>
<p>A similar interface using C++ …</p></div></div>

<p>Our societal narratives are invisible by dint of their ubiquity, but they are far more important in stabilizing the status quo that all the cops and jails and domestic surveillance agencies put together.</p>
<p>Take inequality: when a few have much, and the many have little, the primary means of preventing the many from seizing the wealth of the few isn't burglar alarms – it's legitimacy.</p>
<p>If you can convince people that wealth is both earned and deserved, you can save a lot on armed guards, vaults and CCTV cameras.</p>
<p>The aristocracy once used the church to effect this legitimacy: as the English crown's motto goes, "Dieu et mon droit" ("God and my right").</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>The aristocratic legitimacy story makes it a literal sin to question inequality.</p>
<p>As the aristocracy gave way to merchant princes, society needed a new stabilizing story: the tale of the market, whose invisible hand allocates capital to the most deserving.</p>
<p>It's a highly circular form of reasoning, of course: "I am deserving because I am rich; I am rich because I am deserving."</p>
<p>Naturally, this self-serving logic attracted ridicule.</p>
<p>Notably, the sociologist Michael Young wrote a satirical, dystopian novel mocking this idea called "The Rise of the Meritocracy."</p>
<p>His coinage, "Meritocracy," was meant to deflate the delusion that wealth was merit and merit was wealth.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy_(1967_cover).jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy_(1967_cover).jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Instead, the term was adopted by the very people it was meant to lampoon: soon, capitalism boosters and defenders of inequality began to proclaim themselves to be "meritocrats" and defended the institutions that had enriched them as "meritocratic." Yeah, it's weird.</p>
<p>At its core, "meritocracy" is eugenics: the belief that some people are just intrinsically better than others (that's why you often hear plutocrats boasting of their "good blood" – think of Trump here).</p>
<p>Sometimes it's dressed up with coded language like "self-control" or "grit," but ultimately, it's about some in-born spark that both demands that the meritocrat lead the rest of us, and that they be rewarded for it. You can tell you deserves to rule because they are ruling.</p>
<p>As with all eugenics stories, meritocracy is trivially disprovable pseudoscientific nonsense.</p>
<p>Stipulate for the sake of argument that there are "meritocratic" traits that some of us are born with.</p>
<p>One thing we know about hereditable traits is that they follow a normal distribution – a bell curve. If merit is a heritable trait, then it should follow that same distribution.</p>
<p>But recall that "merit" is the excuse given for inequality: the market is a system for uncovering and rewarding merit, matching quanta of merit with dollars in a precise ratio (Bill Gates's $114b and Jeff Bezos's $196b tells us that Gates possesses 58% of Bezos's merit).</p>
<p>And unfortunately for meritocracy's coherence, the actual wealth distribution follows a power-law curve, not a bell-curve. The zottarich are an order of magnitude richer than the gigarich, who are an order of magnitude richer than the ultrarich and so on.</p>
<p>Plutocracy is asymptotic to infinity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Long_tail.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Long_tail.svg.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>And while eugenics fails to account for this distribution there's another hypothesis that turns out to be a good fit: the rich are lucky.</p>
<p>Enter "Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure," a paper from a group of U Catatania researchers that proposes a model for explaining deepening inequality.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068</a></p>
<p>A breakdown in MIT Technology Review explains it well. The model assumes that N people have various talents "around some average level, with some standard deviation."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/?itm_source=parsely-api">https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/?itm_source=parsely-api</a></p>
<p>"The computer model charts each individual through a working life of 40 years. During this time, the individuals experience lucky events that they can exploit to increase their wealth if they are talented enough.</p>
<p>"However, they also experience unlucky events that reduce their wealth. These events occur at random."</p>
<p>After 40 simulated years, the agents in the simulation have a wealth distribution that looks a hell of a lot like ours.</p>
<p>They run the simulation repeatedly, and get the same distribution every time. In other words, markets allocate capital primarily by luck, not merit.</p>
<p>However, I'd like to see another version of this experiment that adds in immorality: a willingness to cheat and steal. Given the state of the plutocracy, I hypothesize an even stronger correlation.</p>

<p>There's a lot going for AOC: she's a once-in-a-generation gifted orator, she's got a sharp political mind, she's got the humility and self-awareness to surround herself with other smart people and recruit them to advise her.</p>
<p>But even her most ardent admirers tend to overlook the role of graphic design in her work. From the start – her initial primary campaign – she has led the field with striking, beautiful graphic design. I framed one of her posters and hung it my house.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/29687015957_49490e9a62_h.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/29687015957_49490e9a62_h.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>AOC's latest graphic campaign is in support of the Green New Deal, a visionary proposal for a better future that has been sorely lacking in visual materials.</p>
<p>(The major exception being Molly Crabapple's animation in "A Message From the Future," an Intercept video with AOC and Naomi Klein).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ</a></p>
<p>The new posters recall the WPA illustrations for the National Park Service, icons of design that retain remarkable currency nearly a century later.</p>

<p>There are six in all. The first is Gavin Snider's Flushing Meadows poster, celebrating the 1939 New York World's Fair, a high water mark for hope in a moment of crisis.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/flushing_3afa961b-ecde-4170-b232-1490bb2a3817_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/flushing_3afa961b-ecde-4170-b232-1490bb2a3817_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Next is Scott Starrett's Pelham Bay Park poster, celebrating the Bronx's most iconic WPA success story, a beloved beach and golf course.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/pehlam_d017eb83-206e-4f60-aa73-b243f2c90d86_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/pehlam_d017eb83-206e-4f60-aa73-b243f2c90d86_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>The third poster is Gavin Snider's tribute to LA's Griffith Observatory, the centerpiece of one of the country's exemplary, beloved and well-used city parks.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/griffith_9016ef73-d08f-4d61-a12c-78585269f737_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/griffith_9016ef73-d08f-4d61-a12c-78585269f737_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Fourth is Lazarus Nazario's poster celebrating the Plaza Del Totem in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a symbol of indigenous resilience erected as a rebuttal to the shameful celebration of the great historic monster Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/deltotum_7eac067b-7c5b-4c09-8913-80d62d66e4c1_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/deltotum_7eac067b-7c5b-4c09-8913-80d62d66e4c1_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Fifth is Gavin Snider's poster for Detroit's Hart Plaza, whose monument commemorates the Underground Railroad in one of America's great historically Black cities, a city that has been brutalized by white supremacy and austerity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hartplaza_60af5125-8694-43dc-880e-e0b002fdaafb_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hartplaza_60af5125-8694-43dc-880e-e0b002fdaafb_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Finally, there's Dayi Tofu's commemoration of Boston's Public Garden, part of the city's "Emerald Necklace" of urban parks.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/publicgarden_ea48a057-d355-41b2-8dc0-bb5208f7388f_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/publicgarden_ea48a057-d355-41b2-8dc0-bb5208f7388f_1800x1800.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>The posters are a reminder that we are not the fallen remnants of a lost civilization, no longer capable of visionary collective projects to secure our future. We have done this before and we can do it again.</p>
<p>We are not atomized individuals, incapable of effecting change beyond the scope of what one person can do – or what one billionaire can coerce. We are a society, and we can steer our course.</p>
<p>The posters are union made, 18" x 12", and cost $24 each. You can get all six in a $90 bundle.</p>

Brown PhD</sup></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This month, Dr. Ronald B. Brown had a daring paper published in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/public-health-lessons-learned-from-biases-in-coronavirus-mortality-overestimation/7ACD87D8FD2237285EB667BB28DCC6E9#" target="_blank">Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness</a>, conservatively entitled <em>Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation</em>. </p>



<p>“The subject of this article is disruptive, to say the least, although it is not as obvious from the title,” Dr. Brown told me in an email. “The manuscript cites the smoking-gun, documented&nbsp;evidence showing that the public’s overreaction to the coronavirus pandemic was based on the worst miscalculation in the history&nbsp;of humanity,&nbsp;in my opinion. My manuscript underwent an intensive&nbsp;peer-review process. You are the first media guy who has responded to my invitation.”</p>



<p>It’s sadly no surprise the media has not kept Dr. Brown’s phone ringing with interview requests. The abstract, in itself, contains a firecracker where he says: </p>



<p>“Results of this critical appraisal reveal information bias and selection bias in coronavirus mortality overestimation, most likely caused by misclassifying an influenza infection fatality rate (IFR) as a case fatality rate (CFR).”</p>



<p>Is that not what we’ve seen? The number of people they said would be buried in mass COVID-19 graves better reflects how many people simply ended up with a cough and fever.</p>



<p>Dr. Brown added that CDC and WHO documents show that the case fatality rate for influenza was similar to the coronavirus, implying that the lockdowns were pointless. His paper questions why the 2017-2018 influenza season in the United States did not “receive the same intensive media coverage as COVID-19.”</p>



<p>He points out that “the accuracy of coronavirus tests rushed into production during the pandemic were unknown.” And he explores how the  media began focusing on an increase in coronavirus cases while ignoring the decrease in  death rates.</p>



<p>Much of the article looks at how lockdowns and anti-social distancing probably had little or no effect on reducing COVID-19 deaths. He says that “the public’s belief that mitigation measures were responsible for reducing coronavirus mortality may be a post hoc fallacy if lower mortality was actually due to the overestimation of coronavirus deaths.”</p>



<p>Speaking on the damage done by the counter-measures, Brown writes: “The ethics of implementing fear-based public health campaigns needs to be reevaluated for the potential harm these strategies can cause.”</p>



<p>His report includes this mind-map on how we were all mind-warped:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="447" height="447" src="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 447w, https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x300.png 300w, https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px"></figure></div>



<p>You can read Brown’s full paper at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7ACD87D8FD2237285EB667BB28DCC6E9/S1935789320002980a.pdf/public_health_lessons_learned_from_biases_in_coronavirus_mortality_overestimation.pdf" target="_blank">Cambridge University Press</a>. It succinctly dismisses the notion that the <a href="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/resist-the-corona-craze/" data-type="post" data-id="405">corona craze</a> has anything to do with welfare of the people. As Albert Camus warned: “The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience.”</p>

    <p>Using Generators to Modernize a Geriatric Javascript API for <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<hr>
<p>How do you find-and-replace text on an HTML page?</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><span>Hello, </span><span>&lt;span&gt;</span><span>human</span><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>If the text is neatly neatly isolated inside an HTML element, it's easy; this will do:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"span"</span><span>)</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>"evolved ape"</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>But here's a puzzle</strong>: how do you you change text that <em>isn't</em> neatly isolated in an HTML element?</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> use <code>innerHTML</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>elt </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML </span><span>= </span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>...but this will hose any event listeners registered on <code>elt</code>'s children.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> grapple onto the nearest selectable element:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>.childNodes[</span><span>0</span><span>];
</span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yuck; this sort of child-node indexing feels <em>really</em> brittle.</p>
<p><strong>Why can't we just <em>directly</em> select the text nodes containing <code>Hello</code>?</strong></p>
<h2 id="xpath">XPath</h2>
<p><strong>We can!</strong> Enter: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a>, the <em>excessively</em> powerful language for querying XML documents. It's usable in web-browsers with the, uh, <em>descriptively</em>-named method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate"><code>document.evaluate</code></a>.</p>
<p>It's a <em>bit</em> of a production to use:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>xpath </span><span>= </span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>; </span><span>// find text nodes containing 'Hello'
</span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.body; </span><span>// look in the body element
</span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>; </span><span>// some sorta xml voodoo
</span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE; </span><span>// DEFINITELY MAKE SURE YOU USE THIS

</span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>) {
  </span><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, you really need to write <em>all</em> of that. The <code>result_type</code> argument is technically optional, but omit it at your own peril: without it, you must instead stream results via <code>iterateNext</code>, and this will crash with an exception if you dare <em>modify</em> the queried elements!</p>
<p>It's no wonder <code>document.evaluate</code> is seldom used. <strong>Can we improve on it?</strong></p>
<h2 id="iterizing-xpath-queries">Iterizing XPath Queries</h2>
<p>Yes, with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators"><strong>generators</strong></a>! We can exploit the implicit iterability of generators to modernize this unwieldy API:</p>
<pre><code><span>Document</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.xpath </span><span>= </span><span>Element</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.</span><span>xpath </span><span>=
  </span><span>function* </span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>this </span><span>instanceof </span><span>Document </span><span>? </span><span>document</span><span>.documentElement </span><span>: </span><span>this</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE;
    </span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)
      </span><span>yield </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  };
</span></code></pre>
<p>And because the result of this function is iterable, we can use it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spread syntax</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>)</span><span>].
  </span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>node </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>))</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>

    <div>
        

<p>I was nearing the last working days of the job that I recently quit, I thought whether I should leave Bangalore. It was a good idea to start reducing the amount of stuff I owned if I planned to leave. I wasn’t very sure though. It made sense to downsize anyway.</p>

<p>So, I started taking photos of things I wouldn’t need and put them up on OLX. I knew I had a lot of junk, but when I started digging stuff out of boxes lying around I realized it was more than I had thought. I had two football pumps for instance! Badminton and squash rackets I hadn’t used in more than a year. As I had been more focused on outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, I didn’t think twice about letting go of stuff I hadn’t used in a while.</p>

<h2 id="limits">Limits!</h2>

<p>Once a few products sold, I got more confident about selling more, but then came an unexpected revelation. OLX has limits on how many ads one can put up for each category, and one has to wait up to 60 days or pay up to post more ads.</p>

<p>This was a major roadblock because I wanted to get rid of all the unused stuff in one go. That’s because selling used stuff is distracting and time-consuming. It’s like an unpredictable day job. Buyers might message or call you unexpectedly, ask a bunch of questions and eventually never turn up to make the deal. You can’t really focus on other work if you’re selling more than a few items.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-find">A new find!</h2>

<p>So while I was exploring alternatives to Olx, I stumbled upon Facebook Marketplace! I haven’t been actively using Facebook for the last few years and didn’t plan to change that. But Facebook Marketplace is an amazing piece of software, especially for selling used products.</p>

<p>Facebook Marketplace is better because,</p>

<ol>
<li>There are no limits to how many products you can list.</li>
<li>The pool of potential buyers is bigger</li>
<li>Your communications with sellers are better organized, you can see all your conversations grouped by each item.</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, no product is perfect, Facebook Marketplace has a few downsides too.</p>

<ol>
<li>You might find people making unreasonable requests. People asked me to ship to another city and expected cash on delivery, for an item I was selling for ₹200. The cheapest courier service would cost at least the same amount. This never happened on OLX.</li>
<li>I feel that there are more non-serious buyers on FB because people go to OLX with a clear intent of buying.</li>
<li>Facebook can be very distracting. I don’t particularly enjoy using Facebook, and because it’s all in one place and it’s easy to get distracted on Facebook</li>
<li>People might ridicule you for selling low-value items. I either ignore such people or tell them, “everything sells.” 😊</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a lot of items to sell, say more than 10, try to list on both Facebook Marketplace as well as OLX. Prefer OLX if you are selling fewer and high-value items.</p>

<p>Great, I had a new place to sell which doesn’t have a limit on listing count. But what I thought would be a few days of work, became a shitty day job. So I tried selling faster.</p>

<h2 id="selling-faster">Selling Faster</h2>

<p>I figured out that people bought a product very quickly if you offered them door delivery. Humans are lazy. Some deliveries were made by me on my bicycle or on a two-wheeler on my way to a friend’s place and some via apps like Dunzo or Porter. All except one delivery went smoothly.</p>

<p>Another strategy that works well is pitting buyers against each other by just letting them know that you have another buyer making an offer. This is especially useful when some buyers become inactive after making an offer.</p>

<p>I am not proud to be mentioning this, but I lied to some inactive buyers by asking them if they were still interested and I was checking with them before I made a deal with another buyer because they were the first ones to reach out. I did this to sell a product that had seen some activity but no buyer actually took the final step.</p>

<p>Things sell faster if you have all the accessories, the original packaging, and the invoice. So don’t throw away the packaging and invoice when you buy a used or a new item. It also helps if your item belongs to a well-known brand. It’s also a good idea to add product details, search the product on Amazon and Google to find out the details of the product. For instance, I sold a Dell laptop adapter and it helped to figure out which laptops that charger was compatible with.</p>

<h2 id="negotiation">Negotiation</h2>

<p>While taking good photos, writing a concise description, and setting an expected price are almost necessary to make a sale, negotiation is what you will spend most of your time on. So I think it’s important to negotiate fast and well.</p>

<p>Here are some tactics I employed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don’t reveal your “last” price, unless you’re in a hurry and you think the buyer is not a haggler. You’ve already mentioned a price in the listing, so if a buyer asks you for a price just repeat that. If they still insist, ask them to make an offer. Once they choose a number they can’t go below that price.</li>
<li>In some cases, if a buyer is in a hurry they will easily agree to your price. Give them a number and don’t respond for some time if they keep low-balling. Some buyers might automatically increase their offers. In one case a buyer agreed to my price within a few minutes of silence from my side.</li>
<li>Some buyers will point out flaws or missing accessories for your item. It’s pretty easy to say that you would have listed at a higher price if your item didn’t have those flaws.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="everything-sells">Everything sells</h2>

<p>Well almost. As I sold more and more stuff I thought of trying to sell stuff that I didn’t even think could even sell. More for the experimentation than the money. USB charging adapters, for instance. I think they are all the same except in terms of wattage. But not everyone thinks like me. An original 5W Apple iPod USB adapter is probably more valuable on the market than a 20W fast charger one from almost any other brand. I sold one for ₹500! One the other hand got laughed at for even thinking of listing a Xiaomi USB adapter.</p>

<h2 id="scams-and-surprises">Scams and Surprises</h2>

<p>Selling online comes with its own risks, especially in India. The most common scam I encountered was people accepting your listed price and agreeing to pay advance. What they do is send you a QR code which is actually a payment request and make it seem like a request which will credit money to your account. And usually, these people respond very quickly and almost never negotiate.</p>

<p>Amidst all of this, I was surprised when a buyer actually paid money in advance. I was so surprised and skeptical that I asked him how he trusted me and sent the money before actually getting the items. I could have refused to send him the products and blocked his number. Of course, I didn’t. And the sale happened smoothly except for a botch-up by the delivery truck driver who extracted money from both of us. I later got the issue resolved by the delivery service provider, namely Porter.</p>

<p>I also managed to sell an item to a buyer in another city. I asked a friend who has an online store if I could use her delivery partner to ship the item. She graciously agreed and it was only ₹155 to ship a 1kg package from Bangalore to Kochi. And the package was picked up from my doorstep. I later found out that one doesn’t need to have a business account to use Delhivery Direct’s service. Neat, eh?</p>

<h2 id="taking-a-step-back">Taking a step back</h2>

<p>In conclusion, selling your old junk on OLX and Facebook Marketplace is a great way to declutter and generate some extra cash. But it can take over your life and become akin to a day job. I have sold 24 items so far and still have 15 unsold items listed, but I have disabled notifications for both OLX and Facebook Marketplace and I check notifications only once a day or so to keep my sanity.</p>

<p>If you are curious about what I sold and for how much, I am attaching a table here for your reference. By the way, I lied! ₹14,000 out of the total ₹30,000 I got by selling old junk went to my friends whose items I sold on their behalf.</p>

    <h3>Finding vulnerable Twitter accounts with expired domains</h3>
    <p>August 23, 2020</p>
    <p>Recently, I discovered a simple yet suprisingly effective attack vector against Twitter accounts (and which likely applies to other platforms as well). This attack vector makes it easy to find and hack vulnerable accounts with login emails that are using expired domains. If a user creates a Twitter account with an email on their own domain, then forgets to renew their domain at some point, that account can be hijacked by registering the domain, forwarding all emails to your email, then submitting a password reset on that account. By itself, this is hardly an attack vector since finding such vulnerable accounts is the more important part, and we already know that owning someone's email is essentially a "game over" situation. This attack becomes more dangerous when you can combine it with an efficient method to find these vulnerable accounts quickly and at scale. As it turns out, this is trivial on Twitter for several reasons attributable to their platform design.</p>
    <p>If you're familiar with Twitter, you know that users are given the option to add a public website url. With a simple script and proxy, an attacker can quickly iterate over millions of accounts and check if the domain in that url is not registered; this usually indicates some likelihood that the Twitter account was created with an email address on a now-expired domain. To verify this, they can submit a password reset which will show them a censored version of the account email address for confirmation; however, even though it's censored, it still provides enough information to check if the email domain matches the expired domain listed on their account profile. If it does, the attacker now knows this is an account that can be hacked. Once this entire process is automated, it makes finding these accounts very easy. This method of account hijacking is very likely being used right now by malicious hackers, and I believe it accounts for a large portion of stolen accounts/handles on the platform.</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/twitter-emails.png">
    <p>This attack can potentially be executed on other platforms besides Twitter, assuming one can find a similar discovery method. In Twitter's case, they could make it harder to discover these accounts by not showing any email confirmation upon requesting a password reset. This would make the process more costly for attackers who would no longer be able to verify whether an account can be hacked prior to registering the domain. Or perhaps, Twitter should monitor and unlist domains that are no longer registered and notify users when this happens so that they're aware. As for most users, in addition to turning on 2FA, it's important to be very cautious when using an email on your own domain to create accounts; it makes it much easier to lose access if you forget to renew or can't under certain extreme circumstances like incarceration or death.</p>

          <div><blockquote><span>A refined knowledge of several languages provides a reservoir of meanings and enhances a person's ability to apprehend and express the plurality of the world. 
— </span> <em>David le Breton</em> <span> ﻿</span></blockquote></div>  <p><span>Over the years, I have learned 9 languages. For different reasons. And at various levels of proficiency.</span></p> <p><span>With the increasingly effectiveness of machine translation that gets us answers in real-time, learning a language becomes less about the functional necessity.  </span></p> <p><span>This article explores the ways in which learning languages is valuable, beyond its immediate utility. </span></p>  <p><h2><span>Sensing More Dimensions of Reality</span></h2></p> <p><span>The quote by David le Breton at the beginning of this post puts it more eloquently than I can. </span></p> <p><span>There are so many possible dimensions of reality. Each language is a system of filters that captures the multitude of sensations and meanings in its own way. </span></p> <p><span>Having more of these filters in your tool-kit is advantageous for parsing the world. It helps you better explain and enjoy it. </span></p>  <p><h2><span>Surface Area of Appreciation</span></h2></p> <p><span>Translation attemps to map the experience in one culture to an analogous experience in a different culture.</span></p> <p><span>But emotions and feelings are hard to capture. And some sensations are just uniquely expressed in a specific language. Definitions in a dictionary are not helpful in this case.</span></p> <p><span>You may be able to appreciate the melodic phrases and the percussion of words when listening to poetry / rap music in a foreign language. But you miss out on the cleverness, technical wizardry, and layers of references.</span></p> <p><span>Watching the works of the comedic master </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Chow" target="_blank"><span>Stephen Chow</span></a> <span> without knowing Cantonese is as good as pinching your nose when eating a delicious meal.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Deeper Connections with People</span></h2></p> <p><span>As you learn a language, you naturally develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for others' cultures.</span></p> <p><span>Ever experienced the moments of delight with a person from another culture when you show understanding of an obscure cultural reference? The surprised look on their face and the engaging conversation that ensues are just priceless. </span></p> <p><span>It immediately draws you closer to each other. It is a genuine way of saying </span> <em>"I hear you."</em> <span> ﻿</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Found in Translation</span></h2></p> <p><span>Learning a language helps you not just understand the target language / culture itself, but more broadly about the human condition. </span></p>  <p><span>Another example would be the </span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_Motion" target="_blank"><span>Structure from Motion</span></a> <span> technique in computer vision, where moving the position of a 2D camera helps us estimate 3D structures in the images captured.</span></p> <p><span>Learning languages is a reliable way to acquire these lenses, and a more flexible mind.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Travelling Becomes More Fun</span></h2></p> <p><span>This is perhaps obvious. But even though Google Translate has become very convenient, it is nice not having to look at my phone the whole time when I travel.</span></p> <p><span>Knowing the local language is helpful for navigating and avoiding tourist traps. But more importantly, it expands what you are capable of noticing. It unlocks layers of experience that are otherwise hidden from you.</span></p> <p><span>It shifts your attention from the the surface-level appreciation of sights and occasional signs you understand, to understanding the messaging of various displays and eavesdropping on the locals in addition to people-watching.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, and you often get special treatment speaking the local language :)  </span></p>  <p><h2><span>Learning Languages Itself Becomes Easier</span></h2></p> <p><span>The more languages you already know, the easier it is for you to pick up a new one. It is perhaps the biggest factor in estimating </span> <a href="https://knowledgeartist.org/articles/1021e2dc-845a-494f-b598-def49c37234e/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-a-language" target="_blank"><span>how long it takes to learn a language</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>This advantage can be direct: in learning a new language with cognates (words with a shared origin) and similar language structures. For instance, roughly 60% of Korean words have a Chinese origin. Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese are almost mutually intelligible. And the indirect effects include having a more flexible mind and getting better at adapting to new patterns of thoughts.  </span></p>  <p><span>Knowing multiple languages is advantageous. The learning process is in most cases a fun and expansive journey.

      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll write a Python to C compiler in Python. This is
especially easy to do since Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">builtin parser
library</a> and because a
number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/">CPython internals are exposed for extension
writers</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, in a few hundred lines of Python, we'll be able to
compile and run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/recursive_fib.py
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


def main():
    print(fib(40))
$ python3 pyc tests/recursive_fib.py
$ ./bin/a.out
102334155
</code></pre>
<p>This post implements an extremely small subset of Python and
<strong>completely gives up on even trying to manage memory</strong> because I
cannot fathom manual reference counting. Maybe some day I'll find a
way to swap in an easy GC like Boehm.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/pyc">Source code for this project is available on Github.</a></p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3><p>We'll need Python3, GCC, libpython3, and clang-format.</p>
<p>On Fedora-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install gcc python3-devel clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>And on Debian-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>
  This program will likely work as well on Windows, Mac, FreeBSD,
  etc. but I haven't gone through the trouble of testing this (or
  providing custom compiler directives). Pull requests welcome!
</p><h3 id="a-hand-written-first-pass">A hand-written first-pass</h3><p>Before we get into the compiler, let's write the fibonacci program by
hand in C using libpython.</p>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding">Python embedding
guide</a>
we'll need to include libpython and initialize it in
our <code>main.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To compile against libpython, we'll use
<a href="https://helpmanual.io/man1/python3-config/">python3-config</a> installed
as part of <code>python3-devel</code> to tell us what should be linked
at each step during compilation.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
0
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now as we think about translating the fibonacci implementation,
we want to keep everything as Python objects for as long as
possible. This means passing and receiving
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html">PyObject*</a> to and from
all functions, and converting all C integers to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html">PyLong*</a>, a "subtype" of
<code>PyObject*</code>. You can imagine that everything in Python is
an <code>object</code> until you operate on it.</p>
<p>
  For more information on objects in Python, check out
  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data
  model</a> page in Python docs.
</p><p>To map a C integer to a <code>PyLong*</code> we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong">PyLong_FromLong</a>. To
map in reverse, we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsLong">PyLong_AsLong</a>.</p>
<p>To compare two <code>PyObject*</code>s we can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_RichCompareBool">PyObject_RichCompareBool</a>
which will handle the comparison regardless of the type of the two
parameters. Without this helper we'd have to write complex checks to
make sure that the two sides are the same and if they are, unwrap them
into their underlying C value and compare the C value.</p>
<p>We can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add">PyNumber_Add</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Subtract">PyNumber_Subtract</a>
for basic arithmetic, and there are many similar helpers available to
us for operations down the line.</p>
<p>Now we can write a translation:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

PyObject* fib(PyObject* n) {
  PyObject* zero = PyLong_FromLong(0);
  PyObject* one = PyLong_FromLong(1);
  if (PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, zero, Py_EQ) || PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, one, Py_EQ)) {
    return n;
  }

  PyObject* left = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, one));

  PyObject* two = PyLong_FromLong(2);
  PyObject* right = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, two));

  return PyNumber_Add(left, right);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  PyObject* res = fib(PyLong_FromLong(7)); // Should be 13

  return PyLong_AsLong(res);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
13
</code></pre>
<p>That's great! But we cheated in one place. We assumed that the input
to the <code>fib</code> function was an integer, and we propagated
that assumption everywhere we wrote <code>PyNumber_*</code>
operations. When we write the compiler, we'll need to check that both
arguments are an integer before we call a numeric helper, otherwise we
may need to call a string concatenation helper or something else
entirely.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-architecture">Compiler Architecture</h3><p>We'll break the code into four major parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>libpyc.c</code>: helper functions for generated code</li>
<li><code>pyc/context.py</code>: utilities for scope and writing code in memory</li>
<li><code>pyc/codegen.py</code>: for generating C code from a Python AST</li>
<li><code>pyc/__main__.py</code>: the entrypoint</li>
</ol>
<p>
  When I'm writing a new compiler using an existing parser I almost
  always start with the entrypoint and code generator so I can explore
  the AST. However, it's easiest to explain the code if we start with
  the utilities first.
</p><p>We'll also want an empty <code>pyc/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="libpyc.c">libpyc.c</h3><p>This C file will contain three helper functions for safely adding,
subtracting, and printing. It will be concatenated to the top of the
generated C file. We'll only support integers for now but this
structure sets us up for supporting more types later on.</p>
<p>We'll use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_Check">PyLong_Check</a>
before calling number-specific methods.</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

inline PyObject* PYC_Add(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Add(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Sub(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Subtract(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Print(PyObject* o) {
  PyObject_Print(o, stdout, Py_PRINT_RAW);
  printf("\n");
  return Py_None;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! We could generate these as strings in Python but it gets
hairy to do so. By using a dedicated C file, we can take advantage of
syntax highlighting since this file is only C code. And since we've
marked all functions as <code>inline</code>, there's no runtime cost
to using not embedding these as strings in Python.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/context.py">pyc/context.py</h3><p>This file will contain a <code>Context</code> class for managing
identifiers in scope and for proxying to a <code>Writer</code> class
that contains helpers for writing lines of C code.</p>
<p>We'll have two instances of the <code>Writer</code> class in
<code>Context</code> so that we can write to a body (or
current/primary) region and an initialization region.</p>
<p>The initialization region is necessary in case there are any variables
declared at the top-level. We can't initialize these variables in C
outside of a function since every <code>PyObject*</code> must be
created after calling <code>Py_Initialize</code>. This section will be
written into our C <code>main</code> function before we enter a
compiled Python <code>main</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>import copy


class Writer():
    content = ""

    def write(self, exp: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.content += ("  " * indent) + exp

    def writeln(self, stmt: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.write(stmt + "\n", indent)

    def write_statement(self, stmt: str, indent: int = 0):

</code></pre>
<p>This is all pretty boring boilerplate. Let's move on.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py">pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py</h3><p>The entrypoint is responsible for reading source code, parsing it,
calling the code generator, writing the source code to a C file, and
compiling it.</p>
<p>First, we read and parse the source code:</p>
<pre><code>import ast
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

from context import Context
from codegen import generate

BUILTINS = {
    "print": "PYC_Print",
}


def main():
    target = sys.argv[1]
    with open(target) as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = ast.parse(source, target)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we write <code>libpyc.c</code> into the body, register builtins,
and run code generation:</p>
<pre><code>
...

def main()
    ...

    ctx = Context()
    with open("libpyc.c") as f:
        ctx.body_write(f.read() + "\n")

    for builtin, fn in BUILTINS.items():
        ctx.register_global(builtin, fn)

    generate(ctx, tree)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a clean output directory and write
<code>main.c</code> with the generated code and a <code>main</code>
function to initialization Python and any global variables:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
   ...

    # Create and move to working directory
    outdir = "bin"
    shutil.rmtree(outdir, ignore_errors=True)
    os.mkdir(outdir)
    os.chdir(outdir)

    with open("main.c", "w") as f:
        f.write(ctx.body.content)

        main = ctx.namings.get("main")["name"]
        f.write(f"""int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {{
  Py_Initialize();

  // Initialize globals, if any.
{ctx.initializations.content}
  PyObject* r = {main}();
  return PyLong_AsLong(r);
}}""")
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we run <code>clang-format</code> and <code>gcc</code> against
the generated C code:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
    ...

    subprocess.run(["clang-format", "-i", "main.c"])

    cflags_raw = …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/>
August 23, 2020 | https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-sdk-gdpr | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-sdk-gdpr">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><b>Skip to the end if you just want a template for a "Right to object"
letter.</b></p>

<p>The .NET Core software development kit (SDK) is a set of command line tools
that allow development against Microsoft's .NET. When the command line tool is
run it sends some telemetry back to Microsoft.</p>

<p>This telemetry is <a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry">documented</a>, however the way it is implemented appears
against the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> in multiple ways.</p>

<h3>Collection by default</h3>

<p>Running <code>dotnet help</code> on a clean install, will print a message about telemetry,
but will send the details on that run.</p>

<p><a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-help.png"><img src="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-help.png"></a></p>

<p>Therefore the GDPR requriements under <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-42/">"Burden of proof and requirements for
consent"</a> cannot be met -- even if we
give Microsoft the benefit of doubt and consider a command line application
somewhat special, it does not give us a chance to opt-out, yet alone opt-in.</p>

<p><a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-installer.png"><img src="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-installer.png"></a></p>

<p>During the installation process, there is a link to Microsoft's <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">Privacy
statement</a>, however this
does not mention the environment variable needed to opt-out, so there is no way
to opt out before the first piece of data is sent.</p>

<h3>Collecting personal data</h3>

<p>The linked information page, as well as the text printed  in the CLI both say "The data is
anonymous.", it clearly isn't. They collect MAC addresses and the current
working directory, which are sent to their servers hashed.</p>

<p>A key thing to understand: <b>Hashing without a salt does not make the data
anonymous or even pseudonymous.</b></p>

<p>See for example <a href="https://medium.com/@alexewerlof/gdpr-pseudonymization-techniques-62f7b3b46a56">GDPR pseudonymisation
techniques</a>.
Given this, it is a clear violation as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article
6</a> requires specific purposes for processing,
but the data was claimed to be anonymous, which it isn't.</p>

<p>A common place to run "dotnet help" might be a home directory, which can often
include a username, e.g. <code>/home/dgl</code>. So while it's hashed it is easily
possible to find the hash that relates to a particular user:</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd
/home/dgl
$ echo -n $PWD | sha256sum
67acfe0ddd44867e1e5da5ddaf25a5b90e928f523cecf614e201c683b7533cf6  -
</code>
</pre>

<p>This matches the relevant part of the JSON sent:</p>

<pre><code>  "Current Path Hash": "67acfe0ddd44867e1e5da5ddaf25a5b90e928f523cecf614e201c683b7533cf6",
</code></pre>

<p>There are some discussions about the collection of MAC addresses in
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/6145">issue #6145</a> but no
particular reply from Microsoft; people suspect it's a GDPR violation. Note
that under the GDPR there are time limits for replying, so that's another
potential GDPR issue.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/ms-report.txt">report</a> I sent to Microsoft detailed how a
MAC address is likely not even 48-bits of search space, as we know what ones
are assigned, so brute-forcing is quite possible, particularly when combined
with the fact the search space can be reduced by filtering on the path
hash.</p>

<p>One principle of the GDPR is you need to explain why you're collecting
information, Microsoft do in a round about way, rather than on the link
printed by the command (<a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry">https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry</a>) which explains what they are collecting, the "why" is hidden on a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/what-weve-learned-from-net-core-sdk-telemetry/">blog post</a>.</p><p>

It says:
</p><blockquote>
Hashed MAC address â€” Determine a cryptographically (SHA256) anonymous and unique ID for a machine. Useful to determine the aggregate number of machines that use .NET Core. This data will not be shared in the public data releases.
<p>

Hashed current working directory â€” Determine build machines from dev machines using the heuristic of a large number of working directories. This distinction helps explain large #s of builds from a machine.
</p></blockquote>


<p>This shows a clear intention to join the data, for some purposes. The "Hashed
MAC address" is obviously understood to be somewhat sensitive as it mentions
they won't share it. Interestingly the same is not said for the current working
directory, which is also sensitive.</p>

<h3>Privacy policy</h3>

<p>As mentioned Microsoft has a <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">general privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>This could allow some collection, however:</p>

<blockquote>
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you
share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline.
</blockquote>

<p>This behaviour would be GDPR compliant, but the key point is due to the first
collection behaviour of e.g. running <code>dotnet help</code> there is no chance to
decline. So the behaviour of the dotnet tool is inconsistent with their own
privacy policy.</p>

<h3>How to respond?</h3>

<p>I sent a report to Microsoft's security team, because arguably incorrect use of
a cryptographic hashing function (SHA256 of the items, without a salt) is a
"Security Design Flaw" which qualifies under the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core">dotnet 
bug bounty</a>. This was
obviously fishing a bit, and Microsoft denied me. More surpsingly they don't
seem to consider this a problem at all, their final reply was:</p>

<blockquote>
We have updates scheduled for the first run experience and related documentation to make it more accurate. Personal data is handled consistently with GDPR requirements.
</blockquote>

<p>You'll notice that they don't talk about any actual collection changes. Also
interestingly if the data is anonymous as they claim, what "Personal data" are
they referring to in this reply?</p>

<h4>What's the route the GDPR gives us here?</h4>

<p>This is an interesting one, partly <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/">Article 11 Processing which does not
  require identification</a> could apply, in that they can exclude themselves
from right of access, etc. With the exception of "Right to object".</p>

<p>There are two routes, either we give enough information for Microsoft to be
happy we identify ourselves (and use the right to erasure), or we use the right
to object, which while it doesn't require Microsoft to delete the data
entirely does require them to limit their use of it.</p>

<p>So I can object to any processing of my data, and as I've proved we can use
the MAC address to find my machine in their data. I believe given this has gone
on for several years that even if they make the data collection GDPR compliant,
there is a huge historical collection of data that may need clearing as it has
been collected unlawfully.</p>

<p>In my original <a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/ms-report.txt">report</a> to Microsoft I made some recommendations:</p>

<pre><code>
Recommendations:
<ul><li>Remove the telemetry, it avoids any potential GDPR issues;</li>
<li>Delete the historical data (I am not a lawyer, but I suspect this has GDPR
implications);
</li></ul></code></pre>

<p>It appears they do not intend to follow these so I suggest that any user of
.NET Core SDK in the European Union takes matters into their own hands and use
their right to object:</p>

<div>
<p>
[Your full address]
[The date]</p>

<p>To Data Controller, Microsoft Corporation</p>

<p>I am exercising my right to object under the General Data Protection
Regulation (Article 21).</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that Microsoft .NET Core SDK collects telemetry,
and the opt-out process for this data is flawed.</p>

<p>In particular setting the <code>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT</code> variable
is only suggested the first time the tool is run, so some data may have been
collected against my will.</p>

<p>In light of Microsoft not deleting this telemetry data for everyone (per the
report of David Leadbeater on 3 August 2020). I wish that my telemetry data is
restricted from further processing, as I have set the opt-out environment
variable, but I cannot be sure that some data has not reached Microsoft
already.</p>

<p>The MAC addresses of my machine(s) is/are:</p>

<p>XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</p>

<p>I believe this is enough to identify my records, as they are stored as a
SHA256 hash of this MAC address.</p>

<p>Please send a full response within one calendar month confirming if you will
comply with my request. If you cannot respond within that timescale, please
tell me when you will be able to respond.</p>

<p>If there is anything you would like to discuss, please contact me.</p>

<p>Thank you,
</p></div>

<p>Obviously the somewhat strange thing about this is you reveal your MAC
address to Microsoft in the process, but I'm fairly sure the data protection
around GDPR requests is something that is well scrutinized.</p>

<p>If you do want to send this to Microsoft go to
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/concern/privacy">https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/concern/privacy</a> and select "I want to contact
Microsoftâ€™s Data Protection Officer".</p>

<p>It's strange this is still an issue as this was previously discussed over
two years ago (see this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17177241">Hacker News
thread</a>). Let's use our right to object!</p>

    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2020</time>
    </p>
    

<p>I quit my job in January 2020 to build a privacy friendly photo organizer.</p>

<p>As a 30 year old whose friends are either getting married or planning
off-springs, what I had underestimated was the difficulty involved in finding a co-founder and how that would compound the difficulty involved in
finding an investor.</p>

<p>Once I accepted the loneliness and the lack of a financial cushion I had to figure out a way to keep building without burning myself out.</p>

<p>It took me a while, but I have found a rhythm that works, and with it, a steady
source of endorphins. Here are some changes that helped me to keep things
moving.</p>

<h2 id="being-patient">Being patient</h2>

<p>Life is no longer as comfortable as it used to be and things are not always
going the way I want them to. Preseverance has been key and indirectly patience
too. Naval’s <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289" target="_blank">take on
meditation</a> (60 minutes x
60 days), was an eye opener. I’ve stuck with it since, and I now have an easier
time identifying negative thought patterns and sitting out situations that would
otherwise overwhelm me.</p>

<p>On some level, spending the last few months locked indoors with my parents, who
are not the most rational people in the world has also helped. But I wouldn’t
recommend it.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-procrastination">Reducing procrastination</h2>

<p>Over time I’ve realized that action precedes motivation and procrastination precedes guilt.</p>

<p>Breaking down tasks into chunks that seem trivial to accomplish has helped reduce the friction in getting started on unexciting grunt work.</p>

<p>Then there are tasks which I loathe from my core, like writing out applications
to VCs explaining why what I’m doing will matter. To those I attach reinforcing
personal reasons, like, “I need the $50k to hire that college junior who I love
working with, and that will give me spare bandwidth to focus on traction channels”.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-clearer">Thinking clearer</h2>

<p>It is sub-optimal to not have a coworker to bounce ideas off and rant about problems to. A lot of times it’s these conversations that help you gain clarity.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury I do not have so every time I feel stuck, I type/scribble my thoughts out, and then question everything that was written, and then document my realizations.</p>

<p>Task tracking has also helped in clearing the path. I write down unstructured
thoughts into a diary, and once I’ve clarity, I promote them to a Notion board
(that’s divided into <em>Thinking</em>, <em>Building</em>, <em>Reading</em>, <em>Writing</em> and
<em>Adulting</em>) and every Monday within an Excel sheet I track what was done, and
what is left to be done.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-distractions">Reducing distractions</h2>

<p>I’ve reduced my information consumption to free up brain cycles. I’ve disabled all notifications on my phone barring a few contacts, and I’ve more or less stopped browsing on it. As an added bonus, this has reduced the negativity with which I perceived the world.</p>

<p>To minimize the overhead of context switches, I split tasks into a tree of checkpoints. Before taking a break I note down the next simplest checkpoint so that when I get back to work there’s little friction to resume.</p>

<p>To help me zone out I keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A" target="_blank">lofi
beats</a> or
<a href="http://github.audio/" target="_blank">github.audio</a> playing in the background. Listening to the
latter gives me a strange sense of motivation and makes me feel less alone.</p>

<h2 id="staying-grounded">Staying grounded</h2>

<p>I’m lucky to have some friends who call/text every other week. I look at them as my accountability partners and I talk to them about what I’m doing on a high level. While not all of them genuinely care, some do, and these conversations force me to reflect on how well I’m doing what I’m doing.</p>

<p>While Silicon Valley wisdom suggests that if I’m not sleeping I should be
working, failing because of a burn out would be stupid. An advantage of not
having a VC onboard so far has been the freedom to dictate my pace. So I spend
days thinking, reading, fiddling with my violin or just doing nothing when I
feel like writing code is not what I want to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s been 7 months of building alone, and while this is not how I pictured things to be on my last day at work, this is the happiest I have ever been. There’s a long way to go, and the grind seems inviting.</p>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, for I’m still learning. If you’ve
anything to share, please join <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24251403" target="_blank">the discussion on HackerNews</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have noticed the incredible misinformation being spread in the lay news. From the New York Times, to CNN, to Fox News, to Donald Trump himself- GIANT, OBVIOUS, LIES and ERRORS have been spread to the public. From Masks don’t work, to Hydroxychloroquine is an effective drug, to COVID-19 is a hoax, to antibodies won’t last, to the latest set of lies- herd immunity isn’t happening– all giant lies– on both sides of the aisle. Many of these have been attributed to scientists or academics with one line out-of-context quotes, throwing us under the bus, saying things we didn’t say, blatantly misconstruing or outright not understanding the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> behind basic concepts. The lies always fall along party lines and are aimed at manipulating the public for a political agenda. Scientists have become both pawns and scapegoats to the media and politicians. I am really, really, tired of it. And it is <strong>literally KILLING Americans.</strong></p>



<p>Without facts, we can’t have rationale policy and people can’t make informed, consenting, decisions about their health. The media lies have created mass public confusion and engendered incredible mistrust of the media, politicians, and scientists and doctors (the people the public can and should trust). All the while the scientific community has had a clear eyed unchanging picture of this pandemic the whole time. The virus is not so complicated. The modeling of the virus is actually not so complicated. But if you are listening to the press, it’s a huge messy complicated whiplash of completely untrustworthy information. </p>



<p>So here are the <span><strong>Five Biggest Lies </strong></span>about COVID-19 spread by the press and politicians:</p>



<p>1.<strong>Masks don’t work. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Everyone. </p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> To manipulate the public into not buying N95 masks so health care workers would have them. </p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> It made millions of Americans not believe masks work when the media about faced on this later, killing 10s of thousands. 30% less people would die if everyone wore masks. </p>



<p><strong>2. Hydroxychloroquine works.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Trump and the right. </p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> I really can’t fucking figure it out for the life of me. Trump has some financial interest in the drug? You tell me.</p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> People around the world took a bogus drug with real <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/09/elementor-1270/">harmful side effects to their hearts and livers</a>. They also had a false sense of security that there is a treatment for COVID.</p>



<p>Some politicians (below for Ted Cruz statement), have finally admitted the harm in Hydroxycholorquine saying it directly is killing people but still cling to promoting the drug for earlier treatment despite the rigorous clinical trials showing no benefit and indeed harm with the drug. <a href="https://thetexan.news/ted-cruz-letter-to-fda-says-hydroxychloroquine-restrictions-may-be-directly-costing-lives/">https://thetexan.news/ted-cruz-letter-to-fda-says-hydroxychloroquine-restrictions-may-be-directly-costing-lives/</a>.</p>



<p><strong>3. COVID-19 is a hoax.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Trump and the right.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> My suspicion is that they care more about keeping businesses (and their own finances) intact than saving human lives. So they want people to think COVID-19 is not dangerous so people will continue to spend money.</p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> People went about their lives in many states like the virus wasn’t harmful. This killed 100,000 more people than necessary. COVID-19 has already killed 6X the number of people this year than the flu has on average in any given year. It also very well might encourage people not to get a COVID vaccine when it becomes available- which we very much need to do.</p>



<p><strong>4. Antibodies won’t last so herd immunity might not be possible.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> The left using scientists as pawns. Here is a quote from a review in the journal, Nature, the number one <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> journal in the world. Please note the use of “predictable” in the tagline- “Viral Immunologists say that results so far have been predictable- Here’s why that’s good news”. <strong>This pandemic has not been mysterious to scientists.</strong></p>







<figure><blockquote><p>“Several major media outlets reported this as a loss of immunity, saying that it would complicate vaccine efforts.Many immunologists found that declaration a bit premature, however. The data showed a perfectly normal response to a viral infection, says Luis Barreiro at the University of Chicago in Illinois, who studies the evolution of immune responses to pathogens. When a virus attacks, it spurs the proliferation of B cells that produce antibodies capable of recognizing pieces of the virus. But once the infection is gone, antibody levels typically wane. “There is a lot of fear out there,” says Miles Carroll, an infectious-disease specialist with Public Health England in Porton Down, UK. “But I think, on the whole, that it’s a fairly robust immune response.””</p><cite>~Nature NEWS&nbsp;&nbsp;17 AUGUST 2020<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02400-7">What the immune response to the coronavirus says about the prospects for a vaccine<br>Viral immunologists say that results so far have been predictable — here’s why that’s good news.</a></p></cite></blockquote></figure><p><strong>5. Herd immunity isn’t happening because there are still cases. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Who is spreading this?</strong> The left and Cuomo and crew. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/21/health/coronavirus-immunity-frieden-opinion/index.html">CNN</a> and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-11/san-quentin-coronavirus-herd-immunity-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR3hDfD6XqUIv7vydOLl5cga3mlKV_TOgh0eqrgZVpMNDeBGocpC6tI8UKI">LA Times</a> have blatant lies in papers in the last two days. Here is a quote from CNN showing that they are lying about what herd immunity is. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“But can herd immunity result from 20-30% infection, as some misguided academics suggested recently—far lower than the usual estimate of 60-80% infection? Don’t count on it. Some communities already have a 50% infection rate or higher — this would be impossible if herd immunity kicked in at a 20-30% infection rate!”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Herd immunity means cases go down, RT&lt;1, not that they disappear or that more immunity isn’t possible. This definition is literally in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>Herd immunity <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/17/why-i-believe-the-us-has-herd-immunity-in-some-states-and-is-barreling-towards-it-as-a-country/">is almost certainly happening</a>. <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/19/all-signs-point-to-herd-immunity-happening-in-parts-of-the-us-what-are-the-practical-implications/">And that is a good reason to wear a mask and not open schools. </a>Things aren’t safe yet but could be soon- we need to be careful for one more semester and ride this out- but also have hope that things will be better soon.</p>



<p><strong>Why? </strong>Because they want to protect Andrew Cuomo from the wrath of the public finding out that NYC has had herd immunity all along. They also want to point fingers at the right that their cases are going up because they are holier than thou and are using that politically. </p>



<p><strong>What is the harm?</strong> It gives the public the exact opposite impression of what is happening. New York is amongst the safer states now and Michigan is amongst the least safe. States with schools opening that do not yet have immunity should 100% not open. University of Michigan, with your 60k plus students, do not open! Take a clue from UNC Chapel Hill shutting down after one week of classes. </p>



<p>This reckless, abhorrent, blatantly false, characterization of COVID-19 and public health messaging is incredibly harmful. It has killed ~100,000 Americans. The press and politicians on both sides of the aisle need to be held accountable for this. #fakesciencenews</p>

<p>Currently, github runners are hosted on azure <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners">Standard_DS2_v2 VMs</a>. They have 2vCPU 7GB RAM and 14GB SSD.</p>

<p>You can self-host a runner by installing the runner service on your own infrastructure. Self-hosted runners incur no costs on github and allow you to leverage the actions api. Of course you’ll be paying for your own infrastructure, but often this will be cheaper than burning through github minutes. If you’ve got a couple idle ubuntu boxes lying around the office it’s an easy win.</p>

<p>I would recommend using a ramdisk for the workers <code>_work</code> dir as it will dramatically increase IO. Since our tests are ephemeral anyway, we don’t care if there is data loss in the <code>_work</code> directory. Any important files can be persisted using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts">github artifacts</a>.</p>

<p>If your workflow is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/about-service-containers#running-jobs-in-a-container">container-job</a>, then the only dependencies are ubuntu and docker. Assuming you’ve got stock ubuntu 18.04 installed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
# requires reboot
sudo usermod -a -G docker fred


# create a ramdisk for the runners work dir
mkdir /home/fred/ramdisk
sudo chown -R fred /home/fred/ramdisk

# requires reboot
echo "tmpfs /home/fred/ramdisk tmpfs   defaults,size=3000M,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000   0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# set up the github runner
# in this example we are installing a runner to a repository, you can also install it for a org
# more info https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners
mkdir actions-runner
cd actions-runner
# note the version will most likely change in the future
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.272.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.272.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.272.0.tar.gz
# you can find the token here: https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/actions/add-new-runner
./config.sh --url https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt; --token "${GITHUB_TOKEN}" --name "${RUNNER_NAME}" --work /home/fred/ramdisk  --unattended  --replace
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s it. You should now see the runner in your repo: e.g <code>https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/actions</code></p>

<p>To tie your workflow to a self-hosted runner, use a label e.g</p>

<pre><code>jobs:
    server_tests:
        runs-on: [self-hosted, enabled]
</code></pre>

<p>You might be wondering if you can host the github runner in a docker container. Unfortunately not all features are supported yet, so depending on your workflow you might have <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/406">issues</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Startomatic perspective:</strong></p>

<p>Stripe Atlas is a startup formation product aimed at venture capital-backed companies. These companies typically need somewhat complex legal documents allowing for outside investment, multiple types of equity, and equity compensation. Stripe Atlas only allows formation of Delaware C-corporations. They also offer to set up a US bank account for users.</p>

<p>For companies not planning to immediately raise outside investment, Stripe Atlas is somewhat expensive and offers limited choices - you cannot form an S-corporations, LLC, or entity in any state other than Delaware.</p>

<p>Stripe Atlas does not offer logo, website, trademark searches, domain name registration, company email, SEO help, or any of the numerous other features included in Startomatic’s flat fee.</p>

<p>If you are not planning to immediately raise money from professional investors, you’re not operating in Delaware, and/or you need services other than legal formation documents and a bank account, Stripe Atlas may not be a good choice. Startomatic is both less expensive and provides significantly more features, including the ability to incorporate in all 50 states.</p>

				<div>
					<p>I love reading. But retaining what I read tends to be a challenge. I usually walk away from a book feeling good but with only a faint idea of what was in there. Heck, if I spend a couple hours online I’ll barely remember what articles I read! And it’s not just me, studies show that <a href="https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1379/brain-science-the-forgetting-curvethe-dirty-secret-of-corporate-training">you only retain a tiny percentage of what you read</a>.</p><p>I hated the idea of wasting all that time I spent reading, so a year ago I started looking into ways to retain what I learned.</p><p>My first attempt led me to Farnam Street’s tips on <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/05/remembering-what-you-read/">remembering what you read</a>. Their concept of writing your notes on the book itself was liberating (it’s okay to WRITE in my book?!?). Actively writing down notes helped me get more insights out of the text, but those thoughts would then be trapped in the analogue world, locked away until I happened to peruse the book some time in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png 769w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>FS also suggested writing down the book’s core ideas from memory right after you finish the book, but this is a process that requires discipline (unless you like testing yourself?) and things requiring discipline have a distressing tendency to not happen.</p><p>Those tips were exciting, but I couldn’t stick with it. I needed something different.</p><p>Next I came across the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten note taking method</a>. Its core idea is to create atomic notes, where each note is about exactly one topic (not more than a few paragraphs tops) and nothing more. Then you file the away in your system by linking that note to other notes which seem most relevant to it. All the notes are written in your own words, so you’re really writing down your own thoughts here.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 616w"></figure><p>The key here is that the linking process <strong><strong>groups relevant notes together</strong></strong>. Now when you’re interested in browsing your notes on a given topic, you’ll easily find them. You get to see how your ideas relate to each other as well as discover interesting ways they may play off against or even contradict one another.</p><p>But this technique is time intensive. You have to:</p><ul><li>Save the initial note, paraphrasing what you learned</li><li>Search for relevant notes to link it to</li><li>Potentially update your table of contents to find that note more easily later on</li></ul><p>If you take a lot of notes, the stream of incoming notes can quickly leave you overwhelmed. This technique requires time and dedication.</p><p>I couldn’t stick with it.</p><p>Finally I discovered Building a Second Brain and it’s <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">P.A.R.A</a> technique. It offers an easier option for busy people.</p><p>With P.A.R.A. you organize all your notes by purpose, not by category. Let’s say you’re trying to build an app. You’ll have a folder called ‘app’ for all notes about it. Now if you study databases in order to build it, you’ll file any notes you take inside the ‘app’ folder, not in a separate ‘databases’ folder.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What does this do? By creating purpose-based folders and putting all notes related to that <em>purpose</em> inside it, we’ve created a new way to group relevant notes together. All your notes related to that purpose are available front and center when you open the folder. This lets you avoid the time consuming process of sorting, organizing, and linking your notes in order to make them useful. Just drop the note in the right folder and BAM, that’s it.</p><p>How do you reference old notes? When you start working on a new project (like a writing assignment) you search the relevant folders and pull out notes that seem relevant to your task. All those notes will go into the new project’s folder. You’re effectively discovering related notes on the fly. You’ve avoided the work of double linking and cross referencing your notes. This solution gets you 80% of the way there with 20% of the effort. Just in Time linking.</p><p>When you finish a project, you file away the notes from that project in which ever folder you think they’ll be most useful in, and then archive the project folder. Now you’ve reset the notes to be discoverable the next time you need them.</p><p>And it’s not just good for retention. I’m finding that this purpose-based organization is helping me work much more productively on all my projects!</p><p>Even the step of summarizing what you read is optimized for efficiency. It’s called <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/">Progressive Summarization</a></p><p>With progressive summarization you don’t bother summarizing what you’re learning, at least not at first. Instead you take the passages you found most interesting and copy them into your notes. If you ever reread those notes in the future then you can start highlighting the phrases that really spoke to you and if you reread them again, only then will you do the work to summarize the ideas in your own words.</p><p>It’s not that summarizing your notes from the beginning is bad, but if you procrastinate on it while still expecting yourself to do it then you’re setting yourself up for failure. Progressive summarization offers you a way to delay summarization while still retaining value.</p><p>Note what’s happened here: Instead of forcing myself to be disciplined about organizing my notes, P.A.R.A. + Progressive Summarization takes advantage of the times when I’m <strong><strong>already excited to work on them</strong></strong>. Each time I touch the notes, I have to take a small amount of effort which is proportionate to my level of interest in the task. <strong><strong>We’ve replaced forced discipline with leveraged excitement.</strong></strong></p><p>There is one other critical aspect of PARA that’s required to keep the system from being overwhelming. Successful followers of the Zettelkasten method seem to follow this instinctively, but <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">it’s rarely mentioned</a>:</p><p>You’re highly encouraged to <strong><strong>limit</strong></strong> the kind of things you save in your second brain to the following:</p><ul><li>Things related to projects you’re <em>actively</em> working on. Don’t store trivia</li><li>Store things that surprise you: Don’t store stuff you already know</li><li>A 12 select problems that you love to think about</li></ul><p>Tiago recommends thinking about <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-use-evernote-for-your-creative-workflow/">the 12 problems you care most about</a> and <em>only</em> store things related to those problems in your notebook (so skip the articles about ancient mummies…unless you’re an archaeologist).</p><p>By limiting which topics you put in your second brain you free up more cognitive space to notice what you do store. By storing less you’ll remember more 🤯</p><p>Not making your second brain cognitively overwhelming is an under-emphasized part of the PARA system. There shouldn’t be anything in your project’s section unless you are actively working on it. Even the other sections are also meant to be pruned on a regular basis so that they only represent your primary interests. A good rule of thumb: if any folder gains more notes than you can easily skim (~50-100 notes), it might be time to split that folder into two or maybe even delete some notes.</p><p>This is by no means a complete comparison of Zettlekasten and P.A.R.A. (that would be a much longer essay) but it captures the major points.</p><p>Zettelkasten has its benefits: If you want to be able to casually browse through your notes, looking for ideas to spark your imagination, Zettelkasten will most likely have superior results since the ideas are already summarized right there for you. Zettelkasten makes it easy to compose essays and put together speeches, but that’s because you’ve already done the hard work of writing down your thoughts ahead of time.</p><p>It’s requirement to link all notes ahead of time is a HUGE barrier to entry, so Zettlekasten may be best suited to people with a strong research oriented disposition who’re already used to similar practices. The fact that there’s no good software available to help with this makes the process even harder. (Check out <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma">Andy Matuschak’s notes</a> for a gorgeous Zettlekasten example)</p><p>P.A.R.A. is great for those who don’t have the time (or willpower) to force themselves to write down notes they may never use. Instead it’s Just-in-Time philosophy saves many hours and lets you be more productive. Tiago has designed P.A.R.A. to work with most productivity apps, but the process is optimized for his app of choice: Evernote.</p><p>All in all, I’m finding P.A.R.A. pretty useful so far. It has yet to pass the ultimate test of any knowledge management system: Will I still be using it three months from now? (ask me after July). I’m already noticing productivity boosts by using the PARA method to store notes for all my projects, so prospects are looking good 😁</p>

        <p>When we write thoughts and ideas down with words for future recollection and synthesis, we take the stuff of abstract concepts, and collapse them down into a one-dimensional string of characters. For even the best, most careful writers, I think our ideas lose a lot of fidelity in this dramatic reduction in expressiveness of thoughts and their relationships to each other.</p>
<p>Our thoughts <em>in vivo</em> take on all kinds of shapes, and are connected in a myriad of relationships – by analogy, by example, by superset/subset relations, and so on. When we taxidermy them out onto paper or through the keyboard, we’re forced to flatten these relationships out onto a single dimension, usually nested bulleted links with verbal references  that leap across the page arbitrarily to connect related ideas to each other. Just think of the last time you jot down an idea in your note-taking method of choice – how much freedom did the medium afford you? At best, you’re writing freeform, pen-on-paper, and you draw arrows between related ideas and underline the important parts; typing on a keyboard into a text box is even more restrictive.</p>
<p>The internal structure of individual ideas vary even more greatly. Some thoughts contain lists of things, others are about comparisons between categories of things, and there are probably many more that can’t be named or enumerated or denoted with just a few lines going across the page between sentences. The state of the art in high-fidelity recording of our thoughts, in my opinion, is still handwriting on paper (or your digital handwriting app of choice). But here, we effectively lose our ability to search through information quickly, when we need it, because unlike bulleted lists, the information we hand-write isn’t <em>structured</em>.</p>
<p>This yields the question, <strong>how should we store and retrieve ideas in written form, so our workflows better preserve the living structure of thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/structured-thought.jpg" alt="Structured thought">
</p>
<p>I’ve previously noted <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/abstraction/">the parallelism and contrast between programming and written languages</a>. I think the more precise, multi-dimensional language of computers may be better suited for articulating relationships between our ideas in the written form.</p>
<h2 id="structured-thought">Structured thought</h2>
<p>Why might programming languages be better suited for recording relationships between ideas than the written word?</p>
<p>One reason is that programming languages are purpose-designed for building up living data structures. Programs, in their normal course of life, build up precise lists and trees and other complex structures of values. If there were a programming language as such, whose primitive values were units of thought or ideas instead of integers and strings and arrays, would we be able to record and retrieve our past ideas more effectively? In other words, what if there was some sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a> for better note-taking? Can we view the macro-structure of our thoughts as a highly specialized, highly complex data structure that we can encode into programs? Probably not entirely, but for the more analytical ideas, I think it’s a thought experiment we can entertain using new and interesting tools.</p>
<p>The most promising tool I’ve found exploring this direction is <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. It stores ideas in a fluid, cross-linkable and searchable database of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. But Roam is still pretty restricted to nested relationships and bidirectional links between ideas (though I admittedly haven’t tried it in depth). I think there’s lots of headroom here in the market for exploring more general data structures for ideas, and for allowing note-takers to create their own structures and layouts.</p>
<h2 id="a-runtime-for-human-abstractions">A runtime for human abstractions</h2>
<p>I think an ideal future extension of this idea isn’t just a written format that can be queried like Roam or some kind of a programming language, but an omnipresent, ambient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system"><em>runtime</em></a> for our thoughts and ideas – one that can interact fluidly with our environment and context, and maybe even preempt our recollections and augment our ability to sift through our ideas from the past and present.</p>
<p>Sci-fi literature has imagined an endless taxonomy of ways for humans to externalize our minds onto offboard computers and networks of mechanical brains, most of which yield the control of our memory storage and recollection to some artificial and autonomous system. But I think there are ways to extend our minds using more primitive tools like better notes, and a more carefully crafted runtime for structured thought. One where we continue to drive interactions with our memory, albeit with more powerful tools in hand to record what we think, and remember them at the right times, when we need them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>The new buzz word in town is the term CTO. As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever inspires to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>

<li>
<p>Challenges</p>
</li>

<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9pg24tufqwzoog/expansion.png?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that To sum this part up</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>

Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine.

In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers.

It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually.

Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G).

Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no? (In that instance, I said no, and added a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a> that would block new advertiser access at the page level.)</p><h2 id="recreating-simplicity">Recreating simplicity</h2><blockquote><p>You cannot get a simple system by adding simplicity to a complex system. - <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-March/065087.html">Richard O’Keefe</a></p></blockquote><p>Where do we go from here? Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>2020: an isolation odyssey</em> is a reenactment of the iconic finale of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). Restaged in the context of home quarantine, the journey through time adapts to the mundane dramas of self-isolation–poking fun at the navel-gazing saga of life alone and indoors.</p>

<p>This project began in late March and was completed in late May, spanning the height of the pandemic in New York City. Staged in a one bedroom Brooklyn apartment, <em>2020</em> presents an obvious similarity to the domestic setting of <em>2001</em>. The stacked videos and synced movements also reveal parallels in emotion. The narrowness of daily life in a single space, transitioning from confusion to acceptance, a distorted sense of time, and ‘returning’ after a transformational event–all experiences analogous to quarantine. </p>

<p>The adapted version delineates the passing of time through wardrobe rather than age, identifying each phase of the character’s journey with a product of self care or PPE. Tools of private entertainment or self betterment are also used as props, questioning our confidence in products and productivity as anchors during times of uncertainty. Multitasking while #wfh, conjuring guilt or longing with unused exercise equipment, your entire being reduced to a measure of time–these scenes all illustrate the absurd comedy of trying to maintain control during this unprecedented and unpredictable time.<br>

<p>A lot of people don’t realize that there are general purpose problem solving techniques that cut across domains. They can help you deal with thorny challenges in work, your personal life, startups, or even if you’re trying to prove a new theorem in math.</p>



<p>Below are the 26 general purpose problem solving techniques that I like best, along with a one-word name I picked for each, and hypothetical examples to illustrate what sort of strategy I’m referring to.</p>



<p>Consider opening up this list whenever you’re stuck solving a challenging problem. It’s likely that one or more of these techniques can help!</p>



<h4>General Purpose Techniques for Solving Challenging Problems of All Kinds</h4>



<p>1. <strong>Clarifying</strong> – try to define the problem you are facing as precisely as you can, maybe by writing down a detailed description of exactly what the problem is and what constraints exist for a solution, or by describing it in detail to another person, which may lead to you realizing the problem is not quite what you had thought, or that it has a more obvious solution than you thought.</p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“I thought that I needed to find a new job, but when I thought really carefully about what I don’t like about my current job, I realized that I could likely fix those things by talking to my boss or even, potentially, just by thinking about them differently.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“we thought we had a problem with users not wanting to sign up for the product, but when we carefully investigated what the problem really was, we discovered it was actually more of a problem of users wanting the product but then growing frustrated because of bad interface design.”</em></p>



<p>2. <strong>Subdividing</strong> – break the problem down into smaller problems in such a way that if you solve each of the small problems, you will have solved the entire problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example:<em> “My goal is to get company Z to become a partner with my company, and that seems hard, so let me break that goal into the steps of (a) listing the ways that company Z would benefit from becoming a partner with us, (b) finding an employee at company Z who would be responsive to hearing about these benefits, and (c) tracking down someone who can introduce me to that employee.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example:<em> “I want to prove that a certain property applies to all functions of a specific type, so I start by (a) showing that every function of that type can be written as a sum of a more specific type of function, then I show that (b) the property applies to each function of the more specific type, and finally I show that (c) if the property applies to each function in a set of functions then it applies to arbitrary sums of those functions as well.”</em></p>



<p>3. <strong>Simplifying </strong>– think of the simplest variation of the problem that you expect you can solve that shares important features in common with your problem, and see if solving this simpler problem gives you ideas for how to solve the more difficult version.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I don’t know how to hire a CTO, but I do know how to hire a software engineer because I’ve done it many times, and good CTOs will often themselves be good software engineers, so how can I tweak my software engineer hiring to make it appropriate for hiring a CTO?”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I don’t know how to calculate this integral as it is, but if I remove one of the free parameters, I actually do know how to calculate it, and maybe doing that calculation will give me insight into the solution of the more complex integral.”</em></p>



<p>4. <strong>Crowd-sourcing</strong> – use suggestions from multiple people to gain insight into how to solve the problem, for instance by posting on Facebook or Twitter requesting people’s help, or by posting to a Q&amp;A site like Quora, or by sending emails to 10 people you know explaining the problem and requesting assistance.</p>



<p>Business Example: <em>“Do you have experience outsourcing manufacturing to China? If so, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts about how to approach choosing a vendor.”</em></p>



<p>Health Example: <em>“I have trouble getting myself to stick to doing exercise daily. If you also used to have trouble getting yourself to exercise but don’t anymore, I’d love to know what worked to make it easier for you.”</em></p>



<p>5. <strong>Splintering</strong> – if the problem you are trying to solve has special cases that a solution to the general problem would also apply to, consider just one or two of these special cases as examples and solve the problem just for those cases first. Then see if a solution to one of those special cases helps you solve the problem in general.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to improve employee retention in general, let me examine how I could have improved retention in the case of the last three people that quit.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to convince a large number of people to become customers, let me first figure out how to convince just Bill and John to become customers since they seem like the sort of customer I want to attract, and see what general lessons I learn from doing that.”</em></p>



<p>6. <strong>Reading</strong> – read the books or textbooks that seems most related to the topic, and see whether they provide a solution to the problem, or teach you enough related information that you can now solve it yourself. </p>



<p>Economics Example: <em>“Economists probably have already figured out reasonable ways to estimate demand elasticity, let’s see what an econometrics textbook says rather than trying to invent a technique from scratch.”</em></p>



<p>Mental Health Example: <em>“I’ve been feeling depressed for a long time, maybe I should read some well-liked books about depression, such as ‘Feeling Good.'”</em></p>



<p>7. <strong>Searching </strong>– think of a similar problem that you think practitioners, bloggers or academics might have already solved and search online (e.g., via google, Q&amp;A sites, or google scholar academic paper search) to see if anyone has done a write-up about how they solved it.</p>



<p>Advertising Example: <em>“I’m having trouble figuring out the right advertising keywords to bid on for my specific product, I bet someone has a blog post describing how to approach choosing keywords for other related products.”</em></p>



<p>Machine Learning Example:<em> “I can’t get this neural network to train properly in my specific case, I wonder if someone has written a tutorial about how to apply neural networks to related problems.”</em></p>



<p>8. <strong>Unconstraining</strong> – list all the constraints of the problem, then temporarily ignore one or more of the constraints that make the problem especially hard, and try to solve it without those constraints. If you can, then see if you can modify that unconstrained solution until it becomes a solution for the fully constrained problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I need to hire someone who can do work at the intersection of machine learning and cryptography, let me drop the constraint of having cryptography experience and recruit machine learning people, then pick from among them a person that seems both generally capable and well positioned to learn the necessary cryptography.”</em></p>



<p>Computer Science Example: <em>“I need to implement a certain algorithm, and it needs to be efficient, but that seems very difficult, so let me first figure out how to implement an inefficient version of the algorithm (i.e., drop the efficiency constraint), then at the end I will try to figure out how to optimize that algorithm for efficiency.”</em></p>



<p>9. <strong>Distracting</strong> – fill your mind with everything you know about the problem, including facts, constraints, challenges, considerations, etc. and then stop thinking about the problem, and go and do a relaxing activity that requires little focus, such as walking, swimming, cooking, napping or taking a bath to see if new ideas or potential solutions pop into your mind unexpectedly as your subconscious continues to work on the problem without your attention.</p>



<p>Example: <em>“For three days, I’ve been trying to solve this problem at work, but the solution only came to me when I was strolling in the woods and not even thinking about it.”</em></p>



<p>Example from mathematician Henri Poincaré: <em>“The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go someplace or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.”</em></p>



<p>10. <strong>Reexamining</strong> – write down all the assumptions you’ve been making about the problem or about what a solution should look like (yes – make an actual list). Then start challenging them one by one to see if they are actually needed or whether some may be unnecessary or mistaken.</p>



<p>Psychology Example: <em>“We were assuming in our lab experiments that when people get angry they have some underlying reason behind it, but there may be some anger that is better modeled as a chemical fluctuation that is only loosely related to what happens in the lab, such as when people are quick to anger because they are hungry.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I need to construct a function that has this strange property, and so far I’ve assumed that the function must be smooth, but if it doesn’t actually need to be then perhaps I can construct just such a function out of simple linear pieces that are glued together.”</em></p>



<p>11.<strong> Reframing</strong> – try to see the problem differently. For instance, by flipping the default, analyzing the inverse of the problem instead, thinking about how you would achieve the opposite of what you want, or shifting to an opposing perspective.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“If we were building this company over again completely from scratch, what would we do differently in the design of our product, and can we pivot the product in that direction right now?”</em></p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“Should move to New York to take a job that pays $20,000 more per year? Well, if I already lived in New York, the decision to stay there rather than taking a $20,000 pay cut to move here would be an easy one. …</em></p></div></div>

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<p>We live in a noisy world.</p>



<p>To cut through this noise and create clarity for those around us, we all need to communicate effectively every day. Our work doesn’t speak for itself; we need to collaborate, inspire, and build relationships. To do this, we need to be able to communicate clearly.</p>



<p>As a shy child and introverted adult, externalizing my perspective never came naturally to me. It still doesn’t. In high school, I had the dubious honor of being cast in the only non-speaking role in drama class. Despite this, today, I spend the majority of my day, every day, communicating with people. In some ways, my day job&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;communication.</p>



<p>Communication is a learned skill. I’m certainly no Obama, but over time, I’ve collected a set of tools that have helped me communicate more effectively.</p>



<h3>Contents</h3>



<ol><li><a href="#rule-of-three">Rule of Three</a></li><li><a href="#answer-explain-example">Answer, Explain, Example</a></li><li><a href="#structure-say-summarize">Structure, Say, Summarize</a></li><li><a href="#feelings-last">Feelings Last Longer Than Words</a></li><li><a href="#pause-context">Pause and Give Context</a></li><li><a href="#so-what">“So What” Is Your One Key Takeaway</a></li></ol>



<h3 id="rule-of-three">Rule of Three</h3>



<p>Three is a magic number in communication. From stories, like The Three Musketeers, Three Blind Mice, and Three Little Pigs, to colloquialisms like “blood, sweat, and tears,” <em>three</em> is everywhere. There’s even a Latin phrase, omne trium perfectum, or <em>everything that comes in threes is perfect</em>.</p>



<p>Why is this? Humans beings seek both patterns and simplicity. We’re pattern-recognition machines, always looking for signals among the noise. Simultaneously, we have limited working memory. We can’t remember a list of fifteen things or even a list of five. But we can remember three, which is the minimum number of objects needed to make a pattern. Three is concise, persuasive, and memorable.</p>



<p>When you say, “there are three reasons we should do this,” people pay attention. They know that three is easy to digest and remember. And you, the speaker, are forced to structure your argument succinctly and compellingly. When you put seven bullet-points in a document or slide, people’s eyes glaze over. When you put a concise list of three, they digest it. Within reason, in verbal or written communication, distill what you have to say down to three.</p>



<h3 id="answer-explain-example">Answer, Explain, Example</h3>



<p>I heard this from a former LinkedIn executive. The premise is simple but powerful. When answering a question, give the answer, then elaborate, then provide an example. That’s it.</p>



<p>By answering the question immediately, you’re getting to the point and giving the person who asked a concise answer. Then you’re supporting it with your rationale. Finally, you’re backing it up with a real example.</p>



<h3 id="structure-say-summarize">Structure, Say, Summarize</h3>



<p>“Structure, Say, Summarize” is a tool I use when communicating something nuanced. The basis is this: First, structure how you’re going to make the statement. Second, make the statement. Third, summarize your position and the “<a href="#so-what">so what</a>.”</p>



<ul><li>Structure: It’s a risk, but there are three reasons we should do this.</li><li>Say: The first reason is X, the second is Y, the third reason is Z.</li><li>Summarize: I know nothing is guaranteed. But, given these reasons, we’re missing an opportunity to grow by not doing this.</li></ul>



<p>This structure is akin to a Dale Carnegie quote: “Tell the audience what you’re going to say, say it; then tell them what you’ve said.”</p>



<p>Verbal communication is messy, and it’s difficult for people to follow spoken paragraphs. Even when you don’t have a tidy list of three, starting with “there are a few reasons,” making stating a few points, then summarizing your view is a powerful way to communicate more clearly.</p>



<p>But don’t use this all the time, or you’ll seem like a robot.</p>



<h3 id="feelings-last">Feelings Last Longer Than Words</h3>



<p>People will often forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made them feel. You might have made a logically sound argument, but if the recipient didn’t feel enthused, inspired, or understood, it probably won’t stick.</p>



<p>Feelings are why the world’s most iconic brands are so effective. We don’t remember every detail, every line of copy, or every number. But they make us feel a certain way, and feelings are sticky.</p>



<p>If you want to inspire action or lead a team, logic is important, but so is ensuring people are inspired when they walk away from an interaction. People won’t remember everything you said, but they’ll remember how you made them feel.</p>



<h3 id="pause-context">Pause and Give Context</h3>



<p>Never assume that everyone has the same context that you do. There’s a magical and straightforward sequence of words for this: “Let me give some context to make sure we’re on the same page.”</p>



<p>In any given conversation, everyone has a perspective formulated from a different set of inputs. The more closely aligned you can get these inputs, the more effective your communication will be. Shared context helps avoid “talking past each other” situations.</p>



<p>One of the tenets of effective communication is <em>over-communication</em>. Most people associate this with being annoying or spam. In my experience, that isn’t true. Over-communication is about never assuming that people have the same context that you do.</p>



<h3 id="so-what">“So What” Is Your One Key Takeaway</h3>



<p>For every piece of communication that you create, find the “so what.” Whether a presentation, document, or slide,&nbsp;if someone asked, “so what?”, what would you say? </p>



<p>Whatever the answer to that question is, make sure it comes across clearly. The answer to “so what?” usually involves articulates the implication for the audience.</p>



<p>An easily applicable tip here is to title your slides or headers with the “so what” for that particular slide or section. Hone in on the most important takeaway and the implication for the audience — why should they care?</p>

<![CDATA[AWS Activate and Our $4k Mistake]]>

August 22, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently we signed up for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> program, which provides startups / small internet businesses like us with a variety of benefits - from AWS credits to free business-tier support.</p>
<p>We signed up for AWS Activate as part of our application to the Stripe Atlas program, which we're <a href="https://formcake.com/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">big fans</a> of, but you don't need to be a part of Stripe Atlas to sign up for Activate.</p>
<p>When signing up for Activate though you <em>do</em> need to know you'll be faced with a question that can drastically shape the number of credits you ultimately receive.</p>
<h2 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h2>
<p>When we first went through the process we very simply answered that question wrong. We encountered the following screen, outlining the different sign up paths for bootstrapped vs funded startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/aws-activate-screen.png" alt="AWS Activate bootstrapped vs funded startups"></p>
<p>When we first signed up, we did so as a bootstrapped startup: We're not accepting any funding, or even incorporating as a C Corp so we can have shares and an officer structure. We're incorporated as an LLC because we want to slowly build our way to profitability, so "bootstrapped" as a term seemed to described us.</p>
<p>We received $1,000 in AWS credits and were happy, but <a href="https://formcake.com/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">raised the issue with Stripe</a> that we were curious if there was a chance at getting the $5,000 that the Stripe copy seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>Stripe not only got back to us but fought for us to <a href="https://formcake.com/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits">receive the full $5,000 in credits from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>But in their email it became clear what the issue was: <strong>We signed up under the wrong option</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we're not accepting proper funding rounds, we are "sponsored" by Stripe in a sense through the Atlas program. That means we have an organization code/ID we can plug into the AWS Activate signup process signifying that we're a "funded" startup.</p>
<p>Doing so appears to net you a cool $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>Luckily we pestered Stripe to the point where we were able to receive not just the extra money ($5,000) but also keep the original, $1,000 amount. Since we're a small startup that's on an all-AWS infrastructure, this money was pretty critical to us, and provides a nice runway.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you're signing up for the AWS Activate program, consider looking for a program like Stripe Atlas to sign up with. If you're able to find this kind of sponsorship and sign up with your corresponding organization ID, you can probably expect more credits. Don't be like us and potentially leave this much money (well, credits) on the table.</p>
<p>If you're anything like us, that difference between $1,000 and $5,000 is something you can feel!</p>

Silica aerogels are light, porous foams that provide excellent thermal insulation.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, they are also known for their brittle behaviour, which is why they are usually reinforced with fibres or with organic or biopolymers for large-scale applications. Due to their brittle fracture behaviour, it is also not possible to saw or mill small pieces out of a larger aerogel block. Directly solidifying the gel in miniaturised moulds is also not reliably - which results in high scrap rates. This is why aerogels have hardly been usable for small-scale applications.</p><h2><b>Stable, well-formed microstructures</b></h2><p>The Empa team led by Shanyu Zhao, Gilberto Siqueira, Wim Malfait and Matthias Koebel have now succeeded in producing stable, well-shaped microstructures from silica aerogel by using a 3D printer. The printed structures can be as thin as a tenth of a millimeter. The thermal conductivity of the silica aerogel is just under 16 mW/(m*K) - only half that of polystyrene and even significantly less than that of a non-moving layer of air, 26 mW/(m*K). At the same time, the novel printed silica aerogel has even better mechanical properties and can even be drilled and milled. This opens up completely new possibilities for the post-processing of 3D printed aerogel mouldings.</p><p>With the method, for which a patent application has now been filed, it is possible to precisely adjust the flow and solidification properties of the silica ink from which the aerogel is later produced, so that both self-supporting structures and wafer-thin membranes can be printed. As an example of overhanging structures, the researchers printed leaves and blossoms of a lotus flower. The test object floats on the water surface due to the hydrophobic properties and low density of the silica aerogel - just like its natural model. The new technology also makes it possible for the first time to print complex 3D multi-material microstructures.</p><h2><b>Insulation materials for microtechnology and medicine</b></h2><p>With such structures it is now comparatively trivial to thermally insulate even the smallest electronic components from each other. The researchers were able to demonstrate the thermal shielding of a temperature-sensitive component and the thermal management of a local “hot spot” in an impressive way. Another possible application is the shielding of heat sources inside medical implants, which should not exceed a surface temperature of 37 degrees in order to protect body tissue.</p><h2><b>A functional aerogel membrane</b></h2><p>3D printing allows multilayer/multi-material combinations to be produced much more reliably and reproducibly. Novel aerogel fine structures become feasible and open up new technical solutions, as a second application example shows: Using a printed aerogel membrane, the researchers constructed a “thermos-molecular” gas pump. This permeation pump manages without any moving parts at all and is also known to the technical community as a Knudsen pump, named after the Danish physicist Martin Knudsen. The principle of operation is based on the restricted gas transport in a network of nanoscale pores or one-dimensional channels of which the walls are hot at one end and cold at the other. The team built such a pump from aerogel, which was doped on one side with black manganese oxide nanoparticles. When this pump is placed under a light source, it becomes warm on the dark side and starts to pump gases or solvent vapours.</p><h2><b>Air purification without moving parts</b></h2><p>These applications show the possibilities of 3D printing in an impressive way: 3D printing turns the high-performance material aerogel into a construction material for functional membranes that can be quickly modified to suit a wide range of applications. The Knudsen pump, which is driven solely by sunlight, can do more than just pump: If the air is contaminated with a pollutant or an environmental toxin such as the solvent toluene, the air can circulate through the membrane several times and the pollutant is chemically broken down by a reaction catalyzed by the manganese oxide nanoparticles. Such sun-powered, autocatalytic solutions are particularly appealing in the field of air analysis and purification on a very small scale because of their simplicity and durability.</p><p>Empa researchers are now looking for industrial partners who want to integrate 3D-printed aerogel structures into new high-tech applications.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;To demonstrate that fine aerogel structures can be produced in 3D printing, the researchers printed a lotus flower made of aerogel.
