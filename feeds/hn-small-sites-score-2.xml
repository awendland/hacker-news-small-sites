        <p>Published on: 2020-10-04</p>
        
<p>Dual licensing with GPL is the idea that if I own a certain piece of GPL code, I can also relicense it as a proprietary library. This is how Oracle licenses Java and how QT licenses QT.</p>
<h2>I - All rights for me but not for thee</h2>
<p>But my general feeling is that there is some stigma associated with this practice, to quote <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ReleaseUnderGPLAndNF">gnu.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To release a nonfree program is always ethically tainted, but legally there is no obstacle to your doing this. If you are the copyright holder for the code, you can release it under various different non-exclusive licenses at various times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "ethically tainted" doesn't resonate with me, I think this licensing model should be encouraged.</p>
<p>I will admit I am kind of biased on this because I work on a for-profit GPL-license project. But it strikes me as silly that this business model is shunned by the open-source community in favor of licensing under MIT/BSD.</p>
<p>Dual licensing is a way in which the "owner" of the code ends up in an advantageous position compared to other users.</p>
<p>That is to say, a user must abide by the strict rules of the GPL license:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release all modifications.</li>
<li>Potentially (depending on the specifics of the GPL license) have to release other projects that are used "in relation" to the library.</li>
<li>Not ship the code under a different license.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "owner" of the code abides by none of these and can thus benefit in ways that the users can't.</p>
<p>In the open-source utopia, where resources are aplenty for everyone, everything is open source and nothing is for sale, so dual-licensing doesn't fit that particular utopia. But we live in the real world, where money makes things a bit more complicated, and in the long term, dual-licensing might be better than equal-rights open licenses.</p>
<p>Well, developers have to eat.</p>
<p>Even worst, good software is made by good developers, developers which can get six-figure salaries designing skinner boxes. On the contingency that those developers aren't ideal altruists, they have to get way-above-subsistence salaries to work on useful open source projects instead of skinner boxes.</p>
<p>So if dual-licensing provides a middle ground for that which is better than the current situation where a lot of good software is proprietary, what's the harm?</p>
<p>Some would say it's a middle ground that will hamper the development of truly free software. But who release said truly free software anyway?</p>
<h2>II - Who release fully-free projects</h2>
<p>When it comes to license like MIT and BSD, that impose no restrictions upon usage, where the "owner" doesn't exist, it's interesting to look at who release projects under those licenses:</p>
<p>a) Students or hobbyists, people creating software for fun, notoriety, and experience.</p>
<p>b) Very large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber) or government &amp; donation founded organizations (Universities, Public Research centers, software foundations such as GNU, Apache, and LSF)</p>
<p>The first group is one I don't wish to dismiss, I think a lot of important programs stem from here. But their end goal is not to work for free for their whole life. Usually, they moonlight for their open-source projects and work a paid gig to earn money. A small minority can be funded by donations, but it's a small minority.</p>
<p>The project I use for allowing comments on this website (<a href="https://github.com/umputun/remark42">remark42</a>), has 2.3k stars on GitHub and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/remark42/posts">earns 9$/month from donations</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb">project I work on</a> has 2.9k stars on Github and an operating budget of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/16/mindsdb-raises-3-million-for-open-source-automated-machine-learning/">a few million</a> dollars.</p>
<p>You can certainly get to a point where you are funded by donations, but the reality is that it's not a good enough incentive. Doubly so since the developers working on these projects are usually the "creme de la creme", releasing and maintaining truly useful software usually requires expertise only a small fraction of engineers have.</p>
<p>The second group, the corporation and government-funded teams can only exist because of the scale.</p>
<p>Why can Facebook develop PyTorch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Facebook hires so many ML engineers that in the cost-benefit analysis it's cheaper to have your internal framework be popular enough such that you can get already-trained people from day 1. The &lt; 100 people working full time on PyTorch save months of training for every single one of the thousands of ML people facebook hires, since it can hire people that already know PyTorch.</li>
<li>Because Facebook doesn't dominate by having better ML models, it dominates by having thousands of times more data than anyone else. It's in facebook's interest to keep research open since it's objective is not to get ahead, but just to stay even, or at least not fall significantly behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Nvidia assign engineers to dozens of open source ML and game-engine projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Nvidia makes hundreds of billions each year selling GPUs. The little work they put into those libraries to make sure it works ideally with their GPUs is insignificant to the revenue they get from those markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Google develop TensorFlow?</p>
<ul>
<li>For about the same reasons as Facebook.</li>
<li>Because they can make a lot more money from selling/renting TensorFlow optimized hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's on the happier side of the spectrum. On the "shadier" end of the scale, one could argue projects like Flutter and Angular might be worth their investment because they make spyware-free browsers like Firefox send-class citizens in the war for the web, not to mention easier integration into internet-monopolizing schemas like AMP.</p>
<p>You've also got, I will admit, projects that seem to be open source purely for flexing. To my knowledge, Yandex might have well never released Clickhouse and the column-store database landscape would have been set back 10+ years for it. Why did they do it? Maybe just because few dozens of people working on it wanted to showcase how good they are.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, this is not a reliable model</p>
<h2>III - Profit motives</h2>
<p>So would it not be nice for open source if one can bring profit motives into the whole thing?</p>
<p>Even better, profit from the people that don't support or contribute to open source, but not from those that do.</p>
<p>It seems to me like double-licensing with GPL achieves just that. One can release a project and charge large companies for using it, at the risk of breaking the license if they don't pay. Even if a lot of them will use the software illegally, as is the case now, the threat of lawsuits will end up deterring some or most heavy-users from doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people using the project in an open-source project of their own have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The only problem that remains here is the fact that you can't chain GPL projects. That is to say, one can't use GPL code in their own double-licensed GPL code, but there are workarounds for that (e.g. isolating the GPL dependency and open-sourcing the changes to that alone). Still, this seems like the kind of problem that could be fixed by an off-shoot of the GPL meant for just this use-case.</p>
<p>This model keeps all the advantages of GPL, in that it incentives your users to open-source their product. It doesn't force them to do so, like a purely-GPL licensed software might, but it's not like GPL is working as intended, outside of a few cases where enough money was at stake to sue (e.g. TiVo), violations of the GPL go unpunished.</p>
<p>Currently, a company that wants to include GPL into their project has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the code in such a way that GPL won't force you to open source the rest of your code.</li>
<li>Use the code and break the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the wording of GPL is not that clear, it could often be argued that companies go for alternative nr 2. After all, who will ever know?</p>
<p>But what if the "pay the maintainer a small sum" option was available. Wouldn't the liability afraid giants look towards this much more favorably than either of the other 2 options? Wouldn't this, in the long run, give an edge to open source projects which don't have to worry about these fees ?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus I think I come in squarely on the side of open-source companies dual-licensing GPL on their product[s]. A model that already exists and often enough has great success (see MariaDB and Aerospike).</p>
<p>It's a nice compromise for moving towards a more open world, without having to live in Stallman's utopia. It's an amazingly pragmatic solution and anyone who reads this blog knows I'm a fan of those.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2020-10-03T09:00:00+0200">Sat, Oct 3, 2020</time></p>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Please feel free to reach out, ping me on twitter, or shoot me an email: I'm of course happy to share more thoughts if you have any question. And if you disagree with something, bring it on!

<br>
<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome is something that I have been battling with my entire life. Often times I get the feeling that whatever success &nbsp;I have acquired over the years might have just been luck or maybe things worked out because I partnered with the right people who did all the work while I reaped the fruits. </p><p>This feeling started all the way back in school when I scored the highest marks in an exam which everybody else struggled with. </p><p>At the time I was convinced that the only reason this happened was because I was lucky enough to have studied that one question in the syllabus which nobody thought would appear in the exam but ended up appearing. </p><p>But here’s the thing, because I felt like a fraud I ended up studying harder for the next exam with the fear of being exposed as someone who just got lucky in the last one. So is this feeling really a bad thing?</p><h3>‍<br>‍<strong>Why does imposter syndrome occur?</strong><br></h3><p>From my personal experience, I can say that imposter syndrome mainly occurs in people who have self taught themselves the skill that they are currently using to make a living. </p><p>In my case it is software development. I was not particularly good at it in college even though I was studying computer science. I was just an average student if not below average.</p><p>After I left college I started working in early stage startups where there is no structure or someone to teach you stuff. The only option is to do your own research and learn things yourself. Google and Stack overflow were my only true friends.</p><p>Because I never really went through a “standard program” I always have this self doubt and I never know if the way I am doing things is the right way or not and the fact that there is no defined right way of doing things in software does not make this any easier.<br></p><h3><strong>How do you use this as a strength</strong><br></h3><p>My co-founder and I built a business that <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/grow-shopify-micro-saas-to-25k-mrr-in-14-months" target="_blank">we grew to $25k MRR</a>. Because of my imposter syndrome I have convinced myself that most of it was luck. We were in the right place at the right time. <br></p><p>The fact that we did 2 months of research on the market and product, spent a lot of time figuring out where we would get distribution from even before writing a single line of code seemed to have conveniently slipped my mind. The reason we even did all of this in the first place was our fear of not being good enough.<br></p><p>We have now started a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">new venture</a> and hired a team. Now because of the fact that we had a successful venture in the past, I am now under immense pressure to make this new one a success otherwise I might get exposed as a “fraud” or someone who “just got lucky”. <br></p><p>Because I have no other option but to make this a success I am going to work hard once again just like I did in my last venture. I would like to think that this imposter syndrome has turned into a strength. It is a feature and not a bug.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>Some amount of self doubt is healthy and it keeps you on your toes. It also prevents you from letting your previous success go to your head and always be open for new learnings.<br></p><p>It enables you to be open to the suggestions given by your teammates which you might otherwise ignore just because they are less experienced than you if you had no self doubt at all. <br></p><p>Having said that, it is also not right to doubt yourself to an extent where it starts impacting you in a negative way. For instance, what if your teammates catch wind of your immense self doubt and they start losing faith in you? This is also not something you can afford.<br></p><p>One must have a healthy balance of self doubt and faith in yourself that you are moving in the right direction.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As the reading time estimate crept over 30 minutes, without any end in sight, I was starting to feel like a bit of a blowhard.</p>



<p>The draft I’d originally intended to inaugurate this blog is still sitting there. Maybe I will condense and finish it (eventually), but I think it makes more sense to write <s>briefly</s> less long-windedly about what I mean. Instead of trying to exhaust the subject matter, I’m going to offer a perspective, and present a more intuitive argument for it.</p>



<p>So, more briefly, I’d like to ask you to think, for a moment, about what makes humans <em>ethically</em> important. There are two parts to this question, hidden just under the surface. The first asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>agents</em>. What makes it possible for them to do, want, or experience things that could fall under the umbrella of ethics? The second (no particular order) asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>patients</em>. How is it that what happens to them, what is wanted of them, or what is experienced about them might also be part of an ethical problem? (This agent/patient distinction I inherit from Coeckelbergh, whose book, <em>Growing Moral Relations</em>, is worth your time.)</p>



<p>I will add before you start: ethics has been defined in a few different ways, over the millennia. I consider a few definitions interesting. </p>



<p>Charles Taylor, for instance, describes ethics as pertaining not just to moral choices and obligations between people, but questions like “what is the good life?” and “what is good?”. His more expansive account, following Aristotle, moves closer to the Greek root, which refers to one’s <em>character</em>, and can be read to have a slant towards something resembling <em>virtue ethics</em>. Using Taylor, we could ask questions like “what is it good to love?” and not just “what is the right way to act?” </p>



<p>Conversely, followers of Nietzsche contrast <em>ethics</em> with <em>morality</em>, arguing that morality is about passing judgment on what people (or living beings) are and do, whereas ethics can be about <em>affirming</em> life as intrinsically self-justifying. From a (post-) Nietzschean point of view, life’s capacity to want, struggle, and change, <em>is, from the very beginning, what is good</em> (maybe not in those words). Living well means trying to overcome the need to judge, and instead to explore and express what it is to be alive, for all its intensities and tragedies. Nietzsche is often read to be asking his readers to abandon compassion, or to think only of themselves and never of the common good, but I don’t think that is exactly the case. Nietzsche is asking us to live in pursuit of what is good, but not to define it as the enemy of the bad, rather, to live <em>for its own sake, come what may</em>, and to do what is good, <em>defined in itself</em>, rather than as a reaction.</p>



<p>I don’t know Coeckelbergh’s position on ethics broadly, but he considers morality to be embedded in social relationships themselves. Rather than what is right or wrong to do to a <em>patient</em> being about its properties (whether it has consciousness, for instance) and defined in absolute terms, morality is about what relationships exist between an agent and a patient, and what kinds of relationships are good to have, knowing what the agent and patient already are to each other. Do I already mostly act like it’s a person? I should probably treat it like one. Coeckelbergh is interesting in that he tries to legitimate ideas that have, until recently, not had much hearing in the community of western philosophers, although citing him as a source for them over others might, fairly, be challenged. For instance, he would consider our dependence on our ecology grounds to entertain an obligation towards it. I haven’t finished his book yet, so I’m not aware of the extent of the advice he gives for considering problems in these relationships, but it seems fair to say that he doesn’t believe there’s a system of absolute rules out there, or that we should try to find final answers to ethical problems. Relationships are particular, and they evolve. We shouldn’t seek to use the fact that we don’t get hard answers for our convenience; instead, we should consider relationships, for their lumpiness, their particularity, their uncertainty, and live them as best we can.</p>



<p>All of these viewpoints are very different from our ordinary patterns of ethical thought. We are used to thinking that <em>individuals</em>, or sometimes <em>social groups</em> (such as nations) have <em>rights</em> that must be guaranteed to them, but everything else goes. Sometimes, referencing Isaiah Berlin, we might say we believe that this obligation is <em>negative</em> (there are some things that people are fundamentally allowed to do, and our only obligation is to stop people who try to mess with that), or it is <em>positive</em> (there are some things that people should fundamentally be allowed to do, and we need to do our best to make that possible for them). Maybe, for whatever definition of the good, we are utilitarians, who think that we should do the most good for the most people, whatever means that could entail. Perhaps we take the <em>view from afar</em>, and ask “if I had the choice of all reasonably possible societies, which would I like to be born into, knowing that I might be anyone?” Perhaps we see ethics as different versions of the trolley problem, and find reasons, based on our moral intuitions, about what choices we should make when push comes to shove. Some of us, unfashionably, believe in immortal souls and divine law, against which we must not sin, or that her majesty inherits the right to judge from God, and that the highest good is obedience to an Earthly law. A scientist, being familiar with Hume, might read his argument that we cannot derive statements about what <em>ought to be</em> from statements about what <em>is</em>, and see cause to be an anti-realist. Maybe <em>ought</em> statements only express our personal preferences, derived from what we’ve been either (or both) biologically or socially conditioned to think is pleasing. Scientists might say this implies some sort of <em>relativism</em>, or that it’s best to follow whatever is the <em>conventional</em> way to think about ethics (although, if we’re not in the business of assuming the world is already a pretty just place to be in, that last one may not be safe). </p>



<p>So, knowing what you know about what humans are made of, and how they relate to one another, to society, or to other beings, what makes them ethical agents, and what does it mean that they are? What about patients? I think it’s probably a bad idea to try to find an answer too quickly. It might be better to think through what kinds of approaches are better, and what facts could be relevant to the question. For instance, maybe the way people want things matters, as it is defined in terms of elaborations on what’s generated by the default mode network. Maybe there can’t be exactly one right answer, or maybe there must be, or maybe it’s impossible to know. How would you argue that?</p>



<h2>Why it Matters </h2>



<p>I don’t fully agree with Taylor, but, in <em>Sources of the Self</em>, he makes a good case for why we shouldn’t be self-serving, and why we already care about ethics. He says ethics are about what we <em>want to be</em>, how we identify ourselves. This is always done in terms of social groups we identify <em>with</em>. “I am a professional, so I should…” Identity gives us community, people who share something about us (a way of life, perhaps), or maybe it contrasts us against a community (we can identify ourselves as rebels). We rarely, if ever, identify with just one thing, and it’s no use to try to come up with a completely original identity, if it’s possible to do it meaningfully at all, because it doesn’t tell us much about what we’re trying to be, given we’re the only one who would know or care that we’re being it. Identity is critically important to us in interpreting our place in the world, and what we are trying to do with it. So, says he, without identity, we would struggle to come to grips with life. It is a good thing, then, that you and I already have some ideas about <em>who we are</em>, or if we’re struggling to figure that out, generally already acknowledge that it <em>is</em> an important thing to get down. Taylor says that, since it’s all about coming to grips with life, we escape Hume’s is/ought problem, because we don’t have to set up an ethics from scratch. Ethics are already there from the beginning, and have some known properties, so we can argue about them by contrasting them. “Given these two frameworks, which one of them provides the richer set of tools for figuring out how to live a good life?” To Taylor, ethics are certainly <em>real</em>, but not in the sense that they’re an object embedded in a reality perfectly detached from us, rather, they come <em>from</em> the fact that we are social creatures, and relate <em>to</em> how we are trying to live in society. They aren’t just individual, or perfectly culturally relative (as there are no perfectly incommensurable cultures, which share none of the same moral ideas and cannot communicate with each other), but they aren’t exactly objective and final either.</p>



<p>I like Taylor, for how he grounds consciousness of <em>ethics</em> in <em>social consciousness</em>, and I like how good he is at striking down the (usually unanswerable) “why should I care about ethics?” question. I share Coeckelbergh’s complaint that he considers only one kind of relation (between the individual and the community), and I would also gripe that his ethics are unusually centred on the <em>self</em>, for a subject that tends to ask us to think beyond ourselves. But then, that is why the argument against selfishness works so well. It’s difficult to get through to somebody who only thinks of themself unless that’s the place you’re starting from. </p>



<p>Taylor’s other issues, which I will not go too in-depth on here, are first, that he frames the source of ethics as appearing in the fact that one is an <em>ind…</em></p></div></section></main></div></div>

<h2>What’s wrong with Disqus</h2>
<p>Disqus loads absurd amount of tracking services, which exposes your visitors’
personal data and significantly increases loading time. See, e.g., 
<a href="http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#what-s-wrong-with-disqus">this post</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s not covered here</h2>
<p>For a static website, one usually wants a lightweight commenting server with
as little dependencies as possible. Few commenting engines listed on the page
are provided by heavy applications (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">discourse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/debiki/talkyard">talkyard</a>), but the majority are
relatively lightweight applications designed specifically to provide 
comments for the static pages.</p>
<p>This page prioritizes information on self-hosted comments. However, there
are other open-source solutions, including implementations of third-party
services (e.g., Github issues, such as
<a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk">[2]</a>,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, or Wasm, is an open standard that allows developers to build apps that run inside a web browser using compiled programming languages. With WebAssembly, it’s possible to write components of web apps in languages such as C/C++, Rust, C#, and Go, among others, which run within the same sandbox as JavaScript. This allows things like porting existing libraries, leveraging capabilities not available in JavaScript, and running code faster because WebAssembly is compiled into a binary format.</p><p>Recently, I’ve been experimenting with WebAssembly to be able to run some Go code in the browser. Specifically, I’ve been trying to port certain parts of <a href="https://github.com/italypaleale/prvt">prvt</a>, an open source project for storing end-to-end encrypted documents, to run within a web browser directly. The reason for the WebAssembly experiment was two-fold: first, prvt makes extensive uses of cryptography and streams, both things which are not yet great in JavaScript; second, prvt itself is written in Go, so being able to re-use code in the browser would significantly simplify development.</p><blockquote><p>For an <strong>introduction to using WebAssembly with Go</strong>, I recommend <a href="https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/">this article on Golang Bot</a>.<br>Additionally, more information can be found in the Go project’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly">GitHub wiki</a> and in the documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/">syscall/js</a> package.<br>Note that as of writing, <strong>WebAssembly support in Go is still experimental</strong>. Because of that, the APIs might change too. This article was tested against Go 1.15.</p></blockquote><p>This article contains four different yet connected things that I’ve learnt while working on the WebAssembly port, and which I thought useful to share.</p><ol><li>Working with and creating JavaScript objects from Go code</li><li>Creating Promises in Go for passing async results</li><li>Making HTTP requests from Go code</li><li>Streaming from Go code</li></ol><h2 id="javascript-objects-in-webassembly-and-go">JavaScript objects in WebAssembly and Go</h2><p>The WebAssembly runtime for Go automatically converts the most common Go types to their JavaScript equivalent. The documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#ValueOf">js.ValueOf</a> method contains a nice summary table of how Go and JavaScript types are matched:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">| Go                     | JavaScript             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| js.Value               | [its value]            |
| js.Func                | function               |
| nil                    | null                   |
| bool                   | boolean                |
| integers and floats    | number                 |
| string                 | string                 |
| []interface{}          | new array              |
| map[string]interface{} | new object             |
</code></pre></div><p>From here, you can see that the most common types, such as numbers, booleans, and strings, are converted automatically. The last row is particularly interesting as it explains how to pass “Plain Old JavaScript Objects” (POJO’s), which are the simplest kinds of objects (also called dictionaries).</p><p>For example, the following Go code defines a function called <code>MyGoFunc</code> that can be called from JavaScript code, which returns a dictionary with a string and a number (as you can see, types can be heterogeneous).</p><blockquote><p>For instructions of how to compile Go code into WebAssembly, check out the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started">Getting Started section</a> of the Wiki.</p></blockquote><p>After having compiled the code into WebAssembly and having imported it in the JavaScript code, you can call <code>MyGoFunc()</code> from JavaScript to see the result. For example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>MyGoFunc</span><span>())</span>
<span>// Prints: {hello: "world", answer: 42}
</span></code></pre></div><p>However, what the documentation is less explicit about is that we can also <strong>use any JavaScript object</strong> inside the Go code, <strong>even built-ins</strong>! And this is where things can start getting more interesting.</p><p>For example, let’s try to pass a date as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> object. To do that, we first need to grab the <code>Date</code> constructor, loading its <code>js.Value</code> from the global scope of JS:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span> <span>:=</span> <span>js</span><span>.</span><span>Global</span><span>().</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"Date"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we can create a new object off this constructor with the <code>dateConstructor.New</code> method, passing any argument to it as you’d pass to the <code>new Date()</code> constructor in JavaScript. The result of the invocation is a <code>js.Value</code> that can be returned to JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(</span><span>"2020-10-01"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, we can modify our <code>MyGoFunc</code> to return the current date as computed in Go:</p><p>Invoking <code>MyGoFunc()</code> in the JavaScript code will now return a <code>Date</code> object:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyGoFunc</span><span>()</span>

Instead, the documentation recommends that all blocking calls be inside a goroutine, which raises the problem of then returning the value to the JavaScript code. Quoting from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#FuncOf">docs</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Invoking the wrapped Go function from JavaScript will pause the event loop and spawn a new goroutine. Other wrapped functions which are triggered during a call from Go to JavaScript get executed on the same goroutine.<br>As a consequence, if one wrapped function blocks, JavaScript’s event loop is blocked until that function returns. Hence, calling any async JavaScript API, which requires the event loop, like fetch (http.Client), will cause an immediate deadlock. Therefore a blocking function should explicitly start a new goroutine.</p></blockquote><p>Using a Promise is perhaps the best way to solve this problem: avoiding deadlocks while allowing programming with idiomatic JavaScript.</p><p>We saw in the previous section that we can create custom JavaScript objects from Go, and this applies to Promises too! We just need to create the <code>Promise</code> object by passing a function to the constructor. Just like in the pure-JS code above, this function receives two arguments, which are functions themselves: <code>resolve</code> should be invoked with the final result when the Promise’s work is done, and <code>reject</code> can be called when there’s an error to make the Promise fail.</p><p>Here’s an updated <code>MyGoFunc</code> that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/yoursay/tongue_twisters/italian/trotting_trentonians.shtml">another Italian tongue twister!</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><p>To invoke this from JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p><span lang="FR">Radix Sort Revisited<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="EN-GB">Pierre <span>Terdiman</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Last revision: 04.01.2000<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">In every decent
programmer’s toolbox lies a strange weapon called a Radix Sort. Where does it
come from&nbsp;? Who invented it&nbsp;? I don’t know. As far as I can remember
it was there, fast, easy, effective. <i>Really</i> effective. So unbelievably
useful I’ve never really understood why people would want to use something
else. The reasons&nbsp;? Most of the time, they tell me about floats, negative
values, and why their new quick-sort code rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Enough, I’m tired.
Although the standard Radix Sort doesn’t work very well with floating point
values, this is something actually very easy to fix. In this little article I
will review the standard Radix Sort algorithm, and enhance it so that&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it sorts
negative floats as well<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it has
reduced complexity for bytes and words<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it uses
temporal coherence<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it
supports sorting on multiple keys<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">Is it worth writing
anything in 2000 about a sort routine&nbsp;? Doesn’t everyone already have
one&nbsp;? Aren’t those things already well known&nbsp;? Everyone knows how to
sort negative floats with a Radix, don’t you think&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Well, that’s what I
would’ve said some weeks ago. But I recently wandered on Ming C. Lin’s homepage
[2], and began to read her courses. Here’s what I found&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Counting sort
and radix sort are good for integers. For floating point numbers, try bucket
sort or other comparison-based methods&nbsp;» (21 sept. 1999) [3]<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">As you see this is
not very old…I read more of the courses, read some older papers about collision
detection, and it appeared my own way of dealing with a specific part of this
problem was (at least from a theoretical point of view) faster than the
official one. Hence, I think this article will be useful for beginners as well
as for experienced programmers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">A Radix Sort is an
apparently bizarre sort routine which manages to sort values without actually
performing any comparisons on input data. That’s why this sort routine breaks
the theoretical lower bound of the O(N*logN) complexity, which only applies for
comparison-based sorts. Radix is O(k*N), with k = 4 most of the time, and
although this is not an in-place sort (i.e. it uses extra storage) it is so
much faster than any other sorting methods it has become a very popular way of sorting
data.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">The algorithm<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">What is a <i>radix</i>, anyway&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Roughly we can say a radix is a position in a number. In the decimal
system, a radix is just a digit in a decimal number. For example the number
«&nbsp;42&nbsp;» has two digits, or two radices, which are 4 and 2. In
hexadecimal the radix is 8 bits wide. For example the hexadecimal number 0xAB
has two radices, A and B. The Radix Sort gets its name from those radices,
because the method first sorts the input values according to their first radix,
then according to the second one, and so on. The Radix Sort is then a multipass
sort, and the number of passes equals the number of radices in the input
values. For example you’ll need 4 passes to sort standard 32 bits integers,
since in hexadecimal the radix is a byte. By the way that’s why the Radix Sort
is often called <i>Byte Sort</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">How does it work&nbsp;? Say you want to sort some bytes, for
example&nbsp;those ones:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">54,
18, 2, 128, 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The idea behind the Radix Sort is to read input values and immediately
store them at the right place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Have a look at that sample code&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char InputValues[] = { 54, 18, 2, 128, 3 };<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int SortedBuffer[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(SortedBuffer, -1, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Fill with –1<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(int i=0&nbsp;;i&lt;5&nbsp;;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>SortedBuffer[c] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Now you can read SortedBuffer and get
values back in sorted order<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">You may think this example is stupid – it <i>is</i>&nbsp;! – but it
nicely introduces the ideas we’ll have to deal with. What do we need to change
in that code, in order for it to become useful&nbsp;? First we need to get rid
of the empty destination locations, so that the destination buffer (called
SortedBuffer in our example) has the same size as the input buffer (i.e. enough
for 5 values, no more). We also need a way to handle collisions – collisions in
the hash-table sense of the word, i.e. we must be able to deal with two equal
input values and know how to store both of them in the final buffer. Luckily
enough, both problems are solved by the same solution&nbsp;: an <i>offset table</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The offset table is a 256-entries table telling us, for each possible
input byte, where we should store the result. It is usually built in two
passes, one to compute the distribution of bytes in the input flow (i.e.
histograms, or <i>counters</i>), another one to create the offset table
according to this distribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This sample code&nbsp;creates the counters:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int
Counters[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(Counters, 0, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp; </span>//
Set all counters to 0<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(
i =0&nbsp;; i &lt; NbItems&nbsp;; i++){<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
Loop over the input array<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<span> </span>//
Get current byte…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Counters[c]++;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
…and update counter<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">We can now create the offset table&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int OffsetTable[256];<o:p></o:p></span></pre><pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[0] = 0;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(i=1;i&lt;256;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[i] = OffsetTable[i-1] +
Counters[i-1];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Now, for each input byte, we can
get the right offset back thanks to this table, put the input byte at the right
place in the destination buffer, increase the offset, and repeat the sequence
for the next byte.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">For example&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>unsigned char c =
InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DestinationBuffer[OffsetTable[c]++] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The destination buffer won’t have
any empty locations&nbsp;: we have enough room in it for the same number of
values as in the input buffer, no more. Thanks to the offsets we know exactly
where we must store them, and whenever an empty location would have existed in
our first example, here it doesn’t appear because no offset actually maps that
empty location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Collisions are not a problem
either because offsets are increased each time we use one of them. If we have
two identical bytes in input, the first one will be put in
DestinationBuffer[Offset], Offset will be increased, and the next one will then
fall in DestinationBuffer[Offset+1]. Radix sort is <i>stable</i> by the way,
which means two same values in input will be in the same order in output.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This last point is very important
to understand the next step&nbsp;: how can we extend the process in order to
sort not only bytes but also words, dwords, or event character strings&nbsp;?
This is actually very simple&nbsp;: we just have to sort again according to the
next radix. Recall a radix actually is a byte in the values to sort. The first
radix is the LSB (Least Significant Byte). The last one must be the MSB (Most
Significant Byte). Between those two, we perform all necessary passes. The
second pass doesn’t destroy what has been done in the first one because the
sorting method is stable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Example&nbsp;: say we want to sort
those hexadecimal values&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xBC, 0xAB, 0xBA, 0xAC, 0xBB, 0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first pass leads to&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Note that the list is sorted
according to the last column (ie the LSB which is the first radix). The second
pass will sort this list according to the first column (ie the MSB, our second
radix) and since the sorting method is stable, the 3 numbers 0xAA, 0xAB and
0xAC which share the same MSB will be found in output in the same order as in
input. And since the input order has been determined by the first sorting pass,
eh, it’s already sorted according to the LSB, and here we are with the final
sorted list&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Radix selection is
performed by shifting and ANDing the input value according to the pass
number&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">unsigned
char Radix = (InputValues[i]&gt;&gt;(Pass&lt;&lt;3)) &amp; 0xFF;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">…where pass begins
to 0 and gets increased for each new pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>







<p><b><span lang="FR">Sorting floating point values<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Ok, that was the
standard Radix Sort, as most of us knew it on old 16 bits computers. What
happened then, was the following&nbsp;: one day, we all switched to 80486 (or
Pentium) and suddenly we had floats. At first sight, a Radix Sort can’t deal
with floats&nbsp;: the inner structure of a float isn’t obvious, you don’t
really see how to shift them or AND a value with them (the algorithm involves
such an operation, as seen just above), you don’t even know how to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first step is to
learn how a floating-point value is actually built. This is well known
nowadays&nbsp;: the first bit is the sign bit, the next 8 bits are the biased
exponent, and the 23 last ones are the mantissa. The exponent is always
positive thanks to the bias. Chris Hecker once wrote a good introduction paper
to the numerous floating-points tricks you can afford on Intel processors [1].
Let’s quote him&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Because the
exponent are always positive (and are in more significant bits than the
mantissa), large numbers compare greater than small numbers even when the
floating-point values are compared as normal integer bits. The sign bit throws
a monkey wrench in this, but it works great for single-signed values.&nbsp;»<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">I couldn’t have said
that better. And from this point, it is easy to see why it works with positive
floats. Let’s define a function IR(x) as the integer representation of any
floating-point value x. For example the floating-point value 42.0 has a binary
representation of 0x42280000. In other words&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">IR(42.0)
= 0x42280000<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The Radix Sort works
with positive floats because for any floating-point values x and y,<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">x
&gt; y &gt;0 =&gt; IR(x) &gt; IR(y)<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Hence x and y will
be treated by the sorting code as IR(x) and IR(y), and the final order will be
correct. This is easy to check&nbsp;: just cast your float pointer into integer
pointer and ask your code to sort your array of positive floats&nbsp;! It
works. Well, it doesn’t work on DEC Alpha because the float format is
different, but that’s another story&nbsp;: it works provided you use IEEE
floats, which means it works on PC, on Dreamcast, and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><u>Basic Explanation</u> <p> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/157970785" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></h2>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a framework which is designed to provide time management recipes and hence improving your focus and productivity.</p>
<h2><u>Process</u></h2>
<p>Firstly, Find and list down tasks to be done. The follow steps given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a task from list.</li>
<li>Focus for next 25 mins. Work closely with little or zero distractions and no pause. Pomodoro teaches to manage distractions. List down if any distractions identified in this step.</li>
<li>Take a 5 min break. Once 25 minutes ended, relax, clear your mind and come back after 5 mins.</li>
<li>Repeat it for 4 times.</li>
<li>Total time spent is 2 hours. 1 hours 40 mins for work and 20 mins break. Note progress that you have made.</li>
<li>After 4th iteration, take a long break of 15 - 25 mins and come back to restart from point 1.</li>
<li>Long break can be used for lunch in between.</li>
</ul>

<p>25-minute blocks are called <strong>Pomodoro sessions</strong> and it’s the core of this Technique. Work is divided / breakdown into smaller sprints. Due to shorter sprints cycle, any tasks (small or big) becomes much more manageable and the brain is getting trained to focus and eventually it helps to make progress.</p>
<p>Generally, an 8-hour workday technically leaves room for sixteen Pomodoro sessions, but do keep some Pomodoro sessions in the buffer as a factor of safety. In case a task required more than available Pomodoro sessions, then tasks need a further breakdown. Tasks which takes less than one Pomodoro sessions can be combined with other tasks.</p>
<p>Pomodoro sessions are strictly delegated for work, learning, reading, improving skills. If a task is completed and have few minutes in hand during a session, utilise it carefully.</p>
<h2><u>Result</u></h2>
<p>With all the time available in a day, With the Pomodoro technique, you have a clear measurement of your time and efforts. It leads to reflect and plan your days more accurately and efficiently.</p>
<p>With time, a more accurate assessment of Pomodoro sessions will be developed and hence building consistent work habits.</p>
<h2><u>Pomodoro Timer App for Pomodoro Timer</u></h2>
<p><a href="https://pomofocus.io/">https://pomofocus.io/</a>. This tool helps you to focus and manager your tasks.</p>
<h2><u>Pomodoro Technique Playlist</u></h2>
<p>A playlist to utilise the Pomodoro technique. 4 cycles of 25 minutes of focus LoFi music followed by 5 minutes of vocal tracks for a break. Make sure shuffle is turned off. At the end of the playlist, take a 30-minute break.</p>

<article id="post-119">

<p>I was talking to my friend Josh a couple weeks ago about the speed at which teams move and how best managers can create a sense of urgency. We pretty quickly agreed that there are two types of urgency for a team: push-based and pull-based.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Is your urgency push-based or pull-based?</p><p>It's a thought-provoking management question.</p><p>Ex: Arbitrary deadline=push, Excitement=pull</p><p>Does this division make sense? What other kinds of urgency are there?</p></div>— Joshua Levy (@ojoshe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ojoshe/status/1309279621448310786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>I felt like this is an important delineation, and wanted to summarize our conversation a little, just by giving some examples.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Team:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>You hire people who will what is asked of them, and nothing more.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>You hire people who are conscientious and self-motivated, and if they aren’t being pushed, they will push themselves and everyone around them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Goals:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>The team has “soul-less” goals like “get X done by Y” or “increase metric Y by Z”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The team clearly understands the value of what they are building and are excited about making it real.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Road-blocks:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Team members constantly lose momentum because they run into obstacles that are beyond their control.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The “path is paved”, so-to-speak. Team members might face obstacles, but they are either empowered to clear those obstacles or have access to executives that can clear the obstacles for them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deadlines:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Arbitrary deadlines like “our exec wants this done by Friday”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based:</strong> Self-imposed deadlines like “this should take 2 weeks, and we will hold ourselves accountable to that”.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>We actually discussed deadlines a little bit, and as Josh always does he broke out a few dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>Deadlines can be artificial or real. An artificial deadline is one in which there will be no repercussions if the deadline is missed, and a real one has repercussions.</li><li>Deadlines can be superimposed or self-imposed. A team can decide a deadline for itself, or someone (typically more senior) can decide a deadline for them.</li><li>Deadlines can be evident or arbitrary. An evident deadline might be “if we don’t build our product by November, we’ll miss out on the holiday season orders.”</li></ul>



<p>So a deadline that is real, superimposed, and arbitrary, could be something like “If you don’t accomplish this by end-of-month, you will be fired.”</p>



<p>Someone once told me that managers push and leaders pull. Plenty of people, companies, and teams have gotten results with very “push-based” urgencies, but if you ask someone which type of urgency they prefer on their team, they’ll likely say “pull-based”. Which is an interesting point to ponder.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa238">A study which has just been published in the leading neurology journal Brain</a>,  indicates that Parkinson's disease is not one but two diseases, starting either in the brain or in the intestines.</p>

<p>These two groups of patients displayed strikingly different profiles on multimodal imaging battery.</p>

<p>These profiles support the existence of a brain-first and body-first subtype of Parkinson’s disease, and furthermore, that premotor rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is a highly predictive marker of the body-first subtype.
<img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2019/wheredoespar.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Neuropathological autopsy studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or incidental Lewy body disease have shown discrepant results.</p>

<p>Heiko Braak’s staging system was derived from a cohort of patients, who were selected based on the presence of Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and all these patients conformed to a brainstem predominant type.</p>

<p>Other studies reported that some post-mortem cases do not harbour Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and a minority of patients do not follow the Braak staging scheme.</p>

<p>A pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease is the presence of intraneuronal a-synuclein inclusions termed Lewy pathology. However, it remains unknown from where the initial a-synuclein aggregates originate.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that a-synuclein inclusions initially form in nerve terminals of the enteric nervous system, and then subsequently spread via autonomic connections to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and intermediolateral cell columns of the sympathetic system (Braak et al., 2003).</p>

<p>In addition, Lewy pathology has been detected in gastrointestinal nerve fibres years prior to Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.
There is also epidemiological evidence that complete but not partial vagotomy may protect against later Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>Autopsy studies have shown that a minority of cases with Lewy pathology do not have pathological inclusions in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and that a fraction of cases display a limbic-predominant distribution of a-synuclein inclusions with less pathology in the brainstem.</p>

<p>The scientists hypothesized that the appearance of isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder well before parkinsonism is a strong marker of the body-first subtype. The presence of REM sleep behaviour disorder in the premotor phase is a marker of the body-first type, probably a reflection of ascending a-synuclein pathology reaching the pons before the substantia nigra.

<p>To test this hypothesis, they recruited de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease and performed video-polysomnography to divide patients into de novo Parkinson’s disease without REM sleep behaviour disorder and de novo Parkinson’s disease with pre-motor REM sleep behaviour disorder. The study was conducted between August 2018 and January 2020.</p>

<p>The scientists have shown that prodromal and de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease can be categorized by means of multimodal imaging into distinct clusters, which are compatible with a brain-first and body-first Parkinson’s disease subtype.</p>

<p>Their conclusion is that the Parkinson’s disease comprises two subtypes: 
(i) a body-first (bottom-up) subtype, where the pathology originates in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system, and then ascends via the vagus nerve and sympathetic connectome to the CNS;</p>

<p>(ii) a brain-first (top-down) subtype, in which the a-synuclein pathology initially arises in the brain itself or sometimes enters via the ol- factory bulb, and subsequently descends to the peripheral autonomic nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Body-first (bottom-up) subtype:</strong>
The initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system. It then propagates via the sympathetic connectome to the heart, and via the vagus nerve to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

<em>The pons area in the brain.
Source Wikipedia</em></p>

<p>Ascending pathology affects pontine structures giving rise to REM sleep behaviour disorder before the substantia nigra shows substantial involvement.
When parkinsonism appears, signifying a loss of 450% of nigrostriatal dopamine terminals, all lower Braak stage structures show marked damage on relevant imaging markers.</p>

<p><strong>Brain-first (top-down) subtype:</strong>
 In the brain-first type, the initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the CNS.
The most likely site of origin seems to be the amygdala or connected structures, or the pathology may in some cases enter via the olfactory bulb.
Rarely, the pathology arises in the upper brainstem (substantia nigra or locus coeruleus).
The pathology spreads from the site of origin to the brainstem and cortex.
When parkinsonism appears, the brainstem shows a rostro-caudal gradient of pathology with marked involvement of the substantia nigra, moderate involvement of the neighbouring pons, but little involvement of the medulla and autonomic nervous system.</p>

        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed Version Control System (VCS). Git can
be hard, especially for people discovering it for the first time, but there are
a lot of things that make this an exceptional VCS worth learning. This post is
not meant to be a git tutorial, but rather a compilation of things and tips I
find interesting. I also wanted to give a perspective of git independent of
services like GitHub. Hopefully you can find something useful and “<em>git better
at it</em>” 🙃.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to learn how to use git, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/">Pro Git
book</a>, it’s free and it is a great resource!</p>

<h2 id="git-is-not-github-">Git is not GitHub 😮</h2>

<p>Services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> made git particularly popular, but
the convenience of something like Github has its downsides for new users: it
causes confusion about the differences between <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and the actual version control system, <em>git</em>.
While the former are great to host git repositories and make them publicly
available (among other things), git is a piece of software designed to allow for
distributed version control and collaboration. This means that you can use it
offline, without GitHub, you can collaborate with people via chat, email, and
anything that allows you to send text to someone else. Yes, GitHub makes it
convenient to host your project and make it discoverable; it provides an
incentive for collaboration, but, at the end of the day, GitHub is not git, just
as Gmail is not e-mail.</p>

<h2 id="git-is-distributed-">Git is distributed 🖧</h2>

<p>For those used to GitHub, collaborating with git over e-mail might seem
anachronistic, but, consider the scale of projects and what git was designed to
do. Being able to send contributions as plain text allied with the threaded
nature of e-mail, means that you can have multiple discussions around certain
aspects of a contribution, which is a big plus. Linux kernel development, for
example, doesn’t happen on GitHub or GitLab. From the linux kernel GitHub Pull
requests (GitHub’s system for submitting contributions):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel!</p>

  <p>Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub -
this GitHub repository is a read-only mirror that isn’t used for accepting
contributions. So that your change can become part of Linux, please email it
to us as a patch.</p>

  <p>Sending patches isn’t quite as simple as sending a pull request, but
fortunately it is a well documented process.</p>

  <p>Here’s what to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format your contribution according to kernel requirements</li>
    <li>Decide who to send your contribution to</li>
    <li>Set up your system to send your contribution as an email</li>
    <li>Send your contribution and wait for feedback</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The development happens on various mailing lists for multiple subsystems. It’s
distributed development to an unprecedented scale. This scale has a price,
discipline in your contributions, something that GitHub doesn’t really help
reinforce –which seems to be the whole
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674">issue</a> that the
creator of git Linus Torvalds has with it.</p>

<h3 id="git-daemon-">Git daemon 🌐</h3>

<p>Focusing the development on a centralised service like GitHub can feel like
you’re using an improved version of Subversion client/server approach, but
remember, git is truly a decentralized system and we can do better. Suppose you
don’t want to use GitHub, but want to make your repository available for other
people to clone, pull from, etc. Git supports Peer-to-Peer setup out of the box
with <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon"><code>git
daemon</code></a>.
Collaboration then happens on each peer local copy of the source tree and some
form of communication channel (e.g. e-mail, chat, etc).</p>

<p>From your git folder you can execute the following command</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git daemon <span>--export-all</span> <span>--base-path</span><span>=</span><span>.</span> <span>--reuseaddr</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>--enable=upload-pack</code>: (enabled by default) allows for <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and <code>git clone</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--export-all</code>: means that you don’t have to create a file named git-daemon-export-ok in each exported repository.</li>
  <li><code>--base-path</code>: allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire
path. Example: if you start the daemon with <code>--base-path=/srv/git</code> and try to
pull from <code>git://example.com/hello.git</code>, git daemon will interpret the path as
<code>/srv/git/hello.git</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--reuseaddr</code>: allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations, your machine is now running a git server and anyone can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone git://192.168.1.42/  <span>#Your IP</span>
<span># or</span>
git remote add Foo git://192.168.1.42/
git fetch Foo
git checkout develop
git push Foo develop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="git-patches-">Git patches 📝</h3>

<p>As we have discussed, git is a decentralized system, you can send contributions
to anyone without the need of a centralized git repository. This is not only the
default way of collaborating with git, it is particularly useful when a server
is down, or if you don’t have permissions to write to a remote repository
—but would still like to propose changes.</p>

<p>You can create a patch from your current changes without committing the code on
your source tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># changes in the working tree not yet staged for commit</span>
git diff <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
<span># or changes between the index and your last commit;</span>
<span># what you would be committing if you run "git commit"</span>
<span># without "-a" option.</span>
git diff <span>--cached</span> <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example suppose the change is the addition of a README file, the diff
would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>diff --git a/README b/README
</span><span>new file mode 100644
</span><span>index 0000000..e69de29
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>More often, what we would like to do is to propose a change we have made in your
local source tree. To do this, we can use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch"><code>git
format-patch</code></a> command:</p>



<p>if we have commits ahead of the master branch, a diff file will be generated. We can also reference other commits in the same branch.
Suppose we made changes in the current branch and want to reference the changes in relation to the last commit. We can do:</p>



<p>the patch file will contain something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>From daf1010eb425a67ca6b0ba60f7cbec15bcff31f1 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: John Doe &lt;heresjohnny@bestmail.com&gt;
Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2020 15:42:00 +0100
Subject: [PATCH] Update README
</span>
---
 README | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

diff --git a/README b/README
<span>index e69de29..d0fc019 100644
</span><span>--- a/README

</span><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span>
<span>+This is a README file, that is all.
</span><span>--
</span><span>2.28.0
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>to apply the patch we do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># patch as unstaged changes in your branch</span>
git apply 0001-Update-README.patch

<span># patch as commits</span>
git am 0001-Update-README.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<!-- 
### git request-pull ✉️

Git comes with its own [pull request
module](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull).

This feature has nothing to do with [GitHubs pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request).
It's mean to facilitate the creation of summary messages to be sent through
e-mail for example. If you want to use GitHubs pull request feature without the
web interface, check out the [hub](https://hub.github.com/) command line interface tool.
{: .notice--danger}

Imagine that you built your work on your master branch on top of the v1.0
release, and want it to be integrated to the project. First you push that change
to your public repository for others to see. If this is a remote repository you might do it like this:

```bash
git push https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

Then we run the following command:

```bash
git request-pull v1.0 https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

This will produce a request message with information about:

 1. where to pull from (your downstream repository address)
 2. the upstream repository
 3. a summary of the changes between v1.0 release and your master.

You can then send this request by e-mail for instance, making the pull request
completely distributed and independent from GitHub proprietary system.
-->

<h2 id="git-tips-">Git tips 🔥</h2>

<p>We are all bound to get stuck sometimes when things go wrong. A good starting
point is this <a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">compilation</a>. These are solutions to
problems I often have to solve.</p>

<h3 id="premature-commit-">Premature commit 🔧</h3>

<p>You pulled the trigger too fast on that commit and wish you could include
additional changes? Make your changes, call <code>git commit --amend</code> and done. (Also
useful to change the commit message.)</p>

<h3 id="go-back-">Go back ⌛</h3>

<p>We messed up, go back to a previous commit.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># go back n commits n=1 in this case,</span>
<span># --soft: optionally don't discard changes</span>
<span># and put them on the staging area instead</span>
git reset HEAD~1 <span>--soft</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="put-changes-on-hold-">Put changes on hold 🚧</h3>

<p>So you want to get back to the state before you started making changes, but
don’t want to throw these changes away:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># stash the changes</span>
git stash
<span># get the changes back when needed</span>
git stash pop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="where-it-went-wrong-">Where it went wrong 🔍</h3>

<p>You have a problem and don’t know which commit introduced it, enter <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect"><code>git bisect</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git bisect start          <span># start a bisect section</span>
git bisect bad            <span># Current version is bad</span>
git bisect good v2.2.1    <span># v2.2.1 is known to be good</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>bisect will now choose commits in the middle of the history and you can mark
them as good or bad with the same commands. When no more revisions are available
you’ll have a description of the commit that caused the problem. You can then reset
the bisect state with <code>git bisect reset</code>.</p>

<h3 id="rebasing-commits-">Rebasing commits 💥</h3>

<p>Sometimes we make two commits when in reality, we could have included all the
changes in a single commit, and our history would be clearer. This is what is
known as <em>squashing</em>. We can use <code>git rebase</code> to meld commits with previous
commits. It can also be used instead of merging branches. Git’s rebase command
temporarily rewinds the commits on your current branch, pulls in the commits
from the other reference and reapplies the re-winded commits back on top.</p>

<p>Most people will advise you to always squash the commits and rebase them onto
the parent branch (like master or develop) before you submit a pull request or
send out a patch. Whether rebasing is preferred to merging really depends on the
context.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about <code>rebase</code> vs <code>merge</code>, check out <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a">this
post</a></p>

<p>Whatever you do <strong>DO NOT</strong> rebase commits in a upstream repository people can
pull from. It will mess everyone’s history and lead to conflicts that all
downstream peers will need to fix.
Also, it’s <strong>never</strong> a good idea to <strong>rebase somebody else’s work</strong>, see <a href="https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_rebase.html">this
discussion</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># rebase last 2 commits</span>
git rebase <span>-i</span> HEAD~2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interactive system will open an editor where you can choose each commit in a
list that are about to be changed. In this case, it will list 2 lines with the
last 2 commits. This list reflects exactly how your branch will look like after
the rebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pick c8175df added line
pick dc58443 added final line

<span># Rebase 65e38e0..dc58443 onto 65e38e0 (2 commands)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Commands:</span>
<span># p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = meld into previous commit</span>
<span># f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard log message</span>
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can pick, reorder or squash any commits you want to make for a more readable
history.</p>

<p>As we discussed, you can also rebase the current branch onto another</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git checkout feature
git rebase <span>-i</span> master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information about rebase see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">documentation</a></p>

<h3 id="good-commit-messages-">Good commit messages 🧐</h3>

<p>Commit messages should be consistent across a project in terms of <strong>style</strong>,
<strong>content</strong>, and <strong>metadata</strong>. But some good rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the minimum is a single short …</li></ol></section></div>

October 3, 2020 | https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 1984 the co-inventor of Unix, Ken Thompson, delivered a seminal speech in which he highlighted that <em>you can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself</em> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. For a while, this lesson was largely ignored as open-source package registries like RubyGems, PyPI and npm grew rapidly. However, as we’re seeing <a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/mining-for-malicious-ruby-gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> supply-chain attacks through software dependencies, the risks of using unvetted dependencies are becoming clearer.</p>

<p>The risks are particularly great for JavaScript applications. Veracode found that the average JavaScript project relies on 377 dependencies – compared with just 16 for Python projects, or 43 in the Java ecosystem<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Whenever a developer pulls in a new dependency, they are implicitly trusting the maintainers of that dependency. Often, this trust is awarded on the basis of popularity – we assume that a popular library will be more carefully vetted, or that since many others trust the maintainers, we can too. Other times, this trust relationship and the risks involved are not considered at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some have argued</a> that the ill health of the npm registry is a social, rather than a technical problem, and suggest a human-compiled set of packages in order to separate the wheat of maintained, healthy packages from the chaff of abandoned toy projects with no documentation. <a href="https://medium.com/@dpc_96143/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse-b75d58398cb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another suggestion from the Rust world</a> involves creating a manual web of trust from maintainers cryptographically signing each other’s projects. Either way, there are challenges: webs of trust have rarely taken off (outside of Debian), and compiling a vetted set of packages from scratch is a massive undertaking. I propose something in the middle: bootstrapping a web of trust using existing npm dependency relationships, and building from that foundation.</p>

<h2 id="existing-trust-relationships-in-npm">Existing trust relationships in npm</h2>

<p>Creating a web of trust from existing npm dependencies is, admittedly, somewhat problematic. As stated earlier, choosing to use a particular dependency is not always a well-considered decision based on researching its code and maintainers, and the trust relationship is merely implied. Similarly, there is no cryptographic verification of this weak trust, nor does npm currently have the infrastructure for such tools<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. What I am suggesting is an imperfect starting point to demonstrate the need for, and potential of, stronger trust measures in open source.</p>

<p>To construct this initial web, we can model npm’s maintainerships as a graph. If we let each node be a maintainer, then the edges between them are the trust relationship arising from using a dependency. In other words, if Alice maintains a package A, and A depends on package B maintained by Bob, then there is a directed edge from Alice to Bob. We can even weigh these edges by the number of Alice’s packages in which she implies trust of Bob.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-graph">Exploring the graph</h2>

<p>This simple model exhibits a power-law-like pattern in terms of trust: the vast majority of users are trusted by few or no others, and a very small number of users are highly trusted. This type of pattern is common in social networks: you see a similar thing emerge when plotting follower counts on Twitter. Such power laws often lead to a rich-get-richer feedback process in which the inequality (in terms of trust, in this case) gets more pronounced over time<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/efe1a929e64ebeeb021e79f341b35faa4baf1397/c0643/static/img/maintainer-wot-in-degrees.png" alt="Scatter plot of in-degree vs. number of users. Shows a roughly power-law relationship."></p>

<p>Who are these highly-trusted users? They’re who you’d expect: bots for large projects (e.g. <code>types</code>), corporate accounts (e.g. <code>fb</code>), and the maintainers of extremely popular open-source libraries (e.g. <code>sindresorhus</code>, who maintains e.g. <code>string-length</code>).</p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, this web of trust exhibits some useful structures. A number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly connected components</a> emerge – groups of users that, roughly speaking, all trust each other according to the web of trust principles (i.e. if I trust Alice, and Alice trusts Bob, then I trust Bob, too). All of these connected components are small, with the exception of a single one that’s home to over 11,000 users<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. This core component – we’ll call it the <strong>strong set</strong> – could provide a starting point for a measure of trust in the npm ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can quantify trust in a slightly more nuanced way than simply looking at the in-degree of each npm user. The PageRank algorithm provides such a measure that takes into account the trustworthiness of the people who trust me. For example, I may only be trusted by one user, but if that user is <code>isaacs</code> (the creator of npm) then that trust relationship counts for a lot! After running PageRank, the 10 “most-trusted” users are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>types</code></li>
  <li><code>sindresorhus</code></li>
  <li><code>angular</code></li>
  <li><code>m1tk4</code></li>
  <li><code>tjholowaychuk</code></li>
  <li><code>google-wombot</code></li>
  <li><code>fb</code></li>
  <li><code>isaacs</code></li>
  <li><code>gaearon</code></li>
  <li><code>yyx990803</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these are unsurprising. However, <code>m1tk4</code> stands out: they only maintain two rarely-downloaded libraries. Because one of these libraries is used by the BBC, <code>m1tk4</code> is implicitly trusted by a large number of relatively trustworthy BBC employees who maintain other, more popular projects. This demonstrates how PageRank diffuses trust across the social network of npm maintainers. In fact, <code>m1tk4</code> is not a member of the strong set mentioned earlier – but many of the users who trust them <em>are</em>. <code>m1tk4</code> just doesn’t trust those users back!</p>

<p>While PageRank gives a fun measure of trust, it’s a very rough model for the reasons mentioned earlier: it’s based on a pretty weak indication of real trust. However, it might be useful in detecting suspicious behaviours in npm, which is something we – or registry maintainers – need to do proactively if we want to stop supply-chain attacks. For example, it might be a red flag if a highly-trusted user suddenly starts using a library by someone with a PageRank-based-trust of close to 0. And regardless, the strong set comes merely from observing which dependencies people choose to use without applying any complex calculations.</p>

<p>How might we want to use the strong set to create a stricter trust (or reputation) system? I think that formalizing such a system is unlikely if it requires large-scale buy-in from npm users. Instead, we might create a simple wrapper for npm that checks if you’re about to install something from a developer outside of the strong set, similar to Liran Tal’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/lirantal/npq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npq</a>. Or perhaps security researchers could use the npm web of trust as an additional data point when deciding whether a suspicious package warrants further investigation. Either way, the state of trust within the npm ecosystem is not great. This model gives us a starting point.</p>

<p><em>Do you think I’ve got it all wrong? Or do you have further suggestions on how we can improve the state of trust in open source? <a href="https://www.btao.org/contact">Get in touch</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>A final note: this analysis is based on data from June 2020, which I collected for my Master’s thesis. I believe you’d reach similar numbers if you ran the analysis on data from today.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>A post on local recordings</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Since the advent of the COVID-19 situation, there has been an increase in the demand for recorded materials. Standard approaches involve Zoom, which is not only proprietary, but also quite a bit of a privacy nightmare. The last straw was the random placement of my speaker bauble head.</p><figure><img src="https://rgoswami.me/ox-hugo/2020-10-03_16-51-07_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 1: Zoom webcam placement"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Zoom webcam placement</p></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, given that I was to set up a pre-recorded video for <a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/pycon-in-2020-meta/">PyCon India 2020</a>, I decided to look into alternatives.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The search for alternative screen recording systems isn’t really a very new one. For group work (like <a href="https://wc3m.github.io/">W3cm</a>&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), I tend to prefer Skype, since it handles speaker galleries very well. Unfortunately, Skype has no capacity for recording single person calls, at least as yet. This is not the place for an extended debate on the pros and cons of Skype, or Google Meet (only records corporate accounts), or the rest. Instead, lets sum up all these issue with the simple understanding that, if <strong>one person</strong> wants to record a webcam connected to their local computer, along with the screen, it is insane to imagine that the only way to get this is by:</p><ul><li>Making an account somewhere (Zoom, Meet, Skype, anything)</li><li>Giving a cloud service permission to record our screens</li></ul><p>At the same time, a lot of standard tools for screen recording do not play nice with webcam recorders (like <a href="https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/">Simple Screen Recorder</a> and <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/cheese/stable/">Cheese</a>).</p><h2 id="open-broadcaster-software">Open Broadcaster Software</h2><p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obs+studio&amp;ia=web">OBS studio project</a> is a godsend. It allows for simultaneously managing multiple streams, of both audio and video. Furthermore, since these are implemented as overlays, it is possible to fine-tune the positioning of each of these, which is something Zoom and friends lack.</p><figure><img src="https://rgoswami.me/ox-hugo/2020-10-03_16-53-51_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 2: Into the matrix"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: Into the matrix</p></figcaption></figure><p>The ability to resize the webcam is best shown in the figure below.</p><figure><img src="https://rgoswami.me/ox-hugo/2020-10-03_16-58-26_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 3: Almost Zoom, only better"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: Almost Zoom, only better</p></figcaption></figure><p>OBS also generates beautifully small videos and supports live-streaming.</p><h3 id="common-caveats">Common Caveats</h3><ul><li>The standard setting is set to work with hardware acceleration, which may not be present for many users<ul><li>Use the settings to change this back to the software setting</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>I cannot imagine going back to Zoom to record anything local. It is an added bonus that OBS is both cross-platform and FOSS. It is only incredible more people do not use it.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Water, Chemicals and more with Computers for Chemistry, a computational chemistry course aimed at middle school students taught with my sister <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mviv92EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Amrita Goswami</a> <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></div></div>]]>

It can be slower since you have to search the text, and doesn’t work in all circumstances. But when it works, it does save quite a few clicks, especially because you can select the button with ⌃ (Ctrl) + index, similar to Vimium’s indexing of links.

Some of these tools work well in isolation, and others work better together in combination with each other and with native app shortcuts or OS shortcuts.

      <div>
        <p>This is a list of tools I use to increase my privacy on the Internet. I'm not a security expert. My goal is to have a good enough protection. Feel free to suggest any additions and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343120-ed616080-e00d-11ea-9451-f2c69ada5246.jpg" alt="firefox"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/">Firefox</a> probably doesn't need an introduction. It is an open-source project. It's run by Mozilla - a non-profit organization. Anyone can go to the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">Firefox repository</a> to take a look at the code and see how it works.</p>
<p>Firefox doesn't gather your personal data to serve you ads as Chrome. While Google seems careful and to an extend trustworthy with handling people's personal data, you don't seem to have much control how your profile is built and used.</p>
<p>The browser is constantly being improved. It seems slightly heavier than Chrome or Safari on my computer, but that's a minor issue compared to all the advantages. I use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Developer Edition</a>.</p>
<h2 id="little-snitch">Little Snitch</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343121-edf9f700-e00d-11ea-91d7-a2a876111ca1.jpg" alt="Little Snitch"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/">Little Snitch</a> is a MacOS application that  monitors connections and lets you control inbound and outbound traffic from your computer. It visualizes these connections and shows where applications connect. This way you have information about both familiar and unfamiliar network actions that applications are trying to perform.</p>
<h2 id="pihole-adguard">PiHole &amp; AdGuard</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343124-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8f26-f4dcbdf189d6.jpg" alt="Pi Hole">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343113-e9cdd980-e00d-11ea-8d17-642c01565237.jpg" alt="AdGuard"></p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> &amp; <a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a> are ad blockers. PiHole is open-source while AdGuard is a paid offering. I use one at home and the other one at the office. AdGuard is slightly easier to setup and use. Both work network-wide, but AdGuard also provides standalone applications and browser plugins to protect from ads when being outside of private networks.</p>
<h2 id="nibspace">Nibspace</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343122-ee928d80-e00d-11ea-950f-3514adfca5fa.jpg" alt="Nibspace"></p>
<p><a href="https://nibspace.com/">Nibspace</a> is an alternative to Google Analytics. It provides basic information about the visitors of my websites. It doesn't use cookies and it has a small footprint (~ 1kb) while being affordable ($1/mo per domain). It's not open-source. There are few other, notable competitors such as <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343117-ec303380-e00d-11ea-828d-c0bf960154a2.png" alt="Bitwarden"></p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is an open-source password manager. I used to use 1Password, but I wanted something more affordable yet with similar features and Bitwarden fits the bill perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="nordvpn">NordVPN</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343123-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8026-de472ec96bc6.jpg" alt="Nord VPN"></p>
<p><a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> is a personal virtual private network service provider. Their marketing seems aggressive, so I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but then I decided to give it a try. Overall, NordVPN is one of the most polished and reliable VPNs I've used so far.</p>
<p>I also like that they show some innovation efforts, namely their NordLynx technology that is built around WireGuard - this relatively new VPN tunneling protocol</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21312609">NordVPN was hacked</a>, but they handled the whole situation pretty well in my view.</p>
<h2 id="fastmail">Fastmail</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343118-ecc8ca00-e00d-11ea-938b-7e9f884e8a6d.jpg" alt="Fastmail"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> is a paid e-mail service that focuses on privacy and doesn't display ads. It is a simple service to manage e-mails, calendars and contacts. It costs $5/mo. It is also fast. This is partly related to their work on a more reliable, faster IMAP alternative, called <a href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP</a> - so it goes beyond just a snappy UI.</p>

So, today I’m sharing my life experience about how I made good money with my product in less than 48 hours.</p><p>I solved 10 problems I faced with MVP &amp; launch on ProductHunt.</p><p>After all those, I build my first SAAS product that related to API called NoCodeAPI.com</p><p>NoCodeAPI - The easiest way to connect your Google Sheet, Airtable, Google Analytics, Twitter, Telegram, Open Graph API, MailChimp, 50+ application APIs without any backend.</p><p><img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2020-10-03 at 6 37 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9165019/94992426-9ad10900-05a7-11eb-91d9-5fff09b4f1a6.png"></p><p>I Build NoCodeAPI MVP in 20 days. Finally, launch on ProductHunt on 12th January 2020 &amp; tweeted also. Everyone was loving it &amp; this was #1 product of the day. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nocodeapi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nocodeapi</a></p><p>My tweet got 100k+ impression &amp; 17k media views.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf/status/1215947112187228161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf/status/1215947112187228161</a></p><p>On the launch day, I got my first 3 paid customers &amp; more than 1200 signups. The launch was really successful but I learn one thing after 6 months that it’s easy to keep running a business &amp; get money from the customer pocket.</p><p>I made $2960 profit until 31-July-2020 but the growth was not good that I was expecting. But, One thing I realized that people need this product and I have to work more on market the product than develop new features.</p><p>One of my mentors told me that if you can get validate the idea &amp; people are paying for your service. Don’t give up just keep working on it and keep iterate according to what the user needs. So, I also get more confidence that Yes, this will be going to good.</p><p>Couple of things I did after that in Marketing:</p><ol start="1"><li>Made YouTube channels &amp; record videos for all the APIs. -&gt; Got Good traffic</li><li>Weekly email newsletter about new updates, integration, &amp; pricing update in the bottom -&gt; Got good conversion to paid users</li><li>Auto-mated email when free users cross API usage by 50%, 75%, &amp; 100% to upgrade plan.</li><li>Write content about the use-cases for the APIs.</li><li>Video call with the free &amp; paid customers if they need any help.</li><li>Improve the documentation part more easy &amp; simple for users.</li><li>I also keep adding one integration every week.</li></ol><p>After all these things I was able to get $850 MRR until and this was pretty great.</p><p>I see people were launching Lifetime deals and made more than 10k in 2 days.</p><p>I was working on NoCodeAPI 2.0 with a new dashboard &amp; I decide to launch a new version with 100 Lifetime deals launch offer. I was calculating that if I made this then I could be a millionaire in my country in 2 days and if I got failed then this will be a great lesson for my journey.</p><p>You guys can’t believe that I was getting mad and my heart was pumping. I was getting stripe notion on every 10 minutes. Someone bought Business Plan Lifetime subscription for $249. I was getting so excited &amp; feeling a high responsibility for the users.</p><p>And finally, the experiment was really successful &amp; I made $20,228 in less than 48 hours. I become the first solo millionaire in my country within 2 days.</p><p>It’s not about I never made that much money in my life, I sold the first product I build in Jan’2019 for $23k. The point is this money from my first SAAS product. </p><p>This all my experience with this experiment &amp; I’m seeing a huge potential with the product. I’m still working hard to make the product more mature &amp; profitable.</p><p>That's all.</p><p>I'll keep writing about my real-life experience. You can follow on twitter for the next story. <a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf</a></p><p>Peace.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

		<span title="Time">6:14 pm</span>
		
		<span title="Category"><a href="http://tubetime.us/index.php/category/cleverness/" rel="category tag">Cleverness</a></span>
		<span></span>
		<span><p>The Sound Blaster 1.0 was not the first PC sound card, but it was the first to support digital sound, two different types of sound synthesis, MIDI, and a joystick all in one card. Let’s lift the hood and examine how the card does its magic.<br>
You can follow along by <a href="https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/SnarkBarker.pdf">looking at the schematic here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Playback</strong><br>
There are three methods a Sound Blaster card uses to play back digital audio.</p>
<p><strong>Direct DAC</strong><br>
The first is called Direct DAC and it means that the PC software has to feed the sound card each sample at just the right time. It works a lot like the parallel-port DACs that people used to build in the 80s and 90s, or like the Disney Sound Source. When you send a data byte to the sound card, it immediately changes the analog signal going into the speaker amplifier.</p>
<p>Software using this method typically sets up a periodic timer interrupt. In the interrupt handler, the new sample is calculated and then fed to the sound card for playback.</p>
<p>Although it’s a simple method, it produces extra noisy playback to due the timing jitter of the interrupt handler. Because PC interrupts are non-deterministic, the samples don’t occur at precisely the sampling rate. This timing difference means that the waveform being reproduced doesn’t match the source material, and the difference in voltage sounds like noise or hiss.</p>
<p><strong>DMA DAC</strong><br>
The other method uses the DMA (Direct Memory Access) controller on the PC motherboard to automatically send samples to the sound card. It does require a little bit more work to set up the operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>The software configures the PC’s DMA controller (historically an Intel 8237) with the source address and length. The DMA controller is set to perform a single transfer per DMA request (DREQ).</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster is configured for a particular sampling rate. It programs an internal timer to generate a DREQ signal at the sampling rate.</li>
<li>The software sends the playback command to the Sound Blaster.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next operations happen in a loop until all the samples have been played back. Notice that the software is not involved at all—just the DMA controller, the Sound Blaster, and main memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sound Blaster asserts DREQ.</li>
<li>The DMA controller responds by asserting DACK (DMA Acknowledge) at the same time it places the memory address and memory chip select onto the bus. The data byte gets transferred directly from main memory into the Sound Blaster input register!</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster takes this data and sends it to the audio DAC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the Sound Blaster ends playback then triggers an interrupt to let the software know that it is done with playback.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Initialize DMA DAC</strong><br>
The final method, introduced with the Sound Blaster 2.0, is very similar to the previous method, except the ending. The Sound Blaster triggers an interrupt as before, but then it reloads the sample counter to the original value and continues requesting samples from the DMA controller!</p>
<p>The usual way software uses this feature is to create a seamless digital audio stream using a double buffer. The DMA controller gets a buffer that is twice as big as the number of samples that the Sound Blaster is programmed to play back. Because of that, the interrupt gets triggered halfway through buffer playback. In the interrupt handler, the software then loads a new set of samples into the buffer half that has already been played. When playback hits the end of the DMA buffer, the interrupt triggers again, only this time the software refills the last half of the DMA buffer. The DMA controller then wraps around to the beginning of the buffer and playback continues unbroken.</p>
<p>One of the side effects of this approach is that if the software crashes, the DMA controller and sound card continue to play back the sample buffer in a loop. You may have heard this when playing old DOS games back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Recording</strong><br>
This works in very much the same way as playback including the Direct mode, DMA mode, and Auto-Init DMA modes, except data gets transferred in the opposite direction, from the sound card into main memory.</p>
<p>One interesting wrinkle is that the Sound Blaster doesn’t actually have a proper ADC (analog-to-digital converter)! Instead it uses a clever circuit and an algorithm to accomplish the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>An input filter processes the incoming sound to smooth out any high frequency transients. This is common practice, even with an ADC, to help prevent sampling-induced aliasing, but it it’s helpful for making the trick work.</li>
<li>A comparator looks at the difference between the audio DAC and the incoming signal. The output of the comparator is only one bit; it can only tell if the incoming signal is greater than or less than the setting of the audio DAC.</li>
<li>The DSP starts the audio DAC at the halfway point, then looks at the comparator output. The comparator output gets recorded as the most significant bit of the audio sample.</li>
<li>Depending on the bit, the DSP sets the audio DAC up or down half again—either 25% or 75%.</li>
<li>The DSP repeats steps 3 and 4, going halfway again and again until it’s obtained the 8 bits of a complete sample.</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique is known as successive approximation, and it’s a technique used in many ADC chips. The code looks something like this:<br>
<code><br>
mov	p1,#80h		; Start DAC at the halfway point, 1000 0000<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Put comparator output into carry bit<br>
mov	p1.7,c			; 2 If greater, then leave MSB as is. If less, clear MSB<br>
setb	p1.6			; 1 Set DAC to upper or lower halfway point<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Check comparator output again<br>
mov	p1.6,c			; 2 Rinse and repeat<br>
setb	p1.5<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.5,c<br>
setb	p1.4<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.4,c<br>
setb	p1.3<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.3,c<br>
setb	p1.2<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.2,c<br>
setb	p1.1<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.1,c<br>
setb	p1.0<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.0,c<br>
mov	a,p1			; We are done, copy DAC code into accumulator.</code></p>
<p><strong>The Hardware, Section By Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Address Decoder</strong><br>
The address decoder takes the I/O port address off the ISA bus and looks for accesses at 210h, 220h, 230h, 240h, 250h, or 260h depending on the jumper setting. It also looks for 388h and 389h so that it can make the Yamaha OPL2 chip appear there for Adlib compatibility. It also decodes 0x200-207h as the joystick port (each address is actually the same).</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/address-decoder.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/address-decoder.png" alt="" width="490" height="177"></a></p>
<p>A jumper, JP1, can be pulled to shut off the PC joystick port. The MIDI function still works, however. Many combo-IO boards came with a built-in joystick port so the one on the Sound Blaster may not always be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Reset Circuit</strong><br>
It’s important to make sure the card powers up in a good state without generating spurious noises, so the SB uses the ISA RESET signal to clear the OPL2, the CMS chips, the joystick one-shot, and basically all of the other internal state latches.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png" alt="" width="496" height="159"></a></p>
<p>There is also an IO port that, if you write a 1 to it, resets the DSP and its associated bus interface. (You also have to write a 0 to it afterwards to allow the DSP to start operating.) Later versions of the DSP require this to exit high speed auto-init DMA mode, since in this mode, the DSP devotes 100% CPU to servicing DMA requests.</p>
<p><strong>DSP</strong><br>
The core of the digital sound capabilities of the Sound Blaster is the Digital Sound Processor, or DSP for short. It’s not actually a Digital Signal Processor in the traditional sense—it’s just an 8051 microcontroller with custom firmware.</p>
<p>The DSP also handles MIDI transmit and receive using the 8051’s built-in UART.</p>
<p><strong>DSP Bus Interface</strong><br>
The bus interface allows the host PC to talk to the DSP. It uses two unidirectional 8-bit registers as a “mailbox,” temporary holding areas for a single data byte. One is for PC-to-DSP communications, and the other is for DSP-to-PC communications. There are also two data flip flops that are used to signal when data is available in one of the registers.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png" alt="" width="349" height="362"></a></p>
<p>When the PC sends data to the DSP (I/O port 2XCh), the data gets stored in an 8-bit register and the flip-flop is automatically set high (DAV_DSP).</p>
<p>When the DSP reads the register, the flip-flop gets cleared automatically.</p>
<p>When the DSP sends data to the PC, the data goes into the other 8-bit register and the other flip-flop automatically gets set (DAV_PC). The PC can check this bit by reading from I/O port 2XEh. When it reads from I/O port 2XAh, it receives the byte of data and the flip-flop automatically gets cleared. The DSP can see that the PC has read the byte by checking the DAV_PC input. The DSP often checks this pin to make sure the PC has read a data byte before writing a new data byte to the register, otherwise the byte in the register will be lost before the PC has a chance to read it.</p>

<p><strong>Interrupts</strong><br>
When the DSP is done with a particular (often lengthy) task, it can signal the host PC by asserting the interrupt line. It does this by pulsing IREQUEST which triggers a flip-flop that asserts the IRQ line on the PC bus. On the host PC, the interrupt handler is supposed to clear the interrupt by reading from I/O port 2XEh. This simply clears the flip-flop which then deasserts the IRQ line.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png" alt="" width="426" height="281"></a></p>
<p><strong>DMA</strong><br>
When the DSP needs a new sample from the PC (or needs to transfer a new sample to the PC during record mode), it pulses the DREQUEST line. Note that the DSP also needs to enable DMA by asserting its DMA_EN# line. When DREQUEST pulses, it causes the DMA request flip-flop to output a 1 on the DRQ1 line. The PC’s DMA controller responds by asserting DACK1#, which clears the flip-flop. DACK1# also bypasses the address decode logic of the Sound Blaster and forces it to either accept data from or place data on the ISA bus lines. This data transfer happens between the ISA bus and the mailbox registers.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Audio Output</strong><br>
An 8-bit DAC connected to the 8051 generates an analog current corresponding with the digital code on its inputs. A current-to-voltage converter (U5C) changes the current into a voltage that is used by the rest of the circuit. This voltage goes through an antialiasing filter which removes distinctive- and ugly-sounding artifacts from the audio signal. U5A implements this filter using a Sallen-Key design. The filter cutoff frequency is about 4KHz, …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>The French language</strong> offers two ways of speaking about freedom: <em>libre arbitre</em> means â€˜free will;â€™ <em>volontÃ©</em> means â€˜the willâ€™ or, better, â€˜volitionâ€™. Each carries with it distinct conceptual baggage. On the one hand, we exercise free will when making a choice. For volition, on the other hand, our freedom amounts to an exertion of effort. One is intellectual; the other laborious. Although you could get away with using either in everyday conversation, the choice of one term rather than the other is consequential. Indeed, the history of this semantic rift spills beyond the French language. It reveals a fissure at the core of what it means to author oneâ€™s own life story.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, disputes over the nature of freedom were all-consuming in France. Thatâ€™s not only because political upheavals rocked the 19th century. In the wake of the 1789 French Revolution, men and women experienced radical democracies, military dictatorships, resurgent monarchies and constitutional republics â€“ a living exercise in political science during which questions of <em>libertÃ©</em> (another term for â€˜freedomâ€™) preoccupied national debates.</p>
<p>A scientific revolution also ignited beyond the Palace of Versailles, setting the fates of free will and volition on a collision course. The rise of psychology and neurology threw into disarray the terms with which people made sense of their selfhood. By the beginning of the 20th century, the young sciences showed how freedom involves our entire bodies; indeed, it penetrates far deeper into our being than mere choice.</p>
<p>The philosopher and psychologist Maine de Biran (1766-1824) led the vanguard. During a long political career, from the court of Louis XVI to the lower house of parliament â€“ an institution created after the brothers of the executed king took over the throne in 1815 â€“ Biran used his influence to gather the foremost French scientists. They studied the mind as part of the body. At a time when the nervous systemâ€™s workings were only beginning to be understood, the gatherings were, for some, an occasion to dispel freedom as an illusion. Emblematic was the physiologist Pierre-Jean-George Cabanis (1757-1808) who claimed that â€˜The brain secretes thought like the liver secretes bile.â€™ Material enquiry, and not the abstract notion of free will, was to explain our agency.</p>
<p>Biran saw the fledgling brain sciences otherwise. In his work <em>The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking</em> (1802), Biran showed how our freedom hinges on volition, which canâ€™t be easily confined to the space between our ears. Materialist scientists tilted at windmills, so Biran charged. The idea of free will is a fiction because our freedom needs friction.</p>
<p>Biranâ€™s insight was that our nervous system is not a cause of volition but its constraint. In putting our body to use, we exert effort and encounter resistance. The play between the two â€“ their modulation over time â€“ gives rise to habits. According to Biran, habit follows a double law: â€˜the less we feel, the more we perceiveâ€™. Before I studied the French language, the silent consonants and serous liaisons struck my ears like an indistinguishable mÃ©lange. By focusing on individual words, contorting my tongue and taking risks to speak, I eventually came to inhabit the language. Thanks to my sustained volition, a cacophony of foreign sounds eventually gave way to meaningful speech. For Biran, the paradigmatic habit is self-education.</p>
<p>His book overthrew the longstanding view that habit is blind repetition. RenÃ© Descartes and Immanuel Kant had condemned habits as mechanical routines. They cloud clear judgment. For Biran, however, the discrete decisions of our free will matter less than the direction of our volition over time. And as habits take over, new resistance mounts. My patterns of thought and verbal crutches take the place of intentional speech. When I find myself lost in conversation at a cocktail party, <em>voilÃ&nbsp;</em> rolls off my tongue instinctively whenever I feel itâ€™s time to wrap up. Habits open an opportunity to renew our efforts and overcome the resistance that takes over within us.</p>
<p><strong>In the 19th century</strong>, psychology and politics revolved in the same orbit. Uprisings sought to replace old monarchical habits with new democratic ones. Biran, however, was no democrat. He applauded NapolÃ©onâ€™s brief return from exile in 1815. The French deserved an emperor who would strengthen peopleâ€™s volition, which had been weakened by the unruly sentiments of popular sovereignty. Biranâ€™s vision of selfhood was as consistent as his politics was lamentable, tethered as it was to an enduring aristocratic disposition.</p>
<p>Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood</p>
<p>In the eyes of European liberals, the new social orderâ€™s success hinged on a different form of freedom â€“ free will. Universal male suffrage and market economies, both established with yet another French revolution in 1848, introduced novel decision-making capacities. The prolific polymath Charles Renouvier (1815-1903) argued that citizensâ€™ <em>libre arbitre</em> usurped the reign of God and monarch. We occupy the role of judge (following the Latin, <em>arbitrium</em>) who renders a decision, as it were, in the court of the mind. To act with a free will, we â€˜place the government of our innermost spirit in the hands of a single ideaâ€™. Renouvier spent the decade of 1854-64 writing his <em>Essays of General Critique</em>, a project to translate the individual will into the driving force of national regeneration. Government would thereby find its legitimacy in the voluntary consent of citizens.</p>
<p>National regeneration was the chief <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wsfh/0642292.0042.015/--brain-in-the-third-republic-science-pedagogy-and-national?rgn=main;view=fulltext" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">goal</a> of the Third Republic, which reinvigorated disputes between free will and volition. It was the longest democratic regime in the countryâ€™s history, lasting from 1870 to the Nazi occupation in 1940. Following its inception, investment in science was a national priority. Fidelity to the <em>patrie</em> was to be not only free but also rational.</p>
<p>When the first experimental psychology laboratories broke ground in the 1880s, their focus was psychometrics. Reaction time experiments allowed researchers to track the time of thinking, feeling and willing. They ranged between .1 and .3 seconds (the time from the reception of stimuli in the brain to the movement of a limb). The mathematical revolution in the study of mind also set in motion projects to scale intellectual aptitude â€“ Alfred Binet (1857-1911) released the first IQ measure in 1905 â€“ and to rationalise colonial conquests of â€˜uncivilisedâ€™ people in West Africa and Indochina. A trenchant materialism characterised the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, a period during which faith in numbers drove projects to hierarchise human freedom.</p>
<p>Critics returned to Biranâ€™s ideas. For Alfred FouillÃ©e (1838-1912), quantitative psychology demonstrated that thoughts constitute powerful motor actions â€“ what he called <em>idea-forces.</em> Their duration fluctuates with the obstacles we confront. In documenting the time taken to make decisions, experimental research didnâ€™t make freedom predictable so much as it laid to rest the idea of unencumbered free will. Such was the case in liberal politics as well: our choices (left or right, buy or sell) reflect the surface of our freedom. Deeper, FouillÃ©e believed, was a fleshly understanding of volition entangled with the bodyâ€™s sensory-motor coordination.</p>
<p>The philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941) went a step further. In an <em>oeuvre</em> that was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature, Bergson showed how we experience the world as a <em>lived duration</em>. As he saw it, psychometrics recorded the trace left by our volition, much like a marathonâ€™s final standings indicate when runners pass the finish line. Within the flow of time, however, our freedom fluctuates between exertions of energy and effortless passivity. When I reflect inward on the life I live, I notice discrete decisions: the choice of college majors, career paths and romantic partners. When I probe deeper, the volition shaping my self comes into view â€“ that is, the kind of person I continuously strive to become â€“ and with it the constraints that have lent traction to my creativity. Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood.</p>
<p>Today, choice-making is central to economic forecasting, political analysis and psychological testing. Market data and survey metrics aggregate our collective decisions. Although our world is distant from that of France a century ago, the countryâ€™s thinkers offer an enduring reminder that our aspirations for freedom do not amount to one thing. Do we seek more choices? Or do we strive to resist the sediments of time â€“ that is, to make our selfhood anew?</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="blog-page"><div><div><div><article><div><div><h2>Vets Who Code: What, Where, And How to Help</h2></div><p>When I started this journey&nbsp;<span>SIX</span>&nbsp;years ago, I just wanted to create an affordable solution for veterans to transition into the workforce as fast as they can without the hurdles of civilian life of trying to find a code school that accepts the GI Bill. I didn’t want my fellow troops in transition to fall through the cracks, like I did.</p><p>That’s why I went into the nonprofit sector in the first place. I wanted to help my brothers and sisters. What I found was a system designed, not to help them, but, to get as much money out of donors, sponsors and government agencies as possible by telling the story of how the nation fails our servicemen and women; all the while creating extremely high requirements, yet, having extremely low benchmarks for success. Did you know that unless you are actually sleeping on the streets in some states you aren’t considered homeless? Meaning, if you are living out of your car, living out of a hotel room, or couch-surfing, you don’t qualify for certain support services.</p><p>I should know — I’ve had the great displeasure of doing all three. Despite the adversity, perseverance enabled me to climb out of the darkness, with a deep desire to keep other veterans from falling into the abyss. Thinking back, that was the hardest six months of my life! It was development and design that helped me get through those tough times, not the current nonprofit sector filled with relics that have cozy relationships all the while doing the minimum.</p><p>I spent every waking moment learning skills that other people were either too stubborn or just too fearful to learn, and it added value to me — value the civilian sector could understand. Then, when a fallen soldier’s family needed help, my newly minted value empowered me to answer the call to bury a brother. Afterwards, I was like “what do I do next?” — leading to the stupid idea of turning something old (a freaking castle!) into something new, repurposing it to retrain veterans in real and digital skillsets. Unfortunately that didn’t work. But, out of it came true inspiration, something revamped, brilliant, and functional — something I hope would even make David Heinemeier Hansson (my hero) proud.</p><p><span>What is Vets Who Code?</span></p><p>Vets Who Code is a veteran founded, lead and operated 501(c)(3) distributed charitable non-profit, dedicated to filling the wide chasm between technical expertise needed and available with transitioning veterans and active duty military spouses through software development training and education. We utilize our distributed model for the capability to train veterans anywhere, but we are so much more. We are a team of people with hybrid tech skills and a lean mentality, focused on helping veterans not only learn how to program, but get jobs in the field and to do it without the unnecessary bloat that other nonprofits take on. From UX and DevOPs engineers to little old me, who got thrown into this because I simply wanted to help my fellow veterans, which is the most important part of this nonprofit. Currently 80% of the team is veterans, and we provide what you need to surpass our successes and learn from our mistakes. ’Cause if we are to celebrate this thing called life, we need to be there together.</p><p><span>Why Code?</span></p><p>Great question. Right now our country has a problem: we have programming jobs, but not enough programmers. Not only that, we don’t have enough GOOD programmers. On top of that, while it’s definitely better, veterans are still the highest unemployed demographic in America. So we had this crazy idea. What if we created a vetted curriculum designed around modern technologies? Not just any veterans, those who this skill could really impact. Not only that, let’s work tirelessly to mentor them in professional standards of code, business, and design. Can you imagine how much better you get at design thinking when the guy speaking has been thinking about it every day for the last 15 years? We then thought, what if we added tools to continue learning after you’ve dealt with us for 15 weeks? Our partners like Frontend Masters and Google Cloud give us amazing tools to gift the veterans so that they can learn and prep for up to a year. Not only that — we make introductions, and train them in the interview process to help them get jobs in the industry. You know what? It works. Our troops have been getting highly paid positions, and we couldn’t be happier. Here we empower amazing people to have the lifestyle they have earned, and we do it all online; a feat that wasn’t even possible 10 years ago.</p><p><span>How Can You Help?</span></p><p>That’s actually a question we get quite often. Our veterans spend 15 weeks with our team focusing on the language JavaScript and and all it encompasses, and understanding software architecture and computer science fundamentals. We focus on having workflows, interview questions, computer science, and UX research.</p><p>The most important thing you can do to support our mission is&nbsp;<a href="https://donorbox.org/vetswhocode-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>donate</span></a>. As a 501(c)(3) we are tax-deductible, and as a distributed non-profit, we don't have any wasteful operating cost. All proceeds go directly to resources and cool things for the troops.</p><p>If you’re a software engineer with at least two years experience working with ES6 and Javascript, sign up as a mentor. If you are a designer who can code, we are always looking for someone to help us with our user experience. If you are in HR, drop us a line in our contact form, so that we can get our troops into your pipeline for javascript jobs.</p></div></article></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

                    <p><em>The last piece of hair fell on the floor.</em></p><p><em>My head was shining like a moon.</em></p><p><em>“Tomorrow, I’ll be in China.”</em></p><hr><p><strong><strong>In the first week of June, I was stuck.</strong></strong></p><p>We desperately needed to come up with a startup idea. Our company was in free fall, and I had to do something about it.</p><p>But I couldn’t.</p><p>I spent weeks trying to figure it all out in my head. Every day, we would sit for hours in the office. Trying to understand what we really want to work on. Brainstorming ideas. Nothing worked.</p><p>I had the idea to take some time off for a while. But I never really explored it. I’ve always believed the only way to solve a problem is to start working on it. A mere thought of lying on a beach all day long and doing nothing caused physical pain in my head.</p><p>After a few weeks of struggle, I accepted that we’re not moving anywhere.</p><p><strong><strong>I needed a change.</strong></strong></p><p>I used to do martial arts as a kid. I remember when I first read about Shaolin. I was amazed. It seemed like something sacred, unreal to me. Very distant, but also very close in some way.</p><p>I remember begging parents to allow me to go there and train with monks.</p><p><em>“You’re out of your damn mind!”</em></p><p>I’m not blaming them; I’d probably tell my kids the same.</p><p>But now I had no excuse.</p><p>I decided to fly to China and study Kung Fu at The Shaolin Temple.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q3pS6-bIyhrxVRndWfaux_yN_-PJBPebn2jwQJHImjIMygREWwyR3Wc8w0kILJgijhjt0r-d4BIdoeT3qsZO7VEfvQpbh5pVHakdASf1Q03R6s4clJWAUA0EjgxqNDkCdRKFH1ek" alt=""></figure><p>The Shaolin Monastery is like Mecca for Buddhists.</p><p>It’s a mysterious place where monks live, train, and meditate.</p><p><em>Some of them never leave the temple.</em></p><p>And while you can visit the temple as a tourist, there’s no way for a stranger to get into the private part of the monastery, where real monks train. There’s no website where you can apply. No email address.</p><p>But I had a plan.</p><p>I decided to find a martial arts school in Dengfeng, which is a small town 12 km from the temple. My idea was to get to Dengfeng, and then try to meet some younger monks from the temple and beg them to death to let me in.</p><p>After a few days of research, I found a school that seemed reasonable and applied.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YDuca6U-Xj9WUbeyshjgYpN2oWYZXvEXofbvILQW7t-j-FljoSA9TjA_S3LTvOHsMWiiltMTuraj13qtDORfzWvbY_nxeqM6fI6xt_5bRC4wVUUuIYjFu-gBo6lLeZZFXbXzfbRz" alt=""><figcaption>Shifu and students.

We’re shutting down.”</em></p><p>That’s what I heard from the school 24 hours before the flight.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>Finding this school was tough. There are hundreds of fake “Shaolin Kung Fu” schools in Dengfeng. They’re making money off the Shaolin brand, but there’s no real, authentic, hard training involved.</p><p>Getting another good one to accept me over night seemed impossible. But I kept looking.</p><p>I was looking for something original and challenging. And all Kung Fu schools I’d seen before were like holiday camps.</p><p>A few hours later, serendipity kicked into play.</p><p>I found a YouTube video from a former Xing Long student. I loved it. I went on their website and smiled.</p><p>The website said:</p><p><strong><strong>“Our school is not a holiday retreat.”</strong></strong></p><p>On a warm night of June 14th, I landed in Beijing.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ku0IQGnR2GgIWEcrPMlgo-wFYzrsanZT3agAhjOq95QJNZmS9Axi2I1MxXmN6KBHi_bmHD50q7RsO96dWnjovN83jDGHhEIxKdsCf1X3sgntgTe16-EmsHXw3DmGMWNzPWdNWwrn" alt=""><figcaption>4:30 a.m. Meeting the dawn at a Beijing Railway Station.</figcaption></figure><p>When I arrived in Beijing, I still hadn’t heard from Xing Long.</p><p>But I had no choice. I was in China, and coming back was not an option. So I bought a train ticket and embarked on 600 km journey to northern China.</p><p>After six hours of slumber in the high-speed train, I was in Siping.</p><p>At the exit of the train station, three students of Xing Long waited for me with a welcoming sign, “Vasili Shynkarenka.” They drove me to school.</p><p>That’s when I met the Master for the first time.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TDkN2V3FfpErJtZ5GeLWTX__0T2KMX_dKy1xq40UENQN6OiQUEgQ3JW4jE-mfU5ECQwI4TDTflt5wuf2lz6IlbswXzhZ2bdmKpH09BsWQYqPA8nGsR9vPe6v70TcWczFbhI4DO-M" alt=""></figure><p>Shifu is 5”2, fast as a jaguar, has a bone-crushing handshake and dark brown eyes that look right into your soul.</p><p>He once tore off someone’s shoulder with bare hands.</p><p>At 12, he already trained in Shaolin.</p><p>Shifu turned pro after seven years. He started competing professionally, won the famous “Kungfu King” tournament, and achieved the rank of a 7th-degree master at 19.</p><p>And then he broke his back. It was a full-contact sparring match, and he cracked his fourth vertebrae.</p><p>Doctors said he wouldn’t be able to walk ever again. Shifu made a full recovery in six months.</p><p>He couldn’t return to professional fighting, but life without Kung Fu was not an option to him.</p><p>He began teaching.</p><p>His vision was simple:</p><p><strong><strong>“To spread classic Shaolin skills throughout the world.”</strong></strong></p><p>To achieve that goal, Shifu had to learn English. He worked hard for 18 years, and he speaks almost fluently now.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Me and Shifu Wang.</figcaption></figure><p>Shifu believes that Shaolin Kung Fu is not just a martial art from Jackie Chan movies.</p><p>In its origin, Kung Fu refers to any discipline achieved through hard work.

<p><em>Guest blog post by <a href="https://lanebc.com/about/">Jay Michlin</a>, circa 1987 (used with permission). A recounting of a presentation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> at the <a href="https://www.pa-smug.org/">Stanford Macintosh User Group (SMUG)</a> </em></p>



<p>HyperCard. Bill Atkinson. The auditorium was packed and everyone stayed until the end.<br>What more need be said?</p>



<p>I considered stopping this month’s report right here, because the first paragraph already<br>tells volumes. But I never learned to quit while ahead, so here’s more. Specifically, I’m going to try to explain what HyperCard is, both as Bill described it and as I see it. As you’ll see, my perspective is somewhat different.</p>



<p>Bill said that HyperCard tries to make more of the power of a personal computer available to nonprogrammers. There’s plenty of goodness in using a computer for word processing, spreadsheets and other applications. But to unlock the real power, you have to program, and that’s very hard. HyperCard delivers a lot of the power of programming, but with minimal burden.</p>



<p>Or, you can look at the matter another way. Before HyperCard, the Mac had documents and applications. Documents contain information, but by themselves offer no opportunity for interaction with you. Applications offer interaction, but do not contain information. HyperCard stacks are in between, with a combination of both information and interaction inherent in them.</p>



<p>Or, you can think of HyperCard as a software erector set. It comes with a kit of tools, a set of instructions and lots of parts. Like an erector set, it has one more thing — examples. When you first get the set, you build copies of the ex amples. Then you change a few small details. Eventually you become comfortable with the tools and the parts and start using it fluidly to express your own, original ideas. In the same way, HyperCard comes with dozens of sample stacks. They’re not an afterthought. They’re an integral part of the product, intended to help you use it immediately and learn it quickly.</p>



<p>Here’s what I think. HyperCard is the latest in a long list of “languages” that seek to make<br>computers easy to program. The need is not new, the idea is not new and the solution is not new. What’s special about HyperCard is that it’s brilliantly executed. Biil obviously spent a lot of time thinking and learning about his task before, during and after sitting down to code.</p>



<p>Let me explain. For the early computers there were no such things as “canned” applications like word processors and spreadsheets. Everyone was a programmer. There was no choice. Then, in the 1960’s, timesharing was invented. The primary external feature that made timesharing different was that it supported users interacting with the computer at terminals.</p>



<p>But the users still had to program if they were to get the machine to do anything, As terminal access to timesharing became more widespread, especially on college campuses, everyone understood that programming was a barrier. So they invented BASIC.</p>



<p>Perhaps you thought that BASIC always was as it is today on personal computers. It wasn’t. It was expressly designed to help college students get over the programming barrier on early timesharing systems. It did that in a number of ways:</p>



<ul><li>It was interpretive. Users could type a command and get instant results printed on the terminal. It’s an elementary fact of life that we learn better if we have quick, useful feedback. </li><li>It made simple things simple. To print something on the terminal, you said, “PRINT.” There was no need to tell the computer how to find the terminal or what the printing format was to be. </li><li>It was small in that it had very few statements and options defined. Of course, that was partly because the computers and translators of the time would have struggled to give quick response on a complicated language. But even when more features were added, they remained in the background, invisible to novice users who don’t need them. </li><li>It came with clear, obvious examples, either as part of a college course or in a manual. You learned to write BASIC by trying the examples. BASIC worked. It helped a generation of college students learn to use computers. Later, it was the primary offering on commercial timesharing systems from Tymshare and General Electric. And most recently, it helped launch the personal computer revolution. It wasn’t so long ago that to use a personal computer at all, you had to program.</li></ul>



<p>Personal computers and their application software have grown sophisticated so fast that we easily forget that computers and programming go together. It’s tempting to say that to- day, in the modern era, programming is no longer needed. We all just go to Computer Ware and buy whatever package we need to make our machines do anything.</p>



<p>For many, perhaps that is true. But Bill Atkinson, and Apple are saying that you still need the opportunity to program to tap the underlying power of your computer. HyperCard will be the BASIC of the modern era, with possibly as profound an effect on the future as BASIC has had up to now.</p>



<p>Those are my words, not Bill’s. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he agreed.</p>



<p> * * * *</p>



<p>In case you missed the meeting, here are some details. Bill wasn’t there alone. Dan Winkler, who created HyperTalk, HyperCard’s internal scripting language, was also present. So was Danny Goodman, who wrote the book. Also Kristee Kreitman, who did the artwork (of which there is lots), Robin Shank, who helped do the testing, and Mike Holm, the Product Manager.</p>



<p>As an aside, this is an interesting illustration of the difference between a modern business enterprise and one from the last generation. A modern corporation values the natural benefits to all concerned when employees from all parts of the organization go out and meet customers. A more traditional corporation sends out only carefully prepared marketing teams.</p>



<p>Anyway, Bill demonstrated HyperCard and talked about the philosophy behind it. Then Dan told us about HyperTalk. He showed it to be a powerful, yet well-behaved language. Despite the fact that it underlies much of what goes on in HyperCerd, HyperTalk remains invisible be- hind the scenes if you don’t need or want to know about it.</p>



<p>Then Danny told us about two stacks he designed and is now selling commercially. The first, Business Class, presents a map of the world. Click anywhere and you can learn about language, currency, time zones, air travel and other important conditions. The second, Focal Point, is a very generalized and very interactive desk calendar and diary. Both are implemented as HyperCard stacks.</p>



<p>Incidentally, when you buy a HyperCard stack, you can copy and modify it the same way you can manipulate the example stacks that come with HyperCard itself. Apple’s whole approach is to make HyperCard a common tool, and stacks a common medium that people exchange and build on.</p>



<p>Finally, here are a few miscellancous points our guests made in response to questions.</p>



<p>HyperCard is roughly 360K of code, nearly ten times the sum of Bill’s original MacPaint and QuickDraw combined. HyperCard requires at least 1 MB or memory and the 128K ROMs. The team tried for 512K, but couldn’t make it.</p>



<p>The program contains some pioneering work Bill has done to compress bit maps. The com- pression feature brings two advantages. First, it minimizes disk space to store stacks. And second, it speeds response because the program has fewer bytes to move to and from disk. The feature typically achieves 10-to-1 compressions, with up to 30-to-1 not unusual.</p>



<p>Bill claims to be about two-thirds done with HyperCard. The product is now at a point “where you can build stacks and count on them still working five years from now…” The next features to be added are international features beginning in a month or two (Kanji will take longer) and CD-ROM support a bit later. Color is on the to-do list, but not at high priority.</p>



<p>The product’s current limits are 16 million cards and 500 MB total storage for a stack. And according to Bill, “If you run into those limits, we can change them together.”</p>



<p>Exit, to thunderous applause.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>On Monday, a group of researchers sponsored by Breakthrough Listen, the world’s largest SETI program, </span><a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu/lunarseti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted a paper</a><span> to National Academy of Sciences’ Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey that makes the case for establishing a SETI radio observatory on the farside of the moon. The decadal survey establishes scientific priorities for the next ten years and the new paper addresses one of the biggest problems facing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence today: The overwhelming amount of radio interference.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Our planet has become so “loud” in the part of the radio spectrum observed by SETI that it threatens to drown out any signal sent from an intelligent civilization. Not only would a lunar radio telescope not have to deal with terrestrial radio interference, it could also significantly increase our chances of hearing from ET by opening up parts of the radio spectrum that are blocked by Earth's atmosphere. While the idea of using the moon for radio astronomy is decades old, the researchers make the case that technological advancements have finally made a lunar SETI observatory truly feasible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>
says Eric Michaud, an intern at the SETI Berkeley Research Center and the first author of the paper. “Maybe not today, but I think it’s going to get more and more feasible as time goes on.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Radio interference has been a problem for SETI from the very beginning. In the spring of 1960, the planetary scientist Frank Drake trained the massive radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia on Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, two stars a mere 12 light years from Earth. That summer, Drake spent his days studying the signals picked up by Green Bank’s giant mechanical ear in the hopes of receiving a message broadcast by an alien civilization orbiting those stars. Known as Project Ozma, Drake’s experiment marked the beginning of SETI, the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Shortly after Drake started his observations, he was surprised to find what appeared to be a signal of intelligent origin. After days of watching a needle drift lazily over a spool of paper recording the random undulations of cosmic static, Drake and his colleagues were jolted awake when the machine started recording the frantic pulses of a strong radio signal picked up by the telescope. The timing and magnitude of the pulses clearly marked them as artificial; there was nothing in the natural world that could produce such a frenetic radio profile. It would have been an astounding stroke of luck to pick up an alien message after only a few hours of observation, but it was hard to argue with the data.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“None of us had ever seen anything like it,” Drake recalled in </span><em>Is Anyone Out There?</em><span>, his autobiographical book about the early days of SETI. “We looked at each other wide-eyed. Could discovery be this easy?”</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>

It was a letdown, but the false detection turned out to be a portent for the future of SETI. In the 60 years since Drake’s pioneering experiment, researchers have conducted dozens of SETI searches across thousands of stars and turned up empty-handed. At the same time, the sources of radio interference on Earth—military radars, TV towers, cell phones, and satellites—have exponentially increased, which greatly increases the chances that an extraterrestrial signal will be lost among the noise.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Earth was never a particularly great place to do any kind of radio astronomy due to our thick atmosphere blocking a large portion of the radio spectrum. The proliferation of radio communication technologies has only made things harder. The moon, by comparison, has no atmosphere and its nights last for weeks on end, which limits radio noise from the sun. And as&nbsp;NASA discovered through a spate of lunar orbiter missions in the late 1960s, the moon also acts as a natural shield that blocks radio signals emanating from Earth. As the planetary astronomer Phillipe Zarka has put it, “the farside of the moon during the lunar night is the most radio-quiet place in our local universe.” It’s exactly the sort of peace and quiet you want if you’re searching for faint radio signals from solar systems that might be hundreds of light years away.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>The new Breakthrough Listen paper proposed two main approaches to a lunar SETI observatory: an orbiter and a telescope on the surface. The basic idea behind a SETI lunar orbiter would be to scan for signals as it passed over the lunar farside and relay data back to Earth as it passed over the near side. One of the main advantages of an orbiter is cost. The proliferation of small satellites that are capable of accurate tracking combined with low-cost small launch providers like Rocket Lab means that a SETI orbiter could conceivably be sent to the moon </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-cubesat-to-moon-from-virginia/#:~:text=The%20firm%2Dfixed%2Dprice%20launch,Tyvak%20Nano%2DSatellite%20Systems%20Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for less than $20 million</a><span>. This would be a valuable pathfinder mission that could pave the way for a more ambitious observatory on the surface, but without the risk and cost.&nbsp; As the </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/the-supercluster-podcast-water-bears-might-now-occupy-the-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ill-fated Israeli Beresheet lander mission</a><span> reminded us, landing on the moon is extremely challenging even when the mission is backed by $100 million.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But a SETI lunar orbiter would also come with a lot of compromises. It would only be able to conduct observations during the brief stretches when it was on the lunar farside, which would make a sustained observation campaign more challenging. The upshot is that an orbiter would have access to the full sky, whereas a telescope on the surface would be constrained by the moon’s rotation. The biggest downside of an orbiter is that it might lose a lot of the shielding benefits of the moon and be more vulnerable to radio interference from Earth since it would be orbiting high above the lunar surface.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“The first SETI observations that are done from the lunar farside will be done from orbit, there’s no question about that,” says Andrew Siemion, the director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and the second author on the paper. “I think eventually we absolutely want to do something on the surface because we want to build a very large aperture telescope, but even when we’re at that point I don’t think that would negate the utility of doing things from orbit as well.”&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>So what would a SETI observatory on the moon look like? One idea is to use the naturally parabolic lunar crater as a radio dish, much like the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/chinas-massive-telescope-is-the-next-great-seti-hope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAST telescope in China</a><span>, which are built into natural depressions in the land. This idea was </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/RS012i005p00845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first considered</a><span> back in the late 1970s by a group of scientists at the radio physics lab at the Stanford Research Institute. Their idea was to recreate Arecibo on the moon by suspending an antenna from the lip of a crater and using the basin as a reflector. The reduced gravity on the moon would allow for a radio telescope far larger than any on Earth, which could significantly enhance the sensitivity of SETI searches. Ultimately the researchers concluded that a lunar radio observatory was too expensive compared to SETI telescopes that could be built on Earth.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But 40 years later, Michaud says that building a radio dish in a lunar crater may finally be cheap enough to pull off. One of the main drivers of this cost reduction is the advent of commercial launch providers like SpaceX and Rocket Lab, which have </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/cheaper-rockets-growing-the-human-family-in-space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dramatically lowered the cost of space access</a><span>. Another driver is NASA’s push to establish a permanent human presence on the moon, which has subsidized the development of a fleet of commercial lunar exploration vehicles. “There’s so much interest in going back to the moon,” says Michaud, who cited Blue Origin’s lunar lander and Rocket Lab’s Photon Lunar satellite as examples of technologies enabled by </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/nasas-first-puerto-rican-born-director-aims-for-a-moonshot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA’s Artemis program</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>A crux of the original vision for lunar SETI observatories was that it would require a human settlement on the moon to build and operate the radio dish. But robotic systems have improved enough that it may be possible to take humans out of the equation. This was clearly demonstrated in 2019 when China’s Chang’e 4 rover landed autonomously on the farside of the moon. These advancements in autonomous navigation have laid the foundation for a lunar radio observatory that is built entirely by robots.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>It sounds like science fiction, but earlier this year NASA’s Advanced Innovative Concepts program </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/lunar_crater_radio_telescope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">awarded one of it’s prestigious grants to Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to figure out a way to make it happen</a><span>. His idea is to use rovers to deploy wire mesh in a crater on the lunar farside and suspend a receiver over the dish. NIAC is all about funding high risk, high reward missions, and there’s no guarantee that Bandyopadhyay’s proposal will ever come to fruition. Still, addressing the technical problems associated with building a radio receiver on the farside of the moon is an important first step.</span></p></div><div><p><span>And Bandyopadhyay isn’t the only NASA-backed researcher contemplating a lunar radio observatory. Jack Burns, a radio astronomer at the University of Colorado, has also received a grant to study a mission concept for a radio telescope array called </span><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/project/lunar-farside/dr-jack-burns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FARSIDE</a><span>. Instead of using a crater as a dish, FARSIDE would deploy several smaller antennas across the lunar surface that would collectively form a large radio telescope. Both NASA studies are focused on radio astronomy rather than SETI, but Siemion sees the two disciplines as natural allies in the quest to establish an observatory on the lunar farside. SETI has piggybacked on other radio astronomy projects in the past—SERENDIP, for instance, opportunistically searched for ET signals during radio observation campaigns at a variety of telescopes—and it seems plausible that a similar arrangement could be made with an observatory on the moon.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Siemion acknowledged that there were certain technical challenges that would arise in a collaboration on a lunar radio observatory. The biggest issue, he says, is that a lot of radio astronomy is done at frequencies that don’t really require an observatory on the moon. “Radio …</span></p></div></div></div>

<h4 id="intro">0. Introduction </h4><p>During a recent trip to North Korea, I noticed the recent and ubiquitous presence of <em>Information Technology Exchange Rooms</em> (정보기술교류실), physical stores where one can purchase a variety of electronic devices – from laptops and tablets to USB sticks and chargers – as well as software and video games for PC, mobile and tablets (for an in-depth look at what goes on inside those stores as well as what the app selection looks like, <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2019/02/what-to-buy-inside-a-north-korean-app-store/">this article</a> by Alek Sigley provides a an excellent description. There are also a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ujblnigJmM">videos</a> on YouTube). After looking through the catalogue of available games at different stores, I eventually decided to try and buy a Sim City-like game called <em>City Management</em> (도시경경).</p>

The vendor connected the phone to his PC, transferred the APK and tried to install it, but to no avail. After multiple attempts, he eventually informed me that North Korean apps most likely could not run on phones from other countries. </p>

I got the <em>Morning</em> (아침) brand, which is geared towards students and quite affordable. The tablet ran Android 4 (Kit Kat) on an ARM cpu and came loaded with a few educational apps: language learning courses, dictionaries and several e-book libraries containing the complete works of Kim Il Sung, school textbooks and a collection of literary works. No games, but that could now be fixed quite easily.</p>

Unfortunately, after the game’s initial splash screen, I landed on this:</p>

There is a “request number” (요청번호) likely used to generate the licence key and make sure it can’t be shared with other devices. Unfortunately, since the APK never installed, the vendor did not put a licence file on my phone when I bought the app. My stay in North Korea was coming to an end too and I did not have time to go back to an app store to buy a new key. So I figured I would take a look inside the app and see if I could get it running nonetheless. </p>

<h4>1. Licensing system </h4><p>To start looking into the APK’s code, I’ll use the standard suite of tools to decompress, decompile and rebuild android apps: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/">dex2jar</a>, <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">jd-gui</a>, <a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/">apktool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/appium/sign">apksign</a>. I’ll also use <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> to run and debug the app. The fact that I couldn’t run the app on my phone may have just come from an Android version compatibility issue: I had no problem running it on an emulated Android 4.4 device with Android Studio. The decompilation of the <code>classes.dex</code> file gives us some interesting information right away:</p>
<figure id="attachment_438"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png" alt="" width="211" height="326"></a><figcaption>Packages and classes from the decompiled <code>classes.dex</code> file</figcaption></figure><p>The name of the <code>com.bz.cityisland2</code> package actually refers to the original game that <em>City Management</em> is based on: <a href="https://www.sparklingsociety.net/sparkling-games/city-building-games/city-island-2/">City Island 2</a> by the Dutch game studio Sparkling Society. The name of the package <code>com.smartions.appprotected</code> refers to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartions-ag#section-overview">Smartions</a>, a company that offers solutions to “monetize your mobile game or app in China” and are apparently also City Island’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_Society">distributor in China</a>. There are no mentions of those companies in the game itself however. The game’s loading splash screen only tells us that the game was made by the Ryusong (meteor) Technology Exchange Center (류성기술교류소) and that it is protected by the law for the protection of software (<a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/kisdi/common/premium?file=1%7C10360">콤퓨터쏘프트웨어보호법</a>). The law has been in place since 2003 to regulate the sales and distribution of software in the country and guarantees software developers the private ownership of their creation.</p>

In any case, the North Korean version does not use Smartions’s monetization system nor Sparkling Society’s but relies on a different system, which is the main difference from the original game. Save for the translation and some minor renames, the game is otherwise similar to the original (from a cursory examination) in its design, gameplay, features… to the original. </p>

The Unity code is stored in various library with the developer’s C# code being compiled to <code>Assembly-CSharp.dll</code>. C# compiled code is easily decompilable using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy">dnSpy</a>. Once the dll is decompiled, we can look for the message we got earlier “열쇠화일이 존재하지 않습니다” (“The key file does not exist”) to find the bits of code we are interested in. The string search takes us to the <code>CIGLoadingScreen</code> class where we find the string among other variables:</p>

			{
				Application.Quit();
			}
		}
	}
</pre><p>This is the code used to display the splashscreen we encountered earlier. If the boolean property <code>this.m_isVerify</code>, presumably the result of a call to a function checking the existence and validity of a licence key, is <code>False</code> then, the screen is displayed with the message we saw earlier and the “request number”. The verification function and the generation of the request number are handled in another class <code>GameCus</code>:</p>

  <h2><a href="https://blog.steve.fi/writing_an_assembler_.html">Writing an assembler.</a></h2>
  <p>3 October 2020 13:00</p>
  <div><p>Recently I've been writing a couple of simple compilers, which take input in a particular format and generate assembly language output.  This output can then be piped through <code>gcc</code> to generate a native executable.</p>

<p>Public examples include this trivial <a href="https://github.com/skx/math-compiler" rel="nofollow">math compiler</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/skx/bfcc" rel="nofollow">brainfuck compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Of course there's always the nagging thought that relying upon <code>gcc</code> (or <code>nasm</code>) is a bit of a cheat.  So I wondered how hard is it to write an assembler?  Something that would take assembly-language program and generate a native (ELF) binary?</p>

<p>And the answer is "It isn't hard, it is just tedious".</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/vishen/go-x64-executable/" rel="nofollow">some code</a> to generate an ELF binary, and after that assembling simple instructions was pretty simple.  I remember from my assembly-language days that the encoding of instructions can be pretty much handled by tables, but I've not yet gone into that.</p>

<p>(Specifically there are instructions like "<code>add rax, rcx</code>", and the encoding specifies the source/destination registers - with different forms for various sized immediates.)</p>

<p>Anyway I hacked up a simple assembler, it can compile <code>a.out</code> from this input:</p>

<pre><code>.hello   DB "Hello, world\n"
.goodbye DB "Goodbye, world\n"

        mov rdx, 13        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, hello     ;; starting at the string
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        int 0x80           ;; syscall

        mov rdx, 15        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, goodbye   ;; starting at the string
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        int 0x80           ;; syscall


        xor rbx, rbx       ;; exit-code is 0
        xor rax, rax       ;; syscall will be 1 - so set to xero, then increase
        inc rax            ;;
        int 0x80           ;; syscall
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious omission is support for "JMP", "JMP_NZ", etc.  That's painful because jumps are encoded with relative offsets.  For the moment if you want to jump:</p>

<pre><code>        push foo     ; "jmp foo" - indirectly.
        ret

:bar
        nop          ; Nothing happens
        mov rbx,33   ; first syscall argument: exit code
        mov rax,1    ; system call number (sys_exit)
        int 0x80     ; call kernel

:foo
        push bar     ; "jmp bar" - indirectly.
        ret
</code></pre>

<p>I'll update to add some more instructions, and see if I can use it to handle the output I generate from a couple of other tools.  If so that's a win, if not then it was a fun learning experience:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Sofware dysfunction is more often motivated by anxiety, fear, worry and embarassment than it is by a lack of technical skill. Engineers avoid work that needs doing because they’re afraid of becoming entangled with a nightmarish task, or because they’re afraid of looking stupid, or harming their career by spending time on grungy work. The task itself is rarely that difficult; it just seems so, which is enough of a barrier to discourage anyone from picking it up. One of the highest-leverage things you can do as an engineer is to recognize this emotional reaction in yourself and work to counter it. If you’re working on a single task, doing this can make your implementation significantly cleaner. If you’re a senior engineer with responsibility for a whole system, this can help you address high-impact architectural or operational issues.</p>
<p>You can see this in the common advice to sleep on a problem and come back to it in the morning. A bug that seems impossible when you’re tired and frustrated is far more approachable when you’re well-rested and caffeinated. Tedious investigative tasks (like scanning the logs for a bug or tracing all the possible code paths in a function) are still tedious in the morning, but infinitely more doable. You can knock it out in half an hour while drinking your morning coffee, rather than spending hours the night before avoiding the tedious work and hoping for a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>Necessary work avoided becomes a haunted forest in the codebase. One engineer’s avoidant emotions turn into dangerous team habits as engineers teach each other to avoid touching certain files, or to pass odd-looking production bugs to the operations team. “This network behaviour is dark magic, let them handle it!” What began as a single engineer’s worry is now a team’s dysfunction, and can eventually metastasize into actively blocking engineers from working on the original technical problems: if you’re avoiding working on a worrying problem, it can feel threatening when someone else comes along and tries to solve it. What if they succeed, or worse still succeed easily? That would reveal that you weren’t good enough to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Just because you’re touching a scary part of the system doesn’t mean you’re facing scary work calmly and rationally. Engineers often approach thorny work like they’re going through a haunted house: either trudging through with eyes half-closed, or rushing through at full speed trying to get out as quickly as possible. Both tactics aim to take in as little of the frightening environment as possible, and neither tactic is a good way of solving real problems in technical systems. If you’ve ever just tweaked setings or frantically moved code around until it worked, you’ve done this.</p>
<p>From the inside, this doesn’t feel like emotionally-driven avoidance. It feels like working on legacy code, sharing friendly complaints about it with other engineers on your team. This is in part because a fear of hard technical problems can be a rational fear. Untangling messy parts of the codebase, identifying and removing dead code, cleaning up build, deploy and monitoring systems - these tasks often feel overwhelming because they can overwhelm you, sucking up days for no real gain. It can harm your career to spend time on this work in an org that mainly values shipping features. (I haven’t seen the other common worry - looking stupid - really be an issue in practice myself.) The trouble comes when you don’t recognise that part of your response is emotional, and therefore overrate the actual difficulty or risk.</p>
<p>How can you distinguish a rational response to a too-difficult task from a learned emotional reaction to a task that is merely worrying? This is a hard problem. I think it is the hardest problem that almost all engineers will regularly face. One approach is to avoid trying to tell the difference at all, and allot a certain amount of time to looking at randomly-chosen neglected parts of the system. Things that reduce stress in general are also good ways to reduce stress and worry about work. Good sleep, eating well, exercise, therapy, and working in an emotionally safe team all have a significant positive effect on the quality of engineering work. Once you start doing this, the difference is usually obvious in hindsight: if the task that worried you for six months took an hour or two of work when you finally mustered up the effort to look at it, you know your worry was unfounded. Dealing with worry is a virtuous cycle. Each difficult task you do makes you less scared of the next one.</p>
<p>Tackling a series of worrying tasks is one of the quickest ways I know to have massive impact in your engineering org. This is because once you understand a thorny piece of code, or a neglected system, you will usually see how to make obvious improvements. In any other part of the system these improvements would have been made already, but since you are the first person to really wrap your head around it in a long time, you get to make them here! Occasionally, you will see the opportunity to completely remove the worrying part of the system, which for me is one of the most satisfying things you can do as a software engineer. Removing things that cause your team stress has compounding benefits to your team, to the systems you work on, and to your engineering org in general.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We decided to adopt Gatsby for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s customer-facing documentation</a> - well, I should say that <em>I</em> decided. We were already using it successfully for a variety of static marketing content, and I knew it had a lot of hype, so after a brief proof-of-concept it seemed like a safe choice.</p>
<p>To help contextualize everything I’m about to say, it’s important to understand the scope of our usage. Sentry’s documentation is not as straightforward as you might think - in fact, there are over 3,000 pages as of writing. We have a large amount of templated content designed to render language-specific examples, as well as a variety of different types of documentation (user guides, help desk-y articles, code-rich technical docs). Originally we had extended Jekyll to support a lot of this, but Ruby isn’t widely used at Sentry (approximately 0% of the engineering team knows Ruby), and it had become a big mess of spaghetti code with slow build times.</p>
<p>I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.</p>
<h2>Adopting Gatsby</h2>
<p>So, enter Gatsby. It seemed fast, was built on React (we’re experts on that here, with our gigabyte-sized Sentry frontend app), and had a huge adoption (assumed future existence and stability). While we didn’t have the desire to use MDX, it also seemed like a positive outcome given we could more easily deal with some of the rich aspects of our docs site, without having to resort to 2010-era JavaScript. We assumed a bunch of the other features of Gatsby had value-add, but we didn’t have an immediate need. These were things like dynamic source data - thus the need for a GraphQL engine at all - as well as the large plug-in ecosystem.</p>
<p>We started by iteratively converting sections of the Jekyll site into Gatsby - running them side by side for a time. At one point we eventually bulk converted pages, and ripped off the band aid. At this point though it was becoming clear build times were a problem. You’d spend at least 5 minutes on image optimization alone, with no way to even disable that. Slowly but surely we were depleting the ozone later on re-optimizing images which had already been pre-optimized. Oh yeah, and we were crippling our iteration speed as well, since the build cache would invalidate under a variety of situations in early development.</p>
<p>Making this worse was how we deployed Gatsby. We started off leveraging what we had already done: deploying Jekyll with Docker onto our own infrastructure - effectively just proxied via a CDN. We continued that for a period of time, but deploy times were far too long - upwards of 30-40 minutes for everything to build. Eventually we moved over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which dropped it down closer to 10 minutes, but ultimately it can’t fix what it doesn’t control.</p>
<p>The build and deploy times were the first of many woes, and they represent what would become a continued frustration: a problem without a clear solution.</p>
<h2>Enter MDX</h2>
<p>Rewind time a little bit - this actually wasn’t our first project converting documentation to Gatsby. The proof-of-concept I mentioned earlier was actually our <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">developer documentation</a>, which I had migrated out of Notion to make public. While doing that we had gotten our hands dirty with some initial MDX usability and extensions - like our code samples which support toggling between different languages. This was one of the many things we needed to solve for, but MDX made it look like it’d be seemingly easy. No more jQuery DOM manipulation, just clean, encapsulated React components. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we hit rough spots with MDX. We were coming from Jekyll - which was Liquid-rendered (a template engine) markdown - to MDX - a strange offspring of Markdown and JSX, attempting all of the benefits of both, but missing by a fairly large margin. Let’s illustrate the crux of the issue with what has got to be one of the most common needs in a documentation system: an alert (or callout) component:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>info<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>You should know something important about this!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At face value this looks great. <code>Alert</code> is just a React component, and JSX is close enough to HTML that non-technical folks are able to pick it up fairly easily. Now the problem comes into play when you actually want to do something in the real world. Here’s an example from our API docs:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would you expect this to render? Both as an engineer and a non-engineer, I would expect - given this is markdown - that the “PUT/DELETE” text would be bold. It’s not. Because the MDX interpreter decides that once you enter a component block, it’s no longer markdown. So instead, we’re forced with this monstrosity <em>everywhere</em> in our documentation:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s two things you should note here: 1) we have to use this <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag, 2) we have to put empty new-lines to ensure paragraph tags render.</p>
<p>“But David”, you might say, “why don’t you just tell the <code>Alert</code> component to render the text as markdown?“. If only you could, or at least, if only I could have possibly found a way to achieve that as a user with minimal Gatsby or MDX internals knowledge.</p>
<p>To Gatsby, or at least to the MDX team’s credit, they recognize some of these problems and <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1041">there is work underway</a> on a 2.0 of the MDX dialect. While I’m confident they will improve things, I’m not confident MDX can ultimately succeed. It’s likely going to tradeoff one problem for another due to what it’s trying to achieve in the first place. It may get to a good place, but frankly, we need to step back and look at what we’re trying to solve, instead of creating a solution to a problem we don’t have. I don’t need JSX syntax in my markdown, I need a way to include JSX components. That might sound similar, but its quite a different thing.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s no reason I couldn’t simply use markdown syntax, and provide a way to achieve something akin to:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a-valid-html-tag-because-markdown-allows-that</span> <span>a-valid-property</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>a-value<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This wouldn’t force us to work around quirks in a new language (or interpreter even), and could be solved in a much more sustainable way. There are other alternatives as well. A generic way to render extensions in markdown could simply call into a React component, and avoid even trying to hijack HTML in the first place. While I don’t know what this might look like in Markdown, in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">Sphinx’s use of reStructuredText</a> this was solved early on with Directives:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.. my-directive:: some data
   :property-name: property-value</code></pre></div>
<p>I will hold out for MDX 2.0 and hope that finds a nice minimal-compromise place, but if not, we’ll be looking for a way to extend native markdown.</p>
<h2>A Broken DOM</h2>
<p>While we were able to work around the kinks of MDX, there’s been some things not yet solved. One of those is the layer which Gatsby uses to apply diffs to the DOM. I’m going to caveat this section with <em>I don’t know what the technical implementation is</em>, but I can make some assumptions given what I know of the domain. The system itself is intended to apply deltas to the DOM. This is naively also how React works, and I imagine under the hood it’s relying on React at least for part of it. We’ve had issues with this identified in two places already:</p>
<ul>
<li>progressive image loading</li>
<li>dynamic JSX components</li>
</ul>
<p>While they might not be linked to the same issue, they smell like they are, so we’re going to roll with it. The problem exhibits itself when you have a bunch of DOM that to a naive robot might look the same:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;baz&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobizbar&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In React it uses the graph to identify which node is which - effectively creating a unique entity ID based on its location. In cases where that’s difficult, React will warn you to explicitly bind a <code>key</code> attribute on each element to ensure it can more accurately deal with updates. While I would assume Gatsby is at least partially using React’s DOM engine, what we see in production effectively takes the above example, and replaces some of the content with other subsets of content - meaning it’s unable to accurately identify which nodes need updated.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this where a progressive image is replaced with an entirely different image that’s present near it on the page. We’ve also seen this happen for a dynamically loaded section of content (our language-selector include tags). While we’ve yet to identify a fix for the image tags, our other issue was resolved by literally changing a <code>div</code> tag to a different tag, one which is less commonly used (in our case, <code>section</code>).</p>
<p>All of the cases happen after Gatsby’s initial static render and exist only when applying some form of delta.</p>
<h2>Let’s Talk GraphQL</h2>
<p>It’s a static website generator. It literally does not need GraphQL all over the place. While there are few instances in the real world where that is valuable, it shouldn’t require a GraphQL API to read objects that are already in memory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend the energy to hammer this in, but take a look at Jared Palmer’s <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs">Gatsby vs. Next.js</a> as it echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, let’s actually not talk about GraphQL, but all its done is create complexity for us.</p>
<h2>Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>There’s a number of other things we’ve found fairly frustrating at this point, but this post is already getting long, so I’m choosing to summarize them.</p></section></div>

    <section>
      <p>When the engineering managers I coach struggle to find ambitious goals, I sometimes leverage their ambitions to help them identify areas where they can improve. But, to my surprise, not so many EMs have ambitions beyond their current role.</p><p>When I had a “real job”, I was always driven by the next thing. I didn’t care about the title, but I always wanted more impact and responsibilities (in six years and two companies, I had seven different positions 😅). While I don’t recommend being as “opportunistic” as I was (but hey, I ended up being an entrepreneur), I do believe that thinking about the next position gives you <strong>perspective and makes you more in control of your career</strong>. But the difference between thinking about your next promotion and getting it is enormous. </p><p>Many engineers believe that if you do great work at your job, people will recognise that work and automatically give you an adequate promotion or raise. It is unfortunately far from reality, as <strong>those who get promoted, are not the best employees, but the more visible</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dilbert.com</figcaption></figure><h3 id="visibility-matters"><strong>Visibility matters</strong></h3><p>Think about your CTO’s typical day (or the VP Engineering, the one who will eventually decide on your promotion). They might have eight to ten meetings to attend, tens of emails (or Slack messages) to answer and they always have to switch their mind to a different project or a new problem that needs to be solved. So, unless you’re involved in the problem du jour, the number of seconds the CTO is thinking about you in a day is about zero. Pretty normal right? The CTO is a busy gal and can’t think about every single team member. But if you’re serious about this promotion, <strong>she should hear about you often</strong>. </p><p>In an <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/katie-sylor-miller">interview with StaffEng</a>, Katie Sylor-Miller, a Frontend Architect at Etsy, says that “<em>a big part of being promoted [...] is making sure that your work is visible, that people know your name and you have a good reputation.</em>” I’m sure you’re thinking right now about OKRs, performance reviews, one-on-one(s) with your boss and all the other mechanisms in place at your company to make your work visible. Unfortunately, as rightly pointed out by <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">Slava Akhmechet</a>, a product manager at Stripe, they’re too often <strong>“social fiction”</strong>:</p><blockquote><em>Following the overt mechanisms of advancement is neither sufficient nor necessary. It may even be actively harmful - almost everyone who does great work and takes performance reviews seriously toils in relative obscurity. Look at the people who occupy positions of considerable authority in your organisation. Did any of them get there by following some middle manager's feedback?</em></blockquote><p>Instead of social fiction, I think the word “game” is more appropriate for the advancement system in most companies (and any human interactions by the way). Since I’m pretty sure you’ve spent countless hours like me playing video games (or still do 🎮), how do you win at video games? <strong>You game the system</strong>.</p><h3 id="understand-the-promotion-process-at-your-company"><strong>Understand the promotion process at your company</strong></h3><p>If you’re currently an engineering manager, any promotion from now on will make you part of your company’s leadership team. And, as pointed out by <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/">Will Larson</a>, “<em>existing members of that team want to be comfortable that they’re expanding their ranks with folks they believe in, and they can’t believe in you if they don’t know you.</em>”</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 1240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>FangXianUo/iStock</figcaption></figure><p>As an engineering manager, you’re not contributing anymore to the codebase. You’re<strong> contributing to the company’s success</strong>. Managing your team is the means to get there, not the goal. More specifically, an engineering manager contributes to the company’s success by:</p><p><strong>1/ Attracting and retaining the very best engineers</strong>: like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I firmly believe that an organisation “<em>where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness.</em>” So even if there is a process in place to attract engineers, everyone in the company will thank you if you managed to score a high-profile recruit (while saving thousands in headhunter’s fees). Some tips for doing so:</p><ul><li><strong>Be recognised externally as an expert</strong> and someone great engineers would want to work with (blogging, speaking…)</li><li><strong>Continuously look for talent</strong>, especially visible ones (the ones who blog, speak, live code, contribute to open source…) and invite them for informal interviews</li><li><strong>Mentor external engineers</strong> pro-bono, even if they don’t end working for you, they sometimes have friends who might</li></ul><p><strong>2/ Shipping revenue-generating projects</strong>: for any company out there, technology is just the means to make more money. So which projects in your company right now have the highest revenue-generating potential? There are usually three or four such projects per year, so you need to make sure your team is involved in these projects, even if it means <strong>being proactive about it and not waiting for your manager to assign it to you</strong>. When I was an employee, I used to regularly crash meetings (or discussions at the coffee counter) and see if I could be useful to a project.</p><p><strong>3/ Proactively solving problems:</strong> I’m sure you’re the kind of person who always presents problems with a solution. What’s even better is for you to <strong>start solving the problem before your boss is even aware of it</strong>. CTOs have to make countless decisions every day, and they need to know they can count on leaders in their team to be proactive and make the right decisions for them. Obviously, this action shouldn't say hidden and you would have sent a message to the leadership with information about the problem, what your team is doing to solve it and a deadline.</p><h3 id="building-your-promotion-playbook">Building your promotion playbook</h3><p>When I was advising startups on fundraising, most of the work we were doing was building up a great story that would unroll during the roadshow (3 to 6 months). Getting promoted is not the same as fundraising, but the mechanism is similar:</p><p><strong>1/ Make your intentions known</strong>: promotion is a two-way street, and your management should be aware of your objectives, as well as you should be aware of what they’re expecting from someone who does your targeted job. Ideally, they should state clearly what you should be demonstrating to get the job so that you can show you’ve done it when the time is right.</p><p><strong>2/ Keep a log of your achievements and impact:</strong> start a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> or a <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> that will be the base for any communication about your team’s accomplishments (especially the ones on high-impact projects).</p><p><strong>3/ Make it impossible for them to say no</strong>: when it’s promotion or review time, build a short presentation that shows factually how you achieved what the management expected of you and your team’s successes.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>the higher you go on the management ladder, the fewer positions are available</strong>. Sometimes you might want to make a lateral move at a smaller company to build up more responsibilities (like becoming CTO or VPE at a startup) before going back to a more mature company.</p><p>Last but not least, it’s essential to understand that while thinking about your next promotion should not be your main focus, <strong>it is part of your job</strong>. There are still way too many opportunistic leaders in technology organisations and not enough people like you. So please do me a favour, keep doing a great job AND get that promotion instead of all the opportunistic contenders 😉</p><hr><h3 id="news"><strong>News</strong></h3><p><em>This section is only available to email subscribers. <a href="https://www.tlt21.com/signup/">Sign up</a>, it's free!</em></p><hr><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>Thinking about getting promoted gives you perspective and makes you more in control of your career</li><li>Those who get promoted are not the best employees, but the more visible</li><li>To be more visible: attract high-level engineers, ship revenue-generating projects, proactively solve problems</li><li>Getting promoted is a 6-month process that resembles a fundraising roadshow</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[RESOURCE] <a href="https://progression.monzo.com/techops"><strong>Progression at Monzo</strong></a> - Monzo</p><p>[ESSAY] <strong><a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a> </strong>- Slava Akhmechet</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/"><strong>Software Developer Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level</strong></a> - Gergely Orosz</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/"><strong>Being visible</strong></a> - Will Larson</p>

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

<p>This document is a set of guidelines for using C++ well.
The aim of this document is to help people to use modern C++ effectively.
By “modern C++” we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++17, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++14 and C++11).
In other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years’ time, given that you can start now? In 10 years’ time?</p>

<p>The guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency.
Such rules affect application architecture and library design.
Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today.
And it will run fast – you can afford to do things right.</p>

<p>We are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style.
However, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Our initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity.
They may very well be too strict.
We expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs.
We also need more rules.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience.
If we haven’t suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed!
Please try to verify or disprove rules!
In particular, we’d really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial.
Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool.
Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.
We do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.
One way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.</p>

<p>The rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base.
We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.</p>

<p>Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.
We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the language and the set of available libraries improve.</p>



<p>This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.
The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.</p>

<h2 id="intarget-target-readership"><a name="SS-readers"></a>In.target: Target readership</h2>

<p>All C++ programmers. This includes <a href="#S-cpl">programmers who might consider C</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inaims-aims"><a name="SS-aims"></a>In.aims: Aims</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to help developers to adopt modern C++ (currently C++17) and to achieve a more uniform style across code bases.</p>

<p>We do not suffer the delusion that every one of these rules can be effectively applied to every code base. Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development.
As far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (“what you don’t use, you don’t pay for” or “when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs”).
Consider these rules ideals for new code, opportunities to exploit when working on older code, and try to approximate these ideals as closely as feasible.
Remember:</p>

<p>Take the time to understand the implications of a guideline rule on your program.</p>

<p>These guidelines are designed according to the “subset of superset” principle (<a href="#Stroustrup05">Stroustrup05</a>).
They do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever).
Instead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple “extensions” (<a href="#S-gsl">library components</a>)
that make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).</p>

<p>The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety.
For that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).
Partly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are prescriptive.
We are uncomfortable with rules that simply state “don’t do that!” without offering an alternative.
One consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks.
Other rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.</p>

<p>These guidelines address the core of C++ and its use.
We expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support.
For example, hard-real-time programmers typically can’t use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries.
We encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines.
Build your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.</p>

<p>The rules are designed to allow <a href="#S-modernizing">gradual adoption</a>.</p>

<p>Some rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both.
The guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++.
However, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source …</p></div></div>
