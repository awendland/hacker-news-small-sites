          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

        <p>
          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.
          </p>
          <p><cite>
            —&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">Git Internals</a>
          </cite></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Everybody claims to be a software company these days. From the nearly decade old pronouncement by Marc Andressen that <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">“Software Is Eating the World”</a> to the push from Wall Street to produce recurring software revenue; the pressure is on to claim - at least - that you are a software company. <br></p><p>This is obviously problematic for appliance vendors. Try as they might, it does not take much inspection to determine which ones have become truly software defined, and which ones are hoping to use financial engineering to fake it until they get there. <br></p><p>Either way, the ongoing debate about which is better, software defined storage or hardware storage appliances. Is pretty much over. <br></p><p>Like Marc predicted, software won. <br></p><p>We need to start with a clear definition of software defined storage. First of all, it is software. It most likely started as software too - it wasn’t “extracted” from a proprietary hardware platform. <br></p><p>Software defined storage should run on multiple customer servers with direct access storage (DAS) SSDs or disk drives or JBoDs (just a bunch of disks) or JBoF (just a bunch of flash) shelves that are SAS/NVMe attached to the servers. <br></p><p>True software defined storage doesn’t run on a narrow list of pre-approved boxes - that is just hardware defined storage with choices. Software defined storage should run on almost anything. For example a <a href="https://github.com/christianbaun/ossperf/wiki/Minio-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-3-with-Raspbian-(Debian-Jessie-8.0)">Raspberry Pi</a>. Or <a href="https://min.io/resources/docs/MinIO-POWER-whitepaper-HR.pdf">IBM Power9 infrastructure</a>. Or anything <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware">in-between</a>.<br></p><p>Hardware defined storage (appliances) combine server and storage hardware and software into one packaged solution that a customer buys whole from that vendor. Hardware defined storage is normally deployed by vendor personnel and can take the form of rackable hardware with vendor covers but underneath, is typically two or more servers with SAS or NVMe storage shelves attached. Hardware defined storage vendors provide the internal networking to connect the multiple servers and storage together. The appliance vendor personnel are responsible for servicing the appliance server and storage hardware as well as the storage software. <br></p><p>Let’s break it down further shall we?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Software Defined</th>
<th>Hardware Defined/Appliance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Superior. The customer supplies <br>their own servers &amp; storage <br>designed for the price/performance <br>configuration the deployment <br>calls for.</td>
<td>Worse. The storage vendor supplies <br>all of the hardware,<br>software and service for <br>the solution. Difficult to unbundle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Dependent on what is provisioned. <br>True high performance SDS on <br>fast HW and a fast network <br>outperforms even the “fast” <br>appliance vendors. This trend<br>will only continue. To be sure, <br>there will be niche cases <br>- but fast software is the <br>starting point.</td>
<td>Vendors optimize hardware and <br>software to get the most <br>performance and availability <br>out of the system. Price/Performance <br>curves are pretty linear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scalability</td>
<td>Better, as these are deployed <br>as a storage cluster, they <br>can often range from 3-4 nodes<br>to 100s of nodes and anything<br>in between.</td>
<td>Worse. Appliances typically come <br>with dual (server) controllers<br>and can typically scale up<br>to 4 of these (8 servers) <br>but generally not much higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fault <br>tolerance</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>treats failure as a normal event. <br>Done well, clusters seamlessly <br>redirect, heal or recover. <br>Sophisticated erasure-coding <br>and bitrot protection are software<br>inventions - and ensure manageability is <br>prioritized.</td>
<td>Appliances are generally optimized<br>for providing high levels of<br>fault tolerance. They are <br>typically deployed with dual <br>controllers that quickly failover <br>when one dies and provide <br>sophisticated storage protection <br>policies. Replacing the appliance <br>is not the same, however, as <br>replacing COTS hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automation</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API driven. These APIs typically <br>support most DevOps and <br>infrastructure automation and <br>monitoring packages currently <br>deployed in a data center.</td>
<td>Appliances generally support a <br>GUI first and APIs as second-class<br>citizens, if at all. This limits <br>automation and application failure <br>management. It is why most appliances<br>are only used for archival and not <br>modern apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration <br>flexibility</td>
<td>Customers deploy these solutions <br>on whatever performance and <br>capacity they want (within HCLs). <br>The configuration flexibility is <br>nearly infinite - critical when <br>considering the modern range <br>(data center to edge).</td>
<td>Appliances typically limit options <br>to very specific offerings, <br>generally 3-5 models are available <br>with DRAM &amp; capacity limits for <br>each model. Performance is often <br>limited by the appliance model <br>selected. Mixing and matching <br>models is a no-no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trialability</td>
<td>Want to try out software <br>defined storage - download it <br>and get started. If your <br>provider is truly open source<br>- what you are playing with <br>is the same software their <br>best customers run.</td>
<td>Appliances must be made available <br>to the customer on their data <br>center premises or at some other <br>test facility to be tried out. <br>Massive friction in the sales process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upgradeability</td>
<td>Customers can switch out <br>current servers or storage <br>with better ones anytime <br>they want and do <br>this themselves.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors generally <br>offer only specific model <br>upgrades to appliances which <br>have to be purchased and <br>are typically done by vendor <br>personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of installation</td>
<td>Better. As customers add <br>server or storage hardware <br>and deploy software on servers <br>all the time, they <br>can deploy software defined <br>storage on current or new servers <br>anytime they want.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors personnel are <br>typically used to deploy the <br>appliances. This may require <br>cross scheduling of data center <br>and vendor service personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of operations</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API first, but also supports <br>GUIs and/or are integrated <br>into larger solution interfaces <br>(think MinIO + Cisco).</td>
<td>Application vendors have invested <br>heavily in their GUI’s and <br>they are typically fully featured. <br>A good GUI can be a powerful form<br>of lock-in with IT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature <br>update frequency</td>
<td>True software defined storage <br>releases continuously. Often weekly. <br>Customers consume those on <br>demand. This means more features, <br>better security and less disruption.</td>
<td>Worse. Due to their tight <br>performance and availability <br>optimizations, testing must often <br>be more stringent and take <br>longer. This lengthens the interval <br>between feature <br>updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Footprint <br>density</td>
<td>Density traditionally favored appliances <br>- but with boxes like this, <br>that gap has been eliminated.</td>
<td>Appliances control the hardware, <br>and target the densest storage<br>shelves available - even if that<br>requires proprietary hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hardware <br>reuseability</td>
<td>Customers can take server and storage <br>hardware out of the cluster anytime <br>they wish and deploy this <br>for other uses. Licensing <br>terms may or may not need <br>to be changed. Server maintenance <br>options are at the discretion <br>of the customer and their <br>server vendor.</td>
<td>Other than using older appliances <br>as slower storage (aka boat anchors) <br>there’s not much that can be done <br>with it. However, to continue <br>to  use appliances as (slower) <br>storage , vendor maintenance contracts <br>will need to be maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Complexity</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>abstracts complexity. Great software <br>defined storage eliminates it.</td>
<td>A rare bright spot for appliance <br>vendors, the lack of flexibility <br>drives homogeneity and therefore <br>some semblance of simplicity. <br>It is why IT can be fiercely loyal<br>to their vendors.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Ultimately, there is a place for both solutions in the market today but the world is changing. <br></p><p>It burns a lot of cash to run a hardware appliance business. It ties up capital, requires large field sales and field sales support. Appliances are not built for the world we live in today. Further, as we have most famously pointed out - you <a href="https://blog.min.io/high-performance-object-storage-with-kubernetes/">can’t containerize an appliance</a>. Given that Kubernetes is the new normal - it is going to be increasingly difficult to make a living slinging steel. <br></p><p>That is why everyone is eager to say they are a “software-company” these days. Truth is, if their website is adorned with boxes showcasing their logo - it is not a software company. When they tweet a win and show some boxes, that is what they sold - not software. Just because for 45 mins every three months they say words like “revenue from software subscriptions” doesn’t mean they are a software company - it means they are on their quarterly analyst call. <br></p><p>So think about what you really want to achieve. If you want high-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage - choose software. If you want modern application support in addition to archival - choose software. If you want flexibility to design to your use case - choose software. <br></p><p>Don’t, however, choose hardware masquerading as software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Even before the pandemic, there were a few companies choosing to work shorter weeks. In Japan, Microsoft gave it a try in later part of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> and found that doing so increased productivity, reduced stress, and lessened employee burnout. It also had the added benefit of lowering operating costs for that month.</p><p>With COVID-19, average work environments have become even more stressful. Places like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/24/will-coronavirus-pandemic-open-door-four-day-workweek/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a> are acknowledging that there is no "one size fits all" solution to helping companies recover or thrive through the global pandemic.</p><p>What would happen if your company decided to run fewer days per week? Would you discover the same benefits as other companies? To answer this question for yourself, you will have to test the theory in your own company. However, to help you, we have looked to find out how other companies are dealing with COVID-19 and what they have gained from switching to a <a href="https://30hourjobs.com/4-day-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-day work week</a>.</p><h2 id="buffer">Buffer</h2><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/4-day-workweek-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a> became a company that chose to experiment for a single month. Their goal was to reduce the stress that employees and teammates were dealing with because of the global crisis. In June, the company decided to continue their May experiment to last the rest of 2020.</p><p>Why the change from "experiment" to full-time? The answer to this is in the feedback provided by their teammates. It seems unanimous that everyone experienced lower stress levels, increased work happiness, and less burnout. Employees worked more efficiently and effectively in their four days because of how relaxed they felt.</p><p>Although it is only something they are trying for the rest of the year, there is hope that it will continue to prove such an undeniable success.</p><h2 id="elephant-ventures">Elephant Ventures</h2><p><a href="https://www.elephantventures.com/4-day-work-week-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephant Ventures</a> has been doing 4-day work weeks in the Philippines for the past five years. They have noticed that across the board there is an increase in productivity because workers feel it balances out the work-life scenarios that we all have to face in the workforce.</p><p>In early June, the company closed its doors on their brick and mortar offices in the US. At the time, there was reasonable certainty that the doors would remain closed. However, in August, they decided that this was not what they truly wanted and began trying to come up with a way to meet the needs of clients in the "post Covid-19" world and take tips from their Philippines offices.</p><p>It is a little too soon to tell whether it is an absolute success or not. This does not mean that there isn't a hope that clients and employees will all be happy working this shorter workweek.</p><h2 id="shopify">Shopify</h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/remote-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify's</a> employees have embraced the remote/in-office way of working for years. However, in March 2020, they closed the door and went fully remote in an effort to "flatten the curve". The fact that they are working in a digital space by default, has made the transition much easier for them than traditional brick and mortar businesses. They already understand that eliminating bad work habits and strengthening healthier ones is beneficial to everyone.</p><p>In June, Shopify once again changed things up and announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/postcarl/status/1272676581165727746" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> that they would reserve Friday as the day for R&amp;R. Their goal at the time was to enjoy the shorter work week through August. It remains to be seen whether it is extended or not.</p><h2 id="shake-shack">Shake Shack</h2><p>For more than a year, Shake Shack has been <a href="https://www.wabe.org/enjoy-the-extra-day-off-more-bosses-give-4-day-workweek-a-try/" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing</a> the theory of shorter work weeks makes for happier employees. It began with a test run in Las Vegas to give managers an extra day off from work each week, while providing them with the typical 40-hour work week benefits. This means the same pay for fewer hours. With the success of it, the gradually spread out the "testing phase" to include more locations.</p><p>Their findings over the last year, is that employees, especially moms, appreciate working a shorter week because it gives them an extra day to spend with their families. This makes them feel better about being at work, because they do not miss out on taking kids to school, running errands on their day off, and more.</p><p>As the pandemic took hold of the US and all other areas of the globe, <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shake Shack</a> did what it could to care for its employees. They still strive to do what they can for the communities that they are a part of.</p><h2 id="radioactive-public-relations">Radioactive Public Relations</h2><p>In June 2019, <a href="https://www.radioactivepr.com/agency-impact-1-year-4-day-pay-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radioactive Public Relations</a> reached their one-year benchmark for working shorter work weeks. They were one of the first companies in the UK to give shorter weeks a try and quickly decided to extend their "test" phase.</p><p>Why was the test phase extended? The answer to this is simple. Employees were taking fewer sick days, recruitment was on the rise, business was growing, and employees were happier across the board. The employee happiness reasoning has ranged from enjoying the time with their families to doing things that they wouldn't be able to do if they worked a traditional work week.</p><h2 id="perpetual-guardian">Perpetual Guardian</h2><p>This New Zealand-based company was one of the first to jump on board with shorter work weeks. Andrew Barnes, founder of <a href="https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/the-four-day-week-is-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perpetual Guardian</a>, began testing the water with it in 2018. Since then, they have discovered that it encourages employees to work harder while encouraging staff members to organize their time more efficiently while at work.</p><p>Overall, it has lowered the stress level of all who work within the company by allowing them to have more of a life outside the office. Employees can now use their time to take up hobbies, spend time with loved ones, return to school for extra studies, and much more.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about balancing your work/life schedule or want to know more about transitioning to a shorter work week, we are here for you. You can contact us, join our newsletter, and more. Our goal at <a href="https://jobs.30hourjobs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 Hour Jobs</a> is to ensure everyone works the way they want to work.</p>

          <h2>Eliminating Task Processing Outages by Replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka Without Downtime</h2>

          <p><span>Scaling backend infrastructure to handle hyper-growth is one of the many exciting challenges of working at DoorDash. In mid 2019, we faced significant scaling challenges and frequent outages involving </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery_(software)"><span>Celery</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"><span>RabbitMQ</span></a><span>, two technologies powering the system that handles the asynchronous work enabling critical functionalities of our platform, including order checkout and Dasher assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We quickly solved this problem with a simple, </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"><span>Apache Kafka</span></a><span>-based asynchronous task processing system that stopped our outages while we continued to iterate on a robust solution. Our initial version implemented the smallest set of features needed to accommodate a large portion of existing Celery tasks. Once in production, we continued to add support for more Celery features while addressing novel problems that arose when using Kafka. </span></p>
<h2><span>The problems we faced using Celery and RabbitMQ</span></h2>
<p><span>RabbitMQ and Celery were mission critical pieces of our infrastructure that powered over 900 different asynchronous tasks at DoorDash, including order checkout, merchant order transmission, and Dasher location processing. The problem DoorDash faced was that RabbitMQ was frequently going down due to excessive load. If task processing went down, DoorDash effectively went down and orders could not be completed, resulting in revenue loss for our merchants and Dashers, and a poor experience for our consumers. We faced issues on the following fronts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability:</b><span> Outages caused by demand reduced availability.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b><span> RabbitMQ could not scale with the growth of our business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Observability:</b><span> RabbitMQ offered limited metrics and Celery workers were opaque.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Operational efficiency:</b><span> Restarting these components was a time-consuming, manual process.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Why our asynchronous task processing system wasn’t highly available</span></h3>
<p><span>This biggest problem we faced were outages, and they often came when demand was at its peak. RabbitMQ would go down due to load, </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#high-connection-churn"><span>excessive connection churn</span></a><span>, and other reasons. Orders would be halted, and we’d have to restart our system or sometimes even bring up an entirely new broker and manually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"><span>failover</span></a><span> in order to recover from the outage.</span></p>
<p><span>On diving deeper into the availability issues, we found the following sub-issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Celery allows users to schedule tasks in the future with a countdown or ETA. Our heavy use of&nbsp; these countdowns resulted in noticeable load increases on the broker. Some of our outages were directly related to an increase in tasks with countdowns. We ultimately decided to restrict the use of countdowns in favor of another system we had in place for scheduling work in the future.</span></li>
<li><span>Sudden bursts of traffic would leave RabbitMQ in a degraded state where task consumption was significantly lower than expected. In our experience, this could only be resolved with a RabbitMQ bounce. RabbitMQ has a concept of Flow Control where it will reduce the speed of connections which are publishing too quickly so that queues can keep up. Flow Control was often, but not always, involved in these availability degradations. When Flow Control kicks in, the publishers effectively see it as network latency. Network latency reduces our response times; if latency increases during peak traffic, significant slowdowns can result that cascade as requests pile up upstream.</span></li>
<li><span>Our python </span><a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span>uWSGI</span></a><span> web workers had a feature called harakiri that was enabled to kill any processes that exceeded a timeout. During outages or slowdowns, harakiri resulted in a connection churn to the RabbitMQ brokers as processes were repeatedly killed and restarted. With thousands of web workers running at any given time, any slowness that triggered harakiri would in turn contribute even more to slowness by adding extra load to RabbitMQ.</span></li>
<li><span>In production we experienced several cases where task processing in the Celery consumers&nbsp; stopped, even in the absence of significant load. Our investigation efforts did not yield evidence of any resource constraints that would’ve halted processing, and the workers resumed processing once they were bounced. This problem was never root caused, though we suspect an issue in the Celery workers themselves and not RabbitMQ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, all of these availability issues were unacceptable for us as high reliability is one of our highest priorities. Since these outages were costing us a lot in terms of missed orders and credibility we needed a solution that would address these problems as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why our legacy solution did not scale&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The next biggest problem was scale. DoorDash is growing fast and we were quickly reaching the limits of our existing solution. We needed to find something that would keep up with our continued growth since our legacy solution had the following problems:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Hitting the vertical scaling limit</strong></p>
<p><span>We were using the largest available single-node RabbitMQ solution that was available to us. There was no path to scale vertically any further and we were already starting to push that node to its limits.</span></p>
<p><strong>The High Availability mode limited our capacity&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Due to replication, the primary-secondary High Availability (HA) mode reduced throughput compared to the single node option, leaving us with even less headroom than just the single node solution. We could not afford to trade throughput for availability.</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the primary-secondary HA mode did not, in practice, reduce the severity of our outages. Failovers took more than 20&nbsp; minutes&nbsp; to complete and would often get stuck requiring manual intervention. Messages were often lost in the process as well.</span></p>
<p><span>We were quickly running out of headroom as DoorDash continued to grow and push our task processing to its limits. We needed a solution that could scale horizontally as our processing needs grew.</span></p>
<h3><span>How Celery and RabbitMQ offered limited observability</span></h3>
<p><span>Knowing what’s going on in any system is fundamental to ensuring its availability, scalability, and operational integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we navigated the issues outlined above, we noticed that :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We were limited to a small set of RabbitMQ metrics available to us.</span></li>
<li><span>We had limited visibility into the Celery workers themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We needed to be able to see real-time metrics of every aspect of our system which meant the observability limitations needed to be addressed as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The operational efficiency challenges</span></h3>
<p><span>We also faced several issues with operating RabbitMQ:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We often had to failover our RabbitMQ node to a new one to resolve the persistent degradation we observed. This operation was manual and time consuming for the engineers involved and often had to be done late at night, outside of peak times.</span></li>
<li><span>There were no in-house Celery or RabbitMQ experts at DoorDash who we could lean on to help devise a scaling strategy for this technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Engineering time spent operating and maintaining RabbitMQ was not sustainable. We needed something that better met our current and future needs.</span></p>
<h2><span>Potential solutions to our problems with Celery and RabbitMQ&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>With the problems outlined above, we considered the following solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Celery broker from RabbitMQ to Redis or Kafka. </b>This would allow us to continue using Celery, with a different and potentially more reliable backing datastore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Add multi-broker support to our </b><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a><b> app so consumers could publish to N different brokers based on whatever logic we wanted. </b>Task processing will get sharded across multiple brokers, so each broker will experience a fraction of the initial load.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade to newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ. </b>Newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ were expected to fix reliability issues, buying us time as we were already extracting components from our Django monolith in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Migrate to a custom solution backed by Kafka. </b>This solution takes more effort than the other options we listed, but also has more potential to solve every problem we were having with the legacy solution.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered: “What if clicking on a hyperlink could transport me — not just the screen in front of me — to a new location?”</p><p>That’s what the founders of Uber wondered. So, they transformed an ordinary link into a request for a ride.</p><p>This is called “hacking hypertext”.</p><p>Imagine, a link—a button, a menu, a search result—being able to accomplish something in the real world with a single click.</p><p>Google is a great example of this. They hacked hypertext in two ways: 1) They realized a hyperlink to a page meant that page is more valuable and 2) They gave everyone access to the most valuable links with the click of a Search button.</p><p>Facebook took hyperlinks to the next level by making them represent people and their relationships. Events, messages, profile pages, relationship statuses — all available with a click.</p><p>Who else has hacked hypertext?</p><ul><li>Amazon has 1-Click ordering that makes products show up at your door</li><li>Airbnb lets you rent apartments around the world with a click</li><li>Netflix makes thousands of tv shows and movies accessible with a single click</li></ul><p>These companies transform the good ol’ hyperlink into something incredibly powerful. </p><p>For most of us, though, links are still just plain, boring links.</p><p>As an ordinary person on the internet, I can’t create a link out of thin air that will show a list of my upcoming events or let someone rent my apartment — I rely on Facebook and Airbnb to create these kinds of links. </p><p>So, the question is: <em>why isn’t hypertext more powerful by default?</em></p><p>The answer is: it’s wildly expensive to transform an ordinary hyperlink into something more.</p><p>Big companies like Google and Facebook spend billions of dollars a year building the infrastructure and hiring the talent necessary to support their hypertext hacks.</p><p>Usually, the most an ordinary citizen of the internet can do is use a hyperlink to link to their social media profile or personal website.</p><p>But... what if someone decided to democratize the incredible power these big companies have to hack hypertext?</p><p>What if anyone could hack hypertext?</p><p>More and more companies are buying into the “Low-Code” movement. Companies like Stripe, Webflow, and Shopify are making it easier to create online businesses. And companies like Airtable, Bubble, and Glide are making it possible for ordinary people to build powerful experiences using a set of hypertext hacks they invented.</p><p>But the foundation is still lacking. Hypertext itself hasn’t changed that much in the past three decades. It’s still, by default, pretty weak. It’s meant to create links between pages, not links to real-world actions.</p><p>I believe there’s a stage after “Low-Code”, a kind of hypertext 2.0. Maybe it comes with virtual reality, or cryptocurrency — or maybe it’s born when someone creates a new type of web browser. I don’t know. But, when it comes, it’s going to let anyone have the power to reshape the real world with a good ol’ hyperlink.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>How does QuestDB get the kind of performance it does, and how are we continuing
to squeeze another 50-60% out of it? We are constantly learning more about the
fundamental concepts of memory performance, and this is one example of how what
we at first thought would be <em>worse</em> for performance ended up bringing us a
rather substantial boost in overall memory performance.</p><p>We will walk you through how some of our initial thoughts on storage and
memory-mapping evolved to bring us better performance overall.</p><p>If you like QuestDB, please do give us a star on
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p><h2>How the performance improvements started</h2><p>QuestDB started out with a single-threaded approach to queries and such. But one
obvious way to improve performance in a Java application like this is to
parallelize as much as you can by using multiple threads of execution.</p><p>I've written multi-threaded applications, and they are not easy to do. It's hard
to coordinate the work between multiple threads, and to make sure that there are
no race conditions, collisions, etc.</p><h2>Storage performance</h2><p>So first it's important to understand that QuestDB stores it's data in columnar
format. We store each column of data in a file. So for every column of data,
there is a file.</p><p>We then split those columns up into data frames that are independent and can be
computed completely independently of each other.</p><p>The problem we encountered with this framing scheme was that it was impossible
to frame variable length data. Data spilled out of the frame, making it
difficult to manage.</p><p>You see, we store fixed length fields with fixed length values, such that
aligning frames to 8 bytes would ensure that all our fixed length data does not
straddle frames. Hence all the columns are the same frame width. But strings and
blobs can't be forced into 8 bytes without making them useless.</p><p>So we could extract extreme performance out of all the fixed-length values, but
these variable-length values dragged the performance back down.</p><p>Which brings us to pages and how data is referenced in memory.</p><h2>Pages of data</h2><p>QuestDB uses memory-mapped pages to reference data in order to make it really
fast. If you're dividing up your data into pages, and all data has a fixed
length, then it's relatively easy to ensure that you don't have data that spans
multiple pages. You just break pages at multiples of 8-bytes and everything will
fit within page boundaries.</p><p>When you add variable-length data, suddenly you cannot ensure that everything
will line up along page boundaries and you will have the very real possibility
-- actually a certainty -- that you may have to jump from one page to another
just to get all the data contained in a frame.</p><p>This, it turns out, is hugely inefficient. If (data is in frame) then (process
that data) else (figure out where the rest of the data is, get that, then
process it all). This kind of if-then-else sprinkled throughout the code is a)
hard to debug and b) leads to lots of branching, which slows down execution.</p><p>In order to prevent variable length data from straddling frames we would need to
have different frame lengths per column. Furthermore, calculating aligned frame
lengths for variable length data is non trivial and requires scanning the entire
data set which would reversing any performance gains from parallelization.</p><h2>One page to rule them all</h2><p>(Yes, I just made a <em>The Highlander</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference</a>)</p><p>What if, in order to get around data being on multiple pages, we simply used
<em>one</em> page for all of the data? Of course my first question was "Don't you at
some point reach a limit on the page size?" but Vlad and Patrick assured me
there is, indeed, no limit on a page size.</p><p>If your page size is bigger than the available memory, the kernel will handle
swapping pages in and out for you as you try to access different parts of the
page. So of course I asked "well then, why didn't you do this from the
beginning?"</p><p>Vlad, in his typically self-deprecating style, just said "We didn't know. We
thought we should keep them to a certain size to keep them from growing out of
control" which, quite frankly, seems like the right answer.</p><p>We'd just resize those smaller pages as needed. But as Vlad explained, if you do
that then you need to copy the data over to the new, resized page and "copying
can take over your life." Databases aren't built to maximize the efficiency of
data copying. They are built to maximize the ability to extract value from data.
Copying data from one page to another isn't extracting value.</p><p>So they tried just allocating a new page, and jumping from one page to the next
as needed to find the required data. This cut down on the copying of data, but
it lead to the problems outlined in the previous section. You never knew which
page your data was going to be on, and jumping from one page to another was
hugely inefficient.</p><p>So they tried having just the one page. One massive page (that you can grow as
needed, without copying data around). Vlad, again in his style, said the
performance turned out to be "not bad" with this approach. And by "not bad" he
of course meant about a 60% performance improvement.</p><p>When you get into using one single page, of course the total available address
space comes into play. But since QuestDB only runs on 64-bit architectures, we
have 2^64 address space, which is more than enough.</p><p>This is where Patrick jumped in to explain that when you have an area of memory
mapped from a file, when the file grows you remap the new size into memory. The
operating system does not need to copy anything; the virtual memory model allows
the OS to just remap the already mapped pages into the newly mapped memory
region. In many cases, the OS may have already reserved the entire address space
for you so your new mapping is in the same region as the old, just bigger.</p><h2>Kernels are smart</h2><p>The kernel allocated a full sized address space for your file when you requested
the memory-mapped file. And apparently this is true across Linux, macOS and
Windows. So from that point on, there's really no further copying that needs to
happen.</p><p>Furthermore, the kernel is going to handle paging parts of that file in and out
of memory as needed. Now, I'm old-school Unix, and page-swapping which lead to
thrashing was always something we worried about back in the olden days. So I
asked about it. According to Patrick, this could only happen really if you have
a massive file that you are reading basically randomly at high speed. Other than
that, the kernel will handle reading ahead and pre-loading pages as needed in
order to be as efficient as possible.</p><p>Kernels, it turns out, are smart. In fact, kernels are basically smarter than
you or I will ever hope to be. They've been developed across decades to be
hugely efficient at doing these things. It's what they do. The kernel will
memory map the file into the file cache and even if it needs to move stuff
around, it can move the logical address and it's still the same underlying
physical memory pages.</p><p>If you think that you can take over caching the data from the OS and do a better
job of managing the memory space, and the allocation and re-allocation of the
memory, you're wrong. Again, this is what the Kernel does, and at some level,
even if you try to take this job away from the kernel, it is <em>still</em> doing some
amount of it anyway. So your attempts to take this memory management and
allocation away from the kernel has done little more than just add another layer
on top of what the kernel is doing anyway. Another layer on top of something is
basically never more efficient than the original thing.</p><p>When you read an offset into a file, you send a buffer to read into, the address
to start reading at, and the offset into the file. Now, the kernel is going to
cache all of that for you as you do it, because that's the kernel's job, really.
But many database developers then take that, and cache it themselves, with their
own caching scheme.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>When I asked Vlad about this, and how it relates to query speed, he was quite
explicit in saying that thinking you (a database developer) can beat the kernel
is pure folly. Postgres tries this and, according to Vlad, an aggregation over a
large (really large!) dataset can take 5 <em>minutes</em>, whereas the same aggregation
on QuestDB takes only 60ms. Those aren't typos.</p><p>To both Patrick and Vlad (and me, for what that's worth), the idea that we, as
developers, can be better at these operations than the kernel (when really we're
doing them <em>on top of</em> the kernel anyway) is simply ridiculous. If I take an
army of researchers and spend a decade of development, then <em>maybe</em> I can do it
better than the kernel, but during that time guess what? The army of people
working on the kernel will have found further improvements and left me behind
anyway.</p><p>It comes down to letting the kernel do its job, and us doing ours. And our job
is to exploit the kernel for every ounce of performance we can get out of it
without trying to do it's job for it.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>When it comes to performance claims, we always try to back them up with actual
numbers that can be replicated. You can run these tests yourself, and you can
always go and look at the
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>

September 4, 2020 | https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>
  Theoretically, staging environments sound nice. Why wouldn’t you want
  something that previews what the code will look like before production? The
  issue is what happens in practice.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a big ask. To show how much of a big ask it is let’s walk through an
  example. Say that there’s a developer named Bob. Bob works in a 7 person
  startup that is building a SaaS tool. Their stack has three parts: a static
  HTML frontend, a node backend, and a Postgres server.
</p>
<p>
  This week, one of Bob’s goals is to set up a staging environment to get those
  sweet sweet previews everyone’s been talking about. It looks simple enough,
  they’re already using serverless to deploy their frontend so the job is
  reduced down to hooking up some pipeline to deploy a version of the frontend
  for each new commit on a separate subdomain.
</p>
<h4>Issue 1: Version Incompatibilities With The Backend</h4>
<p>
  That works and he’s happy. Two weeks later though, there are some issues. The
  team is working on a major feature that’s been in development for the past few
  days on a separate branch. It includes both changes to the frontend and a new
  endpoint on the backend. So the staging environment crashes because it tries
  to talk to the backend while the backend doesn’t have the endpoint. The
  solution? Give the staging environment its backend. Bob wrangles the pipeline
  a bit to deploy a backend and a frontend for each change. After a few days of
  work, it’s done and he’s happy.
</p>
<h4>Issue 2: Handing Database Schema Changes</h4>
<p>
  Three weeks later, there's an issue again. Now the team is working on a
  feature that includes a schema change on the database. They can’t use the
  staging environment because the server crashes due to incompatibility with the
  database. The solution seems clear. Bring the database into the staging
  environment. He wrangles the pipeline to spin up a new DB for each commit and
  run migration scripts on startup every time. Now the staging environment is a
  complete miniature copy of what’s happening in production. There shouldn’t be
  any more issues going forward. Right?
</p>
<h4>Issue 3: Maintaining The Codebase For Different Target Environments</h4>
<p>
  Wrong. Bob notices something unexpected. The team is using staging
  environments less than before. Turns out it's a hassle to have to create a new
  user account and generate content every time they want to test things on the
  staging environment. They started seeding the staging database on startup, but
  then realized they now have to maintain code to seed the database for each
  table inside it, and that’s a hassle.
</p>
<p>
  <b>As the staging environment grew more complicated, it became less easy to
    work with.</b>
  In the future, the backend might need another service to function like a Redis
  instance or a new microservice. That’s gonna have to go into the staging
  environment too. Maybe Bob should have stopped at just the frontend and kept
  the staging environment hooked up to the production backend.
</p>
<p>
  But then the team risks incompatibility issues when the staging frontend
  expects a different version of the production backend it’s talking to. At
  best, the frontend will throw errors occasionally, at
  <b> worst it will silently leave corrupted data on the database</b>.
</p>
<h4>Staging Isn't Easy</h4>
<p>
  If your team doesn't have the bandwidth or the resources to build a pipeline
  that can spin up entire miniature copies of the production environment,
  <b>staging isn't for you</b>. The biggest draw for staging environments is to
  visually inspect changes to the frontend. The backend parts of the codebase
  can often be more conveniently verified through testing.
</p>
<p>
  For previewing frontends, we built Capsule for developers like Bob’s team. You
  can use the extension to make HTML recordings of the frontend. Just by linking
  to your capsule in the PRs, you'd be able to do the same thing a staging
  environment can do with none of the work of maintaining a staging environment
  pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Say that I was part of the google calendar team, and wanted to share my local
  changes. I click on the extension, and boom:
</p>

<p>
  I have a shareable link to my changes. No maintance; no deployment pipelines
  needed.
</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

<h3>Learn how to implement an automated machine learning strategy with the goal of finding the optimal stocks for algorithmic trading.</h3>



<hr>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/0*Qin1Uu6TF6EGY9Qe" alt="Image for post" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@stephenleo1982?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Leonardi</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p id="761b">With the increasing popularity of machine learning, many traders are looking for ways in which they can “teach” a computer to trade for them. This process is called algorithmic trading (sometimes called algo-trading).</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Algorithmic trading is a hands off strategy for buying and selling stocks that leverages technical indicators instead of human intuition.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p id="8e73">In order to implement an algorithmic trading strategy though, you have to first narrow down a list of stocks that you want to analyze. This walk-through provides an automated process (using python and logistic regression) for determining the best stocks to algo-trade.</p>



<p id="45b0">I will dive deeper into the logic and code below, but here is a high-level overview of the process:</p>



<ol><li>Import the historical data of every stock using yahoo finance.</li><li>Pull in over 32 technical indicators for each stock using the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</li><li>Perform a logistic regression on each stock using 5, 30, and 60 day observation time periods.</li><li>Interpret the results.</li></ol>



<hr>



<h2 id="7355">Import Necessary Libraries</h2>



<p id="9268">Running this program in python requires these libraries:</p>

<h2 id="8a50">Collecting Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="b37a">Obtaining historical data on the stocks that we want to observe is a two-step process.</p>



<ol><li>Narrow down a list of stocks that we want to observe.</li><li>Make individual calls to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>&nbsp;in order to import data about each company.</li></ol>



<p id="d925"><strong>Choosing the Stocks We Want to Target</strong></p>



<p id="b1b8">The library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>&nbsp;allows us to compile a list of stock tickers by filtering companies on aspects like market cap or exchange. For this example, I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions).</p>



<p id="b0b7">You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. This is very important. You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<p id="a75a">We also need to remove and create a folder on our local machine to hold historical stock data. Note that before this step runs for the first time, you will need to manually create this folder. This step is important because it will get rid of the data from past iterations and allow the program to start new.</p>



<div><pre data-file="https://gist.github.com/cameronShadmehry/7fd146a70470186482eadefde6dec7ea#file-atlr_gettickers-py" data-lang="Python"><code># List of the stocks we are interested in analyzing. At the time of writing this, it narrows the list of stocks down to 44.
# If you have a list of your own you would like to use just create a new list instead of using this, for example: tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", ...] 
tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)

# Check that the amount of tickers isn't more than 2000
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))

# These two lines remove the Stocks folder and then recreate it in order to remove old stocks. Make sure you have created a Stocks Folder the first time you run this.

os.mkdir("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Bayesian_Logistic_Regression\\Stocks\\")</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="c45e">Importing Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="1c9d">We will now obtain the historical price data of each stock in our tickers list by making independent calls to Yahoo Finance. After receiving the data, the program will save each company’s information in a new CSV file that will be located in the folder you created beforehand.</p>

Amount_of_API_Calls = 0

# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2
# seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again.
# Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP. The clause "(Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800)" below will stop the loop from making
# too many calls to the yfinance API.

<h2 id="2687">Importing Technical Indicators</h2>



<p id="a921">In order to run a logistic regression on each stock, we need to substantiate the independent variables. These 32+ technical indicators will act as predictor variables for the dependent variable.</p>



<p id="6e7c">To bring in the technical indicators we make use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</p>



<p id="1d04">You will also notice that we are creating three extra columns. These will act as the value we are trying to predict (dependent variable) with the model. The three variables are 5, 30, and 60 day observations of the closing prices of each stock (1 if it increased and 0 if it did not).</p>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

<p>This summer, I am again <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/11/research-assistant.html">working on Rust full-time</a>, and again I will work (amongst other things) on a “memory model” for Rust/MIR.
However, before I can talk about the ideas I have for this year, I have to finally take the time and dispel the myth that “pointers are simple: they are just integers”.
Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.</p>

<p>I also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what <em>is</em> the data that is stored in memory?
It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte?
Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)</p>

<h2 id="pointers-are-complicated">Pointers Are Complicated</h2>

<p>What is the problem with “pointers are just integers”?  Let us consider the following example:<br>
(I am using C++ code here mostly because writing unsafe code is easier in C++ than in Rust, and unsafe code is where these problems really show up. C has all the same issues, as does unsafe Rust.)</p>

    <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It would be beneficial to be able to optimize the final read of <code>y[0]</code> to just return <code>42</code>.
The justification for this optimization is that writing to <code>x_ptr</code>, which points into <code>x</code>, cannot change <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>However, given how low-level a language C++ is, we can actually break this assumption by setting <code>i</code> to <code>y-x</code>.
Since <code>&amp;x[i]</code> is the same as <code>x+i</code>, this means we are actually writing <code>23</code> to <code>&amp;y[0]</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, that does not stop C++ compilers from doing these optimizations.
To allow this, the standard declares our code to have <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/14/undefined-behavior.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, it is not allowed to perform pointer arithmetic (like <code>&amp;x[i]</code> does) that goes <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">beyond either end of the array it started in</a>.
Our program violates this rule: <code>x[i]</code> is outside of <code>x</code>, so this is undefined behavior.
To be clear: Just the <em>computation</em> of <code>x_ptr</code> is already UB, we don’t even get to the part where we want to <em>use</em> this pointer!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But we are not done yet: This rule has a special exception that we can exploit to our advantage.
If the arithmetic ends up computing a pointer <em>just past</em> the end of an allocation, that computation is fine.
(This exception is necessary to permit computing <code>vec.end()</code> for the usual kind of C++98 iterator loop.)</p>

<p>So let us change this example a bit:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>+</span><span>8</span><span>;</span> <span>// one past the end</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>==</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
      <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, imagine that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have been allocated <em>right next to each other</em>, with <code>y</code> having the higher address.
Then <code>x_ptr</code> actually points <em>right at the beginning</em> of <code>y</code>!
The conditional is true and the write happens.
Still, there is no UB due to out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>This seems to break the optimization.
However, the C++ standard has another trick up its sleeve to help compiler writers: It doesn’t actually allow us to <em>use</em> our <code>x_ptr</code> above.
According to what the standard says about <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">addition on pointers</a>, <code>x_ptr</code> points “one past the last element of the array object”.
It does <em>not</em> point at an actual element of another object <em>even if they have the same address</em>. (At least, that is the common interpretation of the standard based on which <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/vxmtej">LLVM optimizes this code</a>.)</p>

<p>The key point here is that just because <code>x_ptr</code> and <code>&amp;y[0]</code> point to the same <em>address</em>, that does not make them <em>the same pointer</em>, i.e., they cannot be used interchangeably:
<code>&amp;y[0]</code> points to the first element of <code>y</code>; <code>x_ptr</code> points past the end of <code>x</code>.
If we replace <code>*x_ptr = 23</code> by <code>*&amp;y[0] = 0</code>, we change the meaning of the program, even though the two pointers have been tested for equality.</p>

<p>This is worth repeating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal and can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this sounds subtle, it is.
In fact, this still causes miscompilations in both <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35229">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65752">GCC</a>.</p>

<p>Also notice that this one-past-the-end rule is not the only part of C/C++ where this effect can be witnessed.
Another example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict"><code>restrict</code></a> keyword in C, which can be used to express that pointers do not alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Calling <code>test()</code> triggers UB because the two accesses in <code>foo</code> must not alias.
Replacing <code>*y</code> by <code>*x</code> in <code>foo</code> changes the meaning of the program such that it no longer has UB.
So, again, even though <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the same address, they cannot be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Pointers are definitely not integers.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-pointer-model">A Simple Pointer Model</h2>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> a pointer?
I don’t know the full answer to this.
In fact, this is an open area of research.</p>

<p>One important point to stress here is that we are just looking for an <em>abstract model</em> of the pointer.
Of course, on the actual machine, pointers are integers.
But the actual machine also does not do the kind of optimizations that modern C++ compilers do, so it can get away with that.
If we wrote the above programs in assembly, there would be no UB, and no optimizations.
C++ and Rust employ a more “high-level” view of memory and pointers, restricting the programmer for the benefit of optimizations.
When formally describing what the programmer may and may not do in these languages, as we have seen, the model of pointers as integers falls apart, so we have to look for something else.
This is another example of using a “virtual machine” that’s different from the real machine for specification purposes, which is an idea <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html">I have blogged about before</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple proposal (in fact, this is the model of pointers used in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00703441/document">CompCert</a> and my <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/08/rustbelt.html">RustBelt work</a>, and it is also how <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">miri</a> implements <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fefe81605d6111faa8dbb3635ab2c51d59de740a/src/librustc/mir/interpret/mod.rs#L121-L124">pointers</a>):
A pointer is a pair of some kind of ID uniquely identifying the <em>allocation</em>, and an <em>offset</em> into the allocation.
If we defined this in Rust, we might write</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>alloc_id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>isize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding/subtracting an integer to/from a pointer just acts on the offset, and can thus never leave the allocation.
Subtracting a pointer from another is only allowed when both point to the same allocation (matching <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#6">C++</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It turns out (and miri shows) that this model can get us very far.
We always remember which allocation a pointer points to, so we can differentiate a pointer “one past the end” of one allocation from a pointer to the beginning of another allocation.
That’s how miri can detect that our second example (with <code>&amp;x[8]</code>) is UB.</p>

<h2 id="the-model-falls-apart">The Model Falls Apart</h2>

<p>In this model, pointers are not integers, but they are at least simple.
However, this simple model starts to fall apart once you consider pointer-integer casts.
In miri, casting a pointer to an integer does not actually do anything, we now just have an integer variable (i.e., its <em>type</em> says it is an integer) whose <em>value</em> is a pointer (i.e., an allocation-offset pair).
However, multiplying that “integer” by 2 leads to an error, because it is entirely unclear what it means to multiply such an abstract pointer by 2.</p>

<p>I should clarify that this is <em>not</em> a good solution when defining language semantics.
It works fine for an interpreter though.
It is the most lazy thing to do, and we do it because it is not clear what else to do (other than not supporting these casts at all – but this way, miri can run more programs):
In our abstract machine, there just is no single coherent “address space” that all allocations live in, that we could use to map every pointer to a distinct integer.
Every allocation is just identified by an (unobservable) ID.
We could now start to enrich this model with extra data like a base address for each allocation, and somehow use that when casting an integer back to a pointer… but that’s where it gets really complicated, and anyway discussing such a model is not the point of this post.
The point it to discuss the <em>need</em> for such a model.
If you are interested, I suggest you read <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Estevez/papers/KHM+15.pdf">this paper</a> that explores the above idea of adding a base address.</p>

<p>Long story short, pointer-integer casts are messy and hard to define formally when also considering optimizations like we discussed above.
There is a conflict between the high-level view that is required to enable optimizations, and the low-level view that is required to explain casting a pointer to an integer and back.
We mostly just ignore the problem in miri and opportunistically do as much as we can, given the simple model we are working with.
A full definition of a language like C++ or Rust of course cannot take this shortcut, it has to explain what really happens here.
To my knowledge, no satisfying solution exists, but academic research is <a href="http://sf.snu.ac.kr/publications/llvmtwin.pdf">getting closer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This was by no means meant to be an exhaustive list of academic research on C in general. I do not know of other work that focuses directly on the interplay of integer-pointer casts and optimizations, but other noteworthy work on formalizing C includes <a href="https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics">KCC</a>, <a href="https://robbertkrebbers.nl/thesis.html">Robbert Krebber’s PhD thesis</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">Cerberus</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<p>This is why pointers are not simple, either.</p>

<h2 id="from-pointers-to-bytes">From Pointers to Bytes</h2>

<p>I hope I made a convincing argument that integers are not the only data one has to consider when formally specifying low-level languages such as C++ or (the unsafe parts of) Rust.
However, this means that a simple operation like loading a byte from memory cannot just return a <code>u8</code>.
Imagine we <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/rlibc/blob/defb486e765846417a8e73329e8c5196f1dca49a/src/lib.rs#L39">implement <code>memcpy</code></a> by loading (in turn) every byte of the source into some local variable <code>v</code>, and then storing it to the target.
What if that byte is part of a pointer?  When a pointer is a pair of allocation and offset, what is its first byte?
We have to …</p></article></div>

                    <p>WireGuard is pretty great!</p><p>You might have noticed the buzz around <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> lately.
WireGuard is a very simple VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, and the buzz comes from both the fact that it’s simple and good at what it does, and the fact that it’s so good that it’s going to be included in the Linux kernel by default.
Linus Torvalds himself said that <a href="http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2018/08/02/124">he loves it</a>, which took the software world by storm, as we weren’t aware that Linus was capable of love or any emotion other than perkele.</p>
<p>The only problem I’ve found with WireGuard is a lack of documentation, or rather a lack of documentation where you expect it.
The <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">quickstart</a> guide, the first thing I look at, mentions a configuration file that it never tells you how to write, and it also assumes you’re more familiar with networking than I am.</p>
<p>Since the initial conditions at the creation of the universe set things up so WireGuard would eventually be underdocumented, I am going against Creation itself and showing you how to easily configure and run it.
Let’s <!-- break -->begin!</p>
<h2>Short overview</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/guard-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>A guard that looks kinda wiry, and makes sure you don't subconsciously find this post dry and boring.</span></p></div><p>At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another.
It doesn’t really let you access other computers on either end of the network, or forward all your traffic through the VPN server, or anything like that.
It just connects two computers, directly, quickly and securely.</p>
<p>To do anything other than that, you’ll need to configure your network for it, which is “out of scope” for the WireGuard docs, but which I consider very much in the scope of a VPN.
Luckily, WireGuard comes with a helper script, <code>wg-quick</code>, which will do pretty much everything the average user needs.
Keep in mind that the configuration files for <code>wg-quick</code> aren’t compatible with the <code>wg</code> executable, but <code>wg-quick</code> is all we’ll need, so that shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Let’s start setting everything up.</p>
<h2>Installation and setup</h2>
<p>To install WireGuard, see <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">the installation</a> page, it should be a pretty simple process.
After you’ve installed it, you will need to generate a private and a public key for each computer you want accessing the VPN.
Due to WireGuard’s design, both computers on either end of a connection will need to have each other’s public key.</p>
<p>Let’s generate these keys. On each of the computers that will be in the VPN, create the directory <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and run these commands <em>on each of the computers</em> in the directory you just created:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ <span>umask</span> <span>077</span>  <span># This makes sure credentials don't leak in a race condition.</span>
$ wg genkey <span>|</span> tee privatekey <span>|</span> wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</pre></div>
<p>This will generate two files, <code>privatekey</code> and <code>publickey</code> on each of the computers.
The <code>publickey</code> file is for telling the world, the <code>privatekey</code> file is secret and should stay on the computer it was generated on.
You need to paste the contents of these files in the config file, I’m afraid WireGuard doesn’t support referencing them by path yet.</p>
<p>If your VPN server is behind a NAT, you’ll also need to open a UDP port of your choosing (<code>51820</code> by default).
Do this for any computer you want to connect <em>to</em> (computers that you’ll connect <em>from</em> don’t need a port open, as far as I know, but correct me if I’m wrong).</p>
<h2>Common scenarios</h2>
<p>After you’ve done the above, you’re ready to configure WireGuard.
Go to <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and create a file called <code>wg0.conf</code> on each of your computers.
We’ll go over some common scenarions along with the configuration for each.</p>
<h3>Just a single connection</h3>
<p>If you just want a single connection between two computers (say, to connect your laptop to your home server), the configuration is pretty simple.
On the server, enter the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.1</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>51820</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2/32</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That’s all you need for the server.
Keep in mind that <code>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</code> is your home server’s <code>privatekey</code> file’s contents (<strong>not</strong> the path to the file, the actual <strong>contents</strong>, a long line of gibberish), and <code>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</code> is similarly the contents of your laptop’s <code>publickey</code> file.</p>
<p>For the client, here’s the configuration:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24</span>

<span># This is for if you're behind a NAT and</span>
<span># want the connection to be kept alive.</span>
<span>PersistentKeepalive</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, replace the keys with the appropriate strings you generated.</p>
<p>As you can see, the addresses I picked for each computer are <code>192.168.2.1</code> and <code>192.168.2.2</code>, because that subnet was free in my setup.
If there’s an interface with that subnet on either computer, you should pick another one, such as <code>192.168.3.x</code>, to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>After writing the two files, run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> on the server and then on the client.
The two machines should now be connected if you entered the server’s IP in the config and configured the port correctly, and you should be able to <code>ping 192.168.2.1</code> from the VPN client and see the responses.
To close the connection again, just run <code>wg-quick down wg0</code>.</p>
<p>I repeat that <em>this setup only lets you access the server’s interface from the client</em>, it won’t forward any of your traffic over the server or let you access any other machines on the server’s LAN.</p>
<h3>Accessing your home LAN</h3>
<p>To actually access the server’s LAN, you’ll need to make a slight modification to the configuration.
On the server’s config file, at the end of the the <code>[Interface]</code> section, add these two lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PostUp</span>   <span>=</span> <span>iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
<span>PostDown</span> <span>=</span> <span>iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that your LAN interface is called <code>eth0</code>.
If it isn’t, change the lines above to the actual name.</p>
<p>On the client, add your LAN’s subnet under <code>AllowedIPs</code>.
For example, if your subnet is <code>192.168.1.x</code>, change <code>AllowedIPs</code> to look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Briefly, the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting acts as <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing">a routing table when sending, and an ACL when receiving</a>.
When a peer tries to send a packet to an IP, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code>, and if the IP appears in the list, it will send it through the WireGuard interface.
When it receives a packet over the interface, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code> again, and if the packet’s source address is not in the list, it will be dropped.</p>
<p>You might need to enable IP forwarding on the server for this to work, but it’s a simple process for Linux. <a href="http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/">Here’s a good guide</a>. If you’re running an OS X or Windows server, you don’t deserve nice things.</p>
<p>Then run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> as above, and you should be able to ping the other computers in the LAN from the client, as if you were home.
Try <code>ping 192.168.1.1</code> or any other computer in your LAN to verify.</p>
<p>Do note that <em>this won’t forward any other traffic</em> through your server, so it won’t proxy your web browsing or anything like that.
It will just let you talk to other machines on your server’s LAN.</p>
<p>For traffic forwarding, see below:</p>
<h3>Forwarding all your traffic through</h3>
<p>If you want to forward <em>all</em> your traffic through the VPN, WireGuard can easily do that as well.
Keep in mind that, if you’re doing this to avoid ISP tracking, it won’t work against your server’s ISP.
All your traffic will just look like it’s coming from your server, but if that’s at your house, all your torrents and porn downloading is just going to look like it’s coming from there, even though you’re at a net cafe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>To forward all the traffic through, simply change the <code>AllowedIPs</code> line on the client to this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here’s the entire client config again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will make the <code>wg0</code> interface responsible for routing all IP addresses (hence the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>), and should route all your traffic over your server.
You can check by loading one of the <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">what is my IP</a> websites and seeing that your server’s IP is what’s detected.</p>
<h2>Securing and running on startup</h2>
<p>After you’re done, run the following to make the directory and files readable only by administrators (it <em>does</em> contain secret keys, after all):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo chown -R root:root /etc/wireguard/

<p>After you’ve created and secured the file, you can easily set WireGuard to initialize the VPN on startup if your OS is using <code>systemd</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl <span>enable</span> wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to start or stop the service:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>

<p>I hope this has been useful!
It’s the guide I wish existed before I spent three hours trying to configure WireGuard, and hopefully you can just copy the configs and have it work right away.</p>
<p>If you need the configuration for IPv6, I’m afraid you’re going to have to experiment yourself, as my ISP does not support it, but feel free to let me know what should be added and I can amend the article.</p>

<p>
I'm taking a break from debugging books to talk about a calamitous shitshow of textbook writing: <i>Mastering C Pointers: Tools for Programming Power</i>, by Robert J. Traister.
</p>

<p>
I learned of the book through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SUkrR7ZfTA">talk</a> by Brian Kernighan where he refers to the book as probably “the worst C programming textbook ever written.”<span>[<a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a>]</span>
He doesn't name it but <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1003411102791692288">with some help</a> I was able to track down his obliquely accurate reference.
</p>

<p>
This book has become my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20whale">white whale</a>.
Since I started reading debugging books, and especially now that I'm digging through older ones, I find bits of advice that simply don't work today.
While some of it could be construed as useless or idiotic, I've always found the authors come from a position of earnestness, attempting to draw the best conclusions based on decent principles and what they knew at the time they wrote it.
In some cases they may not have known much, but they're honestly and humbly trying to impart some wisdom.
</p>

<p>
When Kernighan put up the following example, I saw what seemed to be the opposite of that.
</p>

<pre>char *combine(s, t)
char *s, *t;
{

      int x, y;
      char r[100];

      strcpy(r, s);
      y = strlen(r);
      for (x = y; *t != '\0'; ++x)
           r[x] = *t++;

      r[x] = '\0';

      return(r);

}
</pre>

<p>
This program (formatting preserved) is taken from the first edition of the book (p.146).
It's horrific (Kernighan calls it “malpractice”).
It does not exhibit the genuineness I have seen with, say, books from the late 1970s on how to debug BASIC programs.
I didn't know what it was.
Deceit?
Laziness?
Unremitting ignorance?
What is the mindset of someone who writes this, presumably thinking it's a good idea?
Can the whole book be that bad?
Kernighan said it was.
I had to know.
</p>

<p>
The book has two editions: the first was published in 1990, the second in 1993.
The fact that there are two editions piqued my curiosity even more.
It sold enough to make another version?
Is that horrible example corrected?
I obtained a copy of each and read them.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the book is pointless.
Kernighan was right: it's garbage.
And the second edition only makes things worse.
Teaching from either one would be a breach of ethics.
If you follow Traister’s coding practices, even adjusted for today's standards, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to create defects and vicious, latent bugs.
A subtly pernicious aspect of the book is the casual tone of the writing.
It’s informal enough that if you don’t really know much about C what he says sort of makes sense, despite the sloppy terminology and mixed, inaccurate metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Any trained programmer will recognize the lessons as worthless.
His terminology is all over the map and typically inaccurate, if not plainly wrong.
Expressions “return a value.”
Values are “handed” into locations.
Constants are “written directly into the program.”
A union is a “specialized pointer.”
The terminology isn’t even consistent.
Micro-optimizations are stressed at all times, and program efficiency is valued over comprehension.
He can’t even define a pointer correctly: “A pointer is a special variable that returns the address of a memory location.”
It does not take long to realize Traister has no idea what he’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Although I’m not going to go over the content (that would take far too long since there’s nothing redeeming there), I did take extensive notes.
You can <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/notes.html">read them</a>, if you are so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I must, however, take a moment to single out the code.
It is universally bad and much of it is simply wrong.
(Imagine trying to learn programming principles from a book that contains a large number of programs that don’t even compile.)
I’ve <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/code.html">transcribed</a> some of the programs and annotated them with comments so that you can get a taste of how inept Traister is as a C programmer.
One thing to keep in mind (both for the programs and the notes) is that C89/C90 was new at the time and that the code was written on (and for) MS-DOS systems of the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Things were a bit different then.
</p>

<p>
Enough about the material.
I want to explore the question of how something so wrong even got written.  It’s not that everything in the book is wrong, but it feels like when it’s right, it’s right by accident.
</p>

<p>
Traister has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-J.-Traister/e/B001H6UPHY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1529540256&amp;sr=1-1">written</a> other books, some about electronics and some about programming, one called <i>Going from BASIC to C</i>.
In <i>Mastering C Pointers</i>, he talks about a product he created called CBREEZE that converts BASIC code to C.
Throughout the book he makes passing, roundabout references to BASIC and uses terminology that suggests he’s written a lot of BASIC code.
For example, there is a whole chapter on using pointers to access memory, where reading and writing memory is instead called “peeking” and “poking”, based on the PEEK and POKE instructions in BASIC.
He also says that it took him a couple of tries to learn C coming from BASIC.
In short, I’m convinced he’s knowledgeable about BASIC and has worked on writing software for small, electronic devices.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important?
As I read the book (and if you read my notes, you know where this is going) I started to notice something in the wording and tone.
The further I progressed the more I became convinced of it, and I think it explains how he managed to mangle the explanation of C pointers so badly.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think he understands the call stack.
</p>

<p>
My argument for this interpretation requires a little knowledge of BASIC and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
With BASIC, the key thing to know about most implementations at the time is that there were no functions and no scope aside from the global scope.<span>[<a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a>]</span>
The closest thing to a function in BASIC is the GOSUB command.
The GOSUB command jumps to a line and executes code until it gets to a RETURN statement, where control is transferred back to the line following the GOSUB command.
Within a GOSUB you can jump somewhere else with another GOSUB.
The control follows a stack principle, but no arguments are passed.
GOSUB routines are a way to factor out common code, but that common code has to work on global variables.
(And yes, it’s as terrible as it sounds.)
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the case of simple electronic devices.
Even today some embedded devices, usually programmed using C, do not have a call stack that dynamically allocates space for automatic variables.
There simply isn’t enough memory for it.
Instead, the compiler lays out memory such that each function’s local variables have fixed memory addresses (a “compiled stack” model).
The only stack you have is for return addresses and it is probably handled in hardware.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you’re used to writing BASIC for small memory electronic devices and you learn about C.
You read about pointers and realize something: it’s possible to write a subroutine that can change variables <i>without knowing their names</i>.
It’s manna from heaven!
You don’t have to devote global variables to being the “parameters” of your subroutines anymore.
Life is great.
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset I think Traister had and never got past.
In the book there is one fleeting mention of the stack in reference to excessive (automatic) memory allocation.
(On MS-DOS, if the space for local variables is too large in the program, it might not compile.)
He consistently describes variables as having “exclusive” addresses in the program.
His writing about pointers suggests that he thinks, for each function, space is set aside to hold the local variables for the duration of the program, but you can only access them when inside the function in which they were declared.
So pointers are really powerful because you can provide this address to another function and it can change the value using only a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence for his lack of understanding is that he frequently cites ridiculous space micro-optimizations within functions, such as avoiding the use of integers for index variables, if possible.
Another one, mentioned often, is local <code>char</code> arrays that have a fixed size.
There are good reasons to not use them but his are not among them.
His admonishment is that they waste space.
Technically, that is true, but they don't exist until they're on the stack.
And he never talks about global or file variables.
He only refers to locals with “exclusive” addresses “set aside” for variables.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation runs into some problems once you start asking how functions with malloc will work, but it's worth pointing out that there is almost no discussion about memory management.
In a book devoted to C pointers, that's a toxic mix of gross negligence and incompetence.
There is literally one short paragraph devoted to talking about the <code>free</code> function—and it's characterized as a “side note.”
</p>

<p>
Another sticking point in this interpretation is Traister’s incomprehensible approach to writing functions that take a variable number of arguments.
He does this by passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function (the first being the number of arguments) and accessing them using offsets from the address of the first argument.
This suggests he has some idea about parameters being passed in a dynamic fashion, but it is so spectacularly wrong<span>[<a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a>]</span> you’re left wondering if he even tried his programs out before publishing them.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, this is the most generous interpretation of the text I could come up with, and it still paints a terrible picture.
Occam's Razor suggests that Traister is just clueless.
But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01l1WIC9mBo">analyzing a terrible movie</a> that somehow gets made, it's more fun to reason through the “behind the scenes” parts.
</p>

<p>
Given the ineptness of the book, you'd think it was self-published.
You would be wrong.
It was published through Academic Press, which was a division of Harcourt, Brace &amp; World at the time, but is now an “imprint of Elsevier.”
</p>

<p>
In the preface of the second edition it says that the first edition was reviewed “by a professional C programmer hired by the publisher.”
That programmer said it should not be published.
That programmer was right, but the publisher went ahead and …</p></div></div>

This proxy battle over social status pitted "techlash" cheerleaders against those of us who understand that neither ROI nor innovation grows on trees.

First of all, how is "👏👏👏" your standard for jokes, yikes. Secondly, @VCBrags' gimmick would be considered textbook harassment if aimed at less fashionable targets.</p><p>That's the term for habitually taunting users who have blocked you, right? Are we changing the rules now and it's hunky-dory to repeatedly tweet imputed insults at women (and men) who clearly don't want to chat? Wait, I thought tech was supposed to be woke 🤔</p><p><em>I </em>didn't establish these standards as mainstream, but I sure do notice when they're violated. And frankly @VCBrags' sense of humor was cruel. Here's the most recent tweet that I consider beyond-the-pale rude, honestly just plain mean:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png 1168w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>She wears sunscreen and takes calls with aspiring entrepreneurs, <em><a href="https://twitter.com/VCBrags/status/1296193655615651853">quelle horreur</a></em>!

"The intention was never to punch down," hmm?</figcaption></figure><p>That post isn't out of character, nor is it a new development. The point of @VCBrags has <em>always</em> been to shit on people for celebrating, or even simply expressing enthusiasm. I don't blame Hunter Walk for being unaware, since I doubt that he's read through the backlog, but @VCBrags <em>never</em> bothered to selectively skewer the inordinately pompous.

You can't even appreciate animal onesies?</figcaption></figure><p>The reason to write about this Twitter drama is pretty simple: Culture matters. As I've pointed out before, that's why <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/multiplayer-psychosis/">everyone gets so worked up</a>. It would be ludicrous to claim that conceptions of <em>coolness</em> don't have real-world effects; I can attest that my own street cred has been hugely advantageous, and I am by no means a big deal.</p><p>If we want to <a href="https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/">build the awesome future directly</a>, we need to point out who is a pernicious influence, who focuses on tearing others down rather than building them up — <em>especially</em> if they amass clout by doing so, then use it to initiate a negativity flywheel. Personally I can excuse moderate and occasional bitchiness (including from myself), but not the devoted focus of @VCBrags.</p><p>And yes, there should be reputational consequences for this behavior. Nobody needs to be fired, I'm not advocating for that, but bad-faith critics of the tech industry and those who work in it should be identified and ignored. After all, we genuinely do want to grow and improve! Meekly accepting malice, versus insisting on constructive feedback, undermines that effort.</p><p>So let's talk about Pasquale, this story's <em>enfant terrible</em>. It may be a tad confusing if you didn't see the saga unfold on Twitter — I won't recap every detail, but you can get up to speed here:</p><figure><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/09/01/the-enduring-mystery-around-an-anonymous-twitter-account-that-infuriated-techs-kingpins-and-nearly-ruined-a-founders-reputation/#4879f4d8548d"><div><p>The Enduring Mystery Around An Anonymous Twitter Account That Infuriated Tech’s Kingpins—And Nearly Ruined A Founder’s Reputation</p><p>By lampooning venture capitalists, @VCBrags accumulated an audience that included billionaires Jack Dorsey and Mark Cuban—and enmity from many of the people it skewered.</p><p><img src="https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png"><span>Abram Brown</span><span>Forbes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat(jpg)/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f4dbdc61f01affb0ae14e3e%2F0x0.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>That post is <em>mostly</em> accurate.

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>

<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>

<p>This summer I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 at PostgreSQL Global Development Group. During these 3 months, I was working on performance and safety features for <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g">WAL-G</a> utility. I went through this summer journey together with my mentors <a href="https://github.com/g0djan">Georgy Rylov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/x4m">Andrey Borodin</a>. In this post, I will mainly focus on the work done during the program.</p>



<p>WAL-G is a tool written in Go for backing up and restoring PostgreSQL clusters (most recently MySQL, MongoDB, and FoundationDB too). It supports Amazon S3 storages (and S3 compatible analogs, like Yandex Object Storage), as well as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Swift Object Storage, and the file system.</p>



<p>In its core functionality, WAL-G is a successor of WAL-E but written in Go. WAL-G works much faster than WAL-E and also has some new cool features, one of them is delta-backups. Delta-backup, whenever possible, stores only pages, changed since the previous backup. When a full recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last base backup plus all of the delta<em> </em>backups until the point of restoration.</p>



<p>The goal of the project was to make two enhancements:</p>



<p>The first one was to improve the performance of the backup fetch process by implementing delta-backups unpacking in reverse order to avoid rewriting the same pages along with the following backup structure reorganization to avoid downloading unnecessary files.</p>



<p>The second was to provide users with the features to verify backup consistency, such as WAL’s history consistency check and page checksum verification.</p>



<p>These two enhancements were implemented as four features:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#unpackreverse">Unpack delta-backups in reverse order</a></li><li><a href="#reorganizebackup">Reorganize backup structure to avoid downloading unnecessary files</a></li><li><a href="#walhistorycheck">WAL’s history consistency check</a></li><li><a href="#checksumverification">Page checksum verification</a></li></ul>



<p>All of the four features by now are merged into WAL-G master branch. You can try them by cloning the<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g"> WAL-G repo</a>.</p>



<h2 id="unpackreverse">Unpacking delta backups in reverse order</h2>



<p>When restoring from delta backup, WAL-G at first unpacks the oldest version of the page files from base backup and then applies delta backups to the base version in historical order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CSh90AC62ojlPE7uCv0Ms2xl-buHF--mp3qZ8mb6bCGeK3V7D-S_92aaOTHFBI0h6NuAZ6fCci8DdV__6_kwh2sfVrYGsYSE1FAdWhCiHO-HxV9rygxaJXR112AuT9ERexCQkMYt" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G default backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that there are page blocks in the older backup which are going to be completely overwritten by their version from the newer backup, thus resulting in unnecessary writes to disk. The main goal of this feature was to improve backup fetch performance by implementing an unpack of delta backups in reverse order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEyTQyTvj1VzFKlSO4Jd2FQW_xofm2TBKxnHXSyY7AN94SDPFDppYL6E7J4F7QFspmLTqoFIrSVJlGIdPT99aNOV0ABgiRoNPjAmH7upqLWHy6xE5JHB3KDnDjkbEeppyAXFRzvF" alt=""><figcaption>Reverse backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this approach, pages are written to the disk only once, which noticeably improves backup restore performance. The main idea was to create page files from the latest delta backup at first, then fill the missing information from the following delta backups and the base backup.</p>



<p>The following text describes how WAL-G creates the page file without unnecessary page overwrites. It will focus on the most non-trivial case when the page file was modified multiple times since the first appearance in the base backup. Other more trivial cases are omitted for briefness. The page file is restored using the following scheme:</p>



<ol><li>Create page file from delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the previous delta</li><li>…</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the first delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the base backup</li></ol>



<h4>Create page file from delta</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G3T7fENlEHMmJUn327j1rAPyO_dzHDMYj8b7UCi5fVuTs1r_BCiO2lADT4feALN5NHdeD28F5XBVFdi5_2GQwrPqS5IRw4jpzA-T5V6EBYUwoXGwqxi0NwJDl5Y1OjQLc_RBBRmd" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G increment file header</figcaption></figure>



<p>WAL-G uses the information from the header of the delta page file to extract the final size of the page file. Knowing the final size of the page file and the PostgreSQL page size, it is possible to calculate the page count needed to write on the disk. For each page WAL-G performs the following algorithm to write the pagefile:</p>



<ol><li>If this page exists in delta backup, write it to the page file</li><li>If this page does not exist in the delta, write an empty page block to the page file</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ov865hrbNync4w4GYeICfb4qU2q4elCY5xetoJ2fglJgSjORdAPW_ywlJmHJE2t3LXjhxFheOkZ-BKnBWkQGs8YcoogD9E-dR8aZS55TyIJq-4O9DBkW9RjTvq9VSRzwfwYi25ij" alt="" width="372" height="249"><figcaption>Structure of the created page file</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the N-th delta to the page file</h4>



<p>For each next delta, WAL-G needs to write only the missing information to the page files. For each page in N-th delta backup WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the page from delta</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qraIB_-HykTegsB2Hkuhf1GsyCcL_p8PWXYwQKzKeWC1zAQBaXA0jxa6t2WcKBycDR3zG51BZhdMBftYucTB0XB3QfXnCL9JT36FlrW9uUvV-a1zv7D6ujxt0NFKGwNvwOpdwoQq" alt=""><figcaption>Application of N-th delta to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the base backup to the page file</h4>



<p>After WAL-G reached the base backup, it needs to get the missing pages from the base backup page file version. For each page in the local page file WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the base backup page</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9lBoXoMFN54cDWH9GCyXVgz4k_VxHYG6xAhmude06gNmTrVF7tLHzIHOgXwNIXSJ3jgwuXjM8P4FjK9JraZSjOtdLC4J2U1Nkf_P7nvuU-dJJN35FsZqAITcr9NrTxBDTICWh7t_" alt=""><figcaption>Application of base backup to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve implemented the proposed approach and measured performance improvement. WAL-G with reverse delta unpack turned on demonstrated about 2.5x faster backup restore compared to the standard WAL-G. If you are interested in more details, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/benchmarks/reverse-delta-unpack-26-03-2020.md">complete benchmark report</a>.</p>

<ul><li>set the&nbsp;<code>WALG_USE_REVERSE_UNPACK</code> environment variable</li><li>add the <code>--reverse-unpack</code> flag:</li></ul>



<pre><code>wal-g backup-fetch /path LATEST --reverse-unpack</code></pre>

<h2 id="reorganizebackup">Reorganization of backup structure</h2>



<p>After the implementation of the reverse delta unpack feature disk load and overall performance during backup-fetch<strong> </strong>has been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, WAL-G still needed to download absolutely all backup files from the cloud. However, with the reverse delta unpack feature implemented it wasn’t longer necessary – for example, there may have been a situation when WAL-G already had a consistent local version (no missing page blocks) of each file in the archive that was going to be downloaded. In this case, the archive contained only outdated files that aren’t useful anyway, so WAL-G can skip the download of the entire archive and proceed to the next one. The goal was to avoid downloading these unnecessary archives from the cloud and improve the WAL-G backup fetch performance even more 🙂</p>



<p>WAL-G stores each backup in the cloud split into several compressed archives. The problem is that to check which files exist in the archive you need to download and decompress it from the storage. The main idea is quite simple – store the contents of each archive in a backup JSON sentinel file so WAL-G can skip the archives without interesting files without downloading them.</p>



<pre><code>{ // this is a sample backup sentinel JSON file 
  "PgVersion": 120002,
  "UncompressedSize": 500781396,
  "CompressedSize": 100243768,
  "LSN": 17448304680,
  "DeltaCount": 8,
  "DeltaFromLSN": 16743661608,
  "SystemIdentifier": 6847498813832237599,
  "DeltaFullName": "base_00000003000000030000002F",
  "TarFileSets": { // new field to store information of contents of each tar archive here
    "part_001.tar.lz4": [
      "/",
      "/base",
      "/base/1",
      "/base/13689",
      "/base/13690",
      "/base/16384",
      "/base/16384/1259",
      "/base/16384/16397",
...
    ],
    "part_003.tar.lz4": [
      "tablespace_map",
      "backup_label"
    ]
  },
  "Files": {...},
  "DeltaFrom": "base_0000000300000003000000E6_D_0000000300000003000000D6",
  "FinishLSN": 17448304952,
  "Spec": null
}</code></pre>



<p>We’ve successfully implemented this approach and now WAL-G stores the contents of each backup archive in backup sentinel JSON by default. However, with this approach, the case when all of the files in the archive can be skipped may be quite rare. For a file that is being updated frequently, there is a high chance that some delta backup will contain only outdated information about it that WAL-G won’t need. And vice versa, if some file is being updated rarely, there is a high chance that delta backup will still hold some required data so we can’t skip the archive containing this file and we need to download the entire archive.</p>



<p>That’s why we developed an additional backup creation mode (<code><code>rating composer</code></code>) based on file update ratings. The idea was to place the files with a similar update frequency in the same archives so we can get the higher chance of the entire archive to be skipped. WAL-G needed to somehow determine the update frequency for each file in the database cluster folder. Luckily, for paged files, there is information from Postgres statistics collector – particularly <code>n_tup_ins</code>, <code>n_tup_del</code>, <code>n_tup_upd</code> columns from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> view.</p>







<p>In the rating composer mode, during backup creation, for each file WAL-G calculates the updates count using the data from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> and stores it in the current backup sentinel JSON. If available, WAL-G also reads the <code>previousUpdatesCount</code> – previous updates count value from the previous backup sentinel JSON. Using these values WAL-G then calculates the <code>updateRating</code> for each file: <code>(currentUpdatesCount * 100) / previousUpdatesCount</code>. Finally, all that left to do is:</p>



<ol><li>Sort all the files in the current backup by their <code>updateRating</code></li><li>Start packing files into archive from the file with the highest update rating</li><li>When the size of the files packed in the current archive exceeds the <code>WALG_TAR_SIZE_THRESHOLD</code> limit, create the new archive, and go to step 2.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, seems like we’re done… But actually no. To speed up things a little bit, WAL-G can do concurrent packing of multiple tar archives during backup creation (<code>WALG_UPLOAD_DISK_CONCURRENCY</code> setting). If you look closely, the above algorithm can’t be parallelized in straightforward …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The complexity of cloud costs keeps increasing - When we were building PlanForCloud in 2012 AWS had just hit 10,000 different pricing points for their services - now there are over 300,000.</p>
<p>We found existing tools fit in too late in the process and are not aimed at the people in control of the infrastructure. It’s difficult to get cost estimations when you are building and deploying your services, which often leads to bill shock and no easy way to track down these costs. So we wanted to build a CLI tool that can plug into your existing development and operations processes and bring cost visibility to the engineers.</p>
<p>Currently Infracost supports AWS and Terraform, but we will add support for more cloud vendors (GCP, Azure) and other IaC tools (Pulumi).</p>
<p>We also want to go beyond just the baseline costs of infrastructure - data transfer costs and other usage-based costs can often be a significant portion of a cloud bill, and are also the hardest to predict and track down. If you have any ideas about the best way to handle these then please <a href="https://twitter.com/aliscott" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reach out to me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Infracost is open source, you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/aliscott/infracost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/aliscott/infracost</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

<div>
<p><img src="https://fastpages.fast.ai/images/copied_from_nb/fastcore_imgs/td.png" alt="screenshot with code"></p>
<p>I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn't seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find!  That's when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests?  I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what I did over the past month!  I'm pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I've ever experienced.  I've discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also <em>why the code works the way it does</em>, and to explore edge cases while writing tests.  Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible!  It turns out the library I choose, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is a library on top of which many <a href="https://github.com/fastai">fast.ai</a> projects are built on. Most importantly, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I'm going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:</strong>  I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages.</li>
<li><strong>You get a new set of pragmatic tools</strong>: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.</li>
<li><strong>Learn more about the Python programming language:</strong>  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Making-**kwargs-transparent">Making **kwargs transparent<a href="#Making-**kwargs-transparent"> </a></h2><p>Whenever I see a function that has the argument <strong>**kwargs</strong>, I cringe a little.  This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that <code>foo</code> also accepts and additional parameters <code>b</code> and <code>d</code>.  We can fix this with <code>delegates</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can customize the behavior of this decorator.  For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping <code>**kwargs</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude arguments.  For example, we exclude argument <code>d</code> from delegation:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also delegate between classes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes">Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes<a href="#Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes"> </a></h2><p>Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in <code>__init__</code>?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Ouch! That was painful.  Look at all the repeated variable names.  Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class?  Not Anymore!  Checkout <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">store_attr</a>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude certain attributes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>There are many more ways of customizing and using <code>store_attr</code> than I highlighted here.  Check out <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">the docs</a> for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate">Avoiding subclassing boilerplate<a href="#Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate"> </a></h2><p>One thing I hate about python is the <code>__super__().__init__()</code> boilerplate associated with subclassing.  For example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#PrePostInitMeta">PrePostInitMeta</a>.  We define a new class called <code>NewParent</code> that is a wrapper around the <code>ParentClass</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Type-Dispatch">Type Dispatch<a href="#Type-Dispatch"> </a></h2><p>Type dispatch, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">Multiple dispatch</a>, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives.  This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia.  For example, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">conceptual example</a> of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting spaceship</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting spaceship</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box.  Fortunately, there is the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html#typedispatch-Decorator">@typedispatch</a> decorator to the rescue.  This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function <code>f</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html">you can read about here</a>. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch">multipledispatch</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin">Mathhew Rocklin</a> (the creator of Dask).</p>
<p>After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p><code>functools.partial</code> is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= <code>val</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can create a new function out of this function using <code>partial</code> that sets the default value to 5:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One problem with <code>partial</code> is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Composition-of-functions">Composition of functions<a href="#Composition-of-functions"> </a></h2><p>A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result.  This is especially useful when applying various data transformations.  Consider a toy example where I have three functions:  (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>But why is this useful?  You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>arrsum</span><span>(</span><span>add2</span><span>(</span><span>filter5</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>])))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You are not wrong!  However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>For more information about <code>compose</code>, read <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#compose">the docs</a>.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="A-more-useful-__repr__">A more useful <code>__repr__</code><a href="#A-more-useful-__repr__"> </a></h2><p>In python, <code>__repr__</code> helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging.  Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using <code>store_attr</code>, which was discussed earlier).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can use <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#basic_repr">basic_repr</a> to quickly give us a more sensible default:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator">Monkey Patching With A Decorator<a href="#Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator"> </a></h2><p>It can be convenient to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/">monkey patch</a> with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing.  We can use the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#patch">decorator @patch</a> from <code>fastcore.foundation</code> along with type hints like so:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now, <code>MyClass</code> has an additional method named <code>func</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Still not convinced?  I'll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="A-better-pathlib.Path">A better pathlib.Path<a href="#A-better-pathlib.Path"> </a></h2><p>When you see <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">these extensions</a> to pathlib.path you won't ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Path.readlines</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.readlines()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.read</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.read()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.save</code>: saves file as pickle</li>
<li><code>Path.load</code>: loads pickle file</li>
<li><code>Path.ls</code>: shows the contents of the path as a list. </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">Read more about this here</a>.  Here is a demonstration of <code>ls</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Wait!  What's going on here?  We just imported <code>pathlib.Path</code> - why are we getting this new functionality?  Thats because we imported the <code>fastcore.foundation</code> module, which patches this module via the <code>@patch</code> decorator discussed earlier.  Just to drive the point home on why the <code>@patch</code> decorator is useful, I'll go ahead and add another method to <code>Path</code> right now:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>That is magical, right?  I know!  That's why I'm writing about it!</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>

<h2 id="An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas">An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas<a href="#An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas"> </a></h2><p><code>Self</code>, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object.  For example, let's create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can use <code>Self</code> in the same way:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Let's create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The above QR code contains a complete Windows executable that will run on Windows 7 and up. It's a simple but fully playable implementation of Snake.</p>
<p>A QR code is a data storage medium like any other, and while it's almost always used to store ASCII text, it can also be used to store binary data. As such, virtually any computer data can theoretically be stored in a QR code provided it can fit within the size limitations.</p>
<p>A QR code comes in various standard sizes, the largest being version 40 which can store up to 2,953 bytes (roughly 2.9 KB) of binary data. The above code is not quite that large, it's only storing around 1.4 KB of data (shrunk down from 3.2 KB with <a href="http://www.crinkler.net/" target="_blank">Crinkler</a>, slightly larger than the executable shown in the video because I decided to add a little more functionality).</p>

<p><b>Method 1: Webcam (automatic)</b></p>
<p>You can treat this QR code much like a QR code in the real world by using your computer's webcam to read it (e.g. after loading this page on a phone or printing the QR code out). For this, I recommend using zbarcam. I've included a download link with everything you need:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open "Read Snake From QR.bat". After a moment, your webcam will activate.</li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and Snake will appear, freshly read from the QR code.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Method 2: Webcam (manual)</b></p>
<p>This method is the same as the above, however if you'd rather input the commands manually than running my script, go for it:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
    <li><span>cd</span> to the zbarcam folder.</li>
    <li>Run the following command:
        <p>zbarcam --raw --oneshot -Sbinary &gt; snake.exe</p>
        <p>The arguments used are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>--raw</span> - Disables any character encoding conversion.</li>
            <li><span>--oneshot</span> - Stops reading and closes zbarcam after the code has been successfully read.</li>
            <li><span>-Sbinary</span> - Informs zbarcam that the data in the code is binary data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and an executable called "snake.exe" will appear in the same folder.</li>
    <li>Open "snake.exe".</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been patched to correctly output binary data on Windows. This project exposed a bug in zbarcam where binary data was incorrectly treated as text, inadvertently corrupting it as Windows attempted to convert LF line endings to CRLF. The fix used here has since been merged into zbar's master source code, but as of July 2020 no stable release version has included the fix yet.</li>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been compiled with DirectShow support for greater compatibility with webcam devices. In my video, I use a build that has not been compiled for DirectShow (using VfW instead) which leads to a black and white webcam feed. This build provides a feed in color.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote an implementation of Snake in JavaScript that, when minified, could also fit into the maximum QR code size which I briefly showcased in the video. Some people were interested in playing this, so <a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/snake-minified.html">it is available here</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm stepping down from Rust's core team. It's my last official involvement with Rust, and I'm kinda sad about leaving. Rust is exciting and important, and I love the community and technology. It has been a joy and an education to work with the core team; they are good people.</p><p>I stopped working full-time on Rust early in 2019 when I left Mozilla. I have been contributing as part of my work at PingCAP (big thank you for that support!) and in my own time, but have had much less time for the work than it deserves. My wife and I are expecting a second daughter any day now, and I think that will nuke my remaining spare time, and any availability I have left for Rust work. Good timing for me to make space on the core team, and to focus on my databases/distributed systems work.</p><p>I hope to remain active in the community, and hopefully next year, once things have settled down a bit at home, I can again contribute regularly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/content/images/2020/09/99312bc3-a432-415b-8366-9ad1eefd47bb.JPG" alt="Ultrasound image of my daughter"><figcaption>My next project, pre-launch</figcaption></figure>

<p>As an addendum on to our four-part look at the general structures of the farming of cereal grains (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">IV</a>) this post is going to briefly discuss some of the key ways that the structures of <strong><em>rice</em> <em>farming </em></strong>differ from the structures of wheat and barley farming.  We’ll start with some of the key differences in the mechanics of rice farming itself, before moving into how those differences might motivate different social and economic organization in the countryside, before finally discussing some of the theories as to how rice farming might – or might not – impact larger structures like the state.</p>

<p>(Quick bibliographic aside: I relied primary for this on Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (206 B.C. – A.D. 220) (1980) and F. Bray, <em>The Rice Economies: Technology and Development in Asian Societies </em>(1986) which were recommended to me by specialists in the field.  The latter is a wealth of technical details on rice cultivation, although it is as focused on the transition to mechanization and modern agriculture as to the conditions of pre-modern rice cultivation.)</p>



<h2>Rice Cultivation</h2>



<p>We want to start with the rice cultivation process.  There are a <em>lot</em> of varieties of rice out there, but the key divide we want to make early is between dry-rice and wet-rice.  When we’re talking about ‘rice cultures’ or ‘rice agriculture,’ generally, we mean wet-rice farming, where the rice is partially submerged during its growing.  Wild rice, as far as we can tell, began as a swamp-grass and thus likes to have quite a lot of water around, although precisely controlling the water availability can lead the rice to be a lot more productive than it would be in its natural habitat.  While there are varieties of rice which can be (and are) farmed ‘dry’ (that is, in unflooded fields much like wheat and barley are farmed), the vast majority of rice farming is ‘wet.’  As with grains, this is not merely a matter of different methods of farming, but of different varieties of rice that have been adapted to that farming; varieties of dry-rice and wet-rice have been selectively bred over millennia to perform best in those environments.</p>



<p>Wet-rice is farmed in paddies, small fields (often <em>very</em> small – some Chinese agronomists write that the ideal size for an individual rice field is around 0.1 hectare, which is just 0.24 acres) surrounded by low ‘bunds’ (small earthwork walls or dykes) to keep in the water, typically around two feet high.  Because controlling the water level is crucial, rice paddies must be very precisely flat, leading to even relatively gentle slopes often being terraced to create a series of flat fields.  Each of these rice paddies (and there will be many because they are so small) are then connected by irrigation canals which channel and control the water in what is often a quite complex system.</p>

<p>The exact timing of rice production is more complex than wheat because a single paddy often sees two crops in a year and the exact planting times vary between areas;  one common cycle on the Yangtze is for a February planting (with a June harvest) followed by a June planting (with a November harvest).  In other areas, paddies planted with rice during the first planting might be drained and sown with a different plant entirely (sometimes including wheat) in the intervening time.</p>



<p>The cycle runs thusly: after the heavy rains of the monsoons (if available), the field is tilled (or plowed, but as we’ll see, manual tillage is often more common).  The seed is then sown (or transplanted) and the field is, using the irrigation system, lightly flooded, so that the young seedlings grow in standing water.  Sometimes the seed is initially planted in a dedicated seed-bed and then transferred to the field, rather than being sown there directly; doing so has a positive impact on yields, but is substantially more labor intensive.  The water level is raised as the plant grows; agian this is labor intensive, but increases yields.  Just before the harvest the fields are drained out and allowed to dry out, before the crop is harvested and then goes into processing.</p>



<p>Rice is threshed much like grain (more often manually threshed and generally not threshed with flails) to release the seeds, the individual rice grains, from the plant.  That is going to free the endosperm of the speed, along with a hull around it and a layer of bran between the two.  Hulling was traditionally done by hand-pounding, which frees the seed from the hull, leaving just the endosperm and some of the bran; this is how you get <em>brown</em> rice, which is essentially ‘whole-grain’ rice.  While it is generally less <em>tasty</em>, the bran actually has quite a lot of nutrients not present in the calorie-rich endosperm.  Whereas <em>white rice</em> is produced by then milling or polishing away the bran to produce a pure, white kernal of the endosperm; it is very tasty, but lacks many of the vitamins that brown rice has.</p>



<p>Consequently, while a diet of mostly brown rice can be healthy, a diet overwhelmingly of <em>white rice</em> leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine_deficiency">Thiamine deficiency</a>, known colloquially as <em>beriberi</em>.  My impression from the literature is that this wasn’t as much an issue prior to the introduction of mechanical milling processes for rice. Mechanical milling made producing white rice in quantity cheap and so it came to dominate the diet to the exclusion of brown rice, producing negative health effects for the poor who could not afford to supplement their rice-and-millet diet with other foods, or for soldiers whose ration was in rice.  But prior to that mechanical milling, brown rice was all that was available for the poor, which in turn meant less Thiamine deficiency among the lower classes of society.</p>



<h2>Farmer Terrain</h2>



<p>Because rice is such a different crop than wheat or barley, there are a lot of differences in the way that rice cultivation shapes the countryside.  We’ll move here from the relatively direct impacts on the organization of farmers and then discuss the more speculative impacts on the organization of whole societies.</p>



<p>The thing to note about <strong>rice is that it is both <em>much</em> more productive on a per-acre basis than wheat or barley, but also <em>much</em> more labor intensive</strong>; it also relies on different forms of capital to be productive.  Whole-grain wheat and brown rice have similar calorie and nutritional value (brown rice is somewhat better in most categories) on a unit-weight basis (so, per pound or ton), but the yield difference is fairly large: rice is typically around (very roughly) 50% more productive per acre than wheat.  Moreover, rice plants have a more favorable ratio of seeds-to-plants, meaning that the demand to put away seeds for the next harvest is easier – whereas crop-to-seed ratios on pre-modern wheat range from 3:1 to 10:1, rice can achieve figures as high as 100:1.  As a result, not only is the gross yield higher (that is, more tons of seed per field) but a lower percentage of that seed has to be saved for the next planting.</p>

Of particular note is how small each individual field is (compare the village on the right-hand side!).</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the same time, the irrigation demands for effective production of wet-rice requires a <em>lot</em> of labor to build and maintain</strong>.  Fields need to be flooded and drained; in some cases (particularly pre-modern terrace farming) this may involve moving the water manually, in buckets, from lower fields to higher ones.  Irrigation canals connecting paddies can make this job somewhat easier, as can bucket-lifts (there’s a picture of a simple one below), but that still demands moving quite a lot of water.  In any irrigation system, the bunds need to be maintained and the water level carefully controlled, with also involves potentially quite a lot of labor.</p>



<p>The consequence of all of this is that while the rice farming household seems to be roughly the same size as the wheat-farming household (that is, an extended family unit of variable size, but typically around 8 or so members), <strong>the farm is much smaller</strong>, with common household farm sizes, even in the modern period, clustering around 1 hectare (2.47 acres) in comparison to the standard household wheat farms clustered around 4-6 acres (which, you may note with the yield figures above, lands us right back at around the same subsistence standard).</p>



<p>Moreover, rice cultivation is less soil dependent (but more water dependent) because wet-rice farming both encourages nitrogen fixation in the soil (maintaining the fertility of it generally without expensive manure use) and because rice farming leads naturally to a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podzol">pozdolisation</a>, slowly converting the underlying soil over a few years to a set of characteristics which are more favorable for more rice cultivation.  So whereas with wheat cultivation, where you often have clumps of marginal land (soil that is too wet, too dry, too rocky, too acidic, too uneven, too heavily forested, and so on), rice cultivation tends to be able to make use of almost any land where there is sufficient water (although terracing may be needed to level out the land).  The reliance on the rice itself to ‘terraform’ its own fields does mean that new rice fields tended to under-produce for the first few years.</p>

				<p>When it comes to modern web application development, MongoDB is the king. If you are a full stack programmer, you hear about MERN or MEAN stacks every day. The <b>M</b> is in every one of them and it stands for MongoDB. The free and open source community version of MongoDB powers a large number of Web applications. From its humble beginnings in 2007, MongoDB has come a long way. It is the primary product behind the company MongoDB Inc. with over 10 billion dollars in market capitalisation. Like many other products before and after, online advertising was the key catalyst behind the vision and development of MongoDB. The story of MongoDB is an interesting one and in this article, I will take you on a journey through the MongoDB land and its history.</p>
<h2>The Idea of the Humongous Database – The Beginnings</h2>
<p>The story of MongoDB has its beginnings much earlier than 2007. In 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Merriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Merriman</a> and Kevin O’Connor created the famous online advertising company DoubleClick. Kevin Ryan joined the team soon after(Dwight and Kevin later cofounded 5 companies together – Gilt, 10gen, Panther Express, ShopWiki and Business Insider). DoubleClick soon took off and within a few years it was serving as much as 400,000 ads/second. Such large scale traffic was not anticipated by the relational database technologies available at that time. Configuring relational databases for such scale also required substantial amount of money and hardware resources. So Dwight(who was the CTO at the time) and his team wrote custom database implementations to scale DoubleClick for the increased traffic. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early talks on MongoDB</a>, Dwight talks about getting a network hardware with serial number 7 and wondering whether it will work! This was even before the invention of load balancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-people.jpg" width="300px" alt="People behind MongoDB" title="People behind MongoDB">In 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Horowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliot Horowitz</a> joined DoubleClick R&amp;D division as a software engineer immediately after his college. Within 2 years he left DoubleClick to start ShopWiki along with Dwight. Both of them realised that they were solving the same horizontal scalability issues again and again. So in 2007, Dwight, Eliot and Kevin Ryan started a new company called 10gen. 10gen was focused on creating a PaaS hosting solution with its own application and database stack. 10gen soon got the attention of the venture capitalist Albert Wenger (Union Square Ventures) and he invested $1.5 million into it. This is what <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2008/07/10gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Wenger wrote in 2008 about the 10gen investment</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen. They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service. The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby. The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Albert was refering to as “the database with interesting design” was in fact MongoDB. Rapid development on the new database was undertaken from 2007 to 2009. The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e73188b5512c82290a4070af4afddac20d0b981e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first commit of the MongoDB database server by Dwight can be seen here</a>. The core engine was written in C++. The database was named MongoDB since the idea was to use it to store and serve humongous amount of data required in typical use cases such as content serving. Initially the team had only 4 engineers(including Dwight and Eliot) and decided to focus just on the MongoDB database instead of the initial PaaS product. The business idea was to release the database as an open source free download and offer commercial support and training services on top of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB 1.0 was released</a> in February 2009. The initial version focused on providing a usable query language with document model, indexing and basic support for replication. It also had experimental version of sharding, but production ready sharding clusters were available only in version 1.6 released a year later.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongodb-user/X0Le3mBel2I/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Dwight responded to a question</a> on the suitability of Mongo for a highly scalable system (MongoDB user group – September 2009),</p>
<blockquote><p>
For horizontal scaling, one would use auto-sharding to build out large MongoDB clusters.  This is in alpha now, but if your project is just getting started, it will be in production by the time you need it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Early MongoDB Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the early years, the basic design principles behind MongoDB development were the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data model for faster programming – document model with CRUD.</li>
<li>Use of familiar language and format – JavaScript/JSON.</li>
<li>Schema less documents for agile iterative development.</li>
<li>Only essential features for faster development and easy scaling. No join, no transactions across collections.</li>
<li>Support easy horizontal scaling and durability/availability (replication/sharding).</li>
</ul>
<p>In his ZendCon 2011 presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOQJpGu1kY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“NoSQL and why we created MongoDB”</a>, Dwight talks about these principles in detail. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=2408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 minutes mark</a>, there is also an interesting discussion on the difference between replication and sharding. As the database server code matured and once MongoDB hit the mainstream, many of these principles were obviously diluted. Latest MongoDB server versions support joining to some extend and since MongoDB 4.2, even distributed transactions are supported!</p>
<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>Before we get into detailed MongoDB history and how it evolved over the years, let us briefly look at what exactly it is!</p>
<p>MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database. It can run on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and the open source version is available as a free download. MongoDB stores data entities in a container called collection and each piece of data stored is in a JSON document format. For example, if a customer submits an online order, the entire details of that order (order number, order line items, delivery address etc.) are kept in a single hierarchical document in JSON format. It is then saved to a collection named “customer_order”.</p>
<p>MongoDB also comes with a console client called MongoDB shell. This is a fully functional JavaScript environment using which you can add, remove, edit or query document data in the database.</p>
<h2>MongoDB Architecture</h2>
<p>The following MongoDB architecture diagram provides a high level view of the major components in the MongoDB server.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-architecture.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB Architecture Diagram" title="MongoDB Architecture Diagram"></p>
<p>MongoDB currently offers <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers for 13 languages</a> including Java, Node.JS, Python, PHP and Swift. The storage engine MMAPv1 is removed since version 4.2. The encrypted storage engine is only supported in the commercial enterprise server.</p>
<p>The beauty of MongoDB is that using the same open source free community server you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a simple single machine instance suitable for most small applications.</li>
<li>Run a multi-machine instance with durability/high availability suitable for most business applications.</li>
<li>Run a large horizontally scaled cluster of machines(shard cluster) handling both very large sets of data and high volume of query traffic. MongoDB provides automatic infrastructure to distribute both data and its processing across machines. A typical use case would be running a popular ad service with thousands of customers and millions of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagrams show various options available for running MongoDB instances.</p>
<h2>Single Server/Fault Tolerant Setup</h2>
<p>For small applications, a single server setup is enough with frequent data backups. For installations that require fault tolerance, a replica set implementation can be done. In the fault tolerant deployment, usually there are 3 or more MongoDB instances. Only one of them work as the primary instance and if it fails, one of the other 2 secondaries takes over as the primary. The data is identical in all instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment1.jpg" width="800px" alt="Single server/fault tolerant setup" title="Single server/fault tolerant setup"></p>
<h2>Shard Cluster for Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>For a large database with both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance requirements, a MongoDB shard cluster is configured. As can be seen from the diagram below, minimum recommended number of machines for a fault tolerant shard cluster is 14! Each fault tolerant replica set in this case handles only a subset of the data. This data partitioning is automatically done by MongoDB engine.<br>
<img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment2.jpg" width="800px" alt="Shard cluster with partitioned data" title="Shard cluster with partitioned data"></p>
<p>When you download the latest version of MongoDB (4.4) and extract it, you will find that it contains only the following 3 main files,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mongo</b> – MongoDB shell for interacting with your server using JavaScript based commands.</li>
<li><b>mongod</b> – The MongoDB main executable. This can run as a single database instance, as a database member of a sharded cluster or as a configuration server of a sharded cluster.</li>
<li><b>mongos</b> – A router application only needed for sharded horizontally scaled cluster of database servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mac machine, the total size of these 3 executables is around 150MB. These are the only components you need for any type of MongoDB deployments! In a world of bloated software, this is a welcome change! This simplicity and elegance is what makes MongoDB so powerful and reliable.</p>
<h2>Evolution of MongoDB (2009 to 2020)</h2>
<p>MongoDB 1.0 was released in February 2009 and it had most of the basic query functionalities. MongoDB 1.2 was released in December 2009 and it introduced large scale data processing using map-reduce. Realising that MongoDB has good potential, 10gen quickly ramped up the team. MongoDB 1.4 (March 2010) introduced background index creation and MongoDB 1.6 (August 2010) introduced some major features such as production ready sharding for horizontal scaling, replica sets with automatic failover and IPv6 support.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-timeline1.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB 2009 to 2013" title="MongoDB 2009 to 2013"></p>
<p>By 2012, 10gen had 100 employees and the company started providing 24/7 support. MongoDB 2.2 release(August 2012) introduced aggregation pipeline enabling multiple data processing steps as a chain of …</p></div></div>

Having spent a lot of my childhood in Cornwall and still returning to this day, I always take the chance to get out on the water.</p><p>Obviously waves are powerful things, but there is more to their power than meets the eyes and I wanted to explore their true power.</p><p>A wave breaks when it wants, it is as powerful as it wants, the wave couldn’t care less if you’re riding it or not. There is no controlling it. It’s just you responding and reacting to the wave. Your reaction is all you can control. This creates a connection, a relationship between you and the water. One that you are a part of, but just to observe and react, all you can do is do your best and the wave will do its own thing. This connection is natural and raw, just you and the elements, nothing else is interfering or interrupting.</p><p>This connection with what’s around you and the earth, as you are riding the wave to the shore, also forms with fellow surfers riding the wave. Enjoying that same moment and experience, unique in many ways.</p><p>Nothing else is in the way or is there to disturb or interrupt you, there is a indisputable focus on the present. As if time is slowing down, watching the colours, ripples and feeling the undercurrent, strength and force of the wave. Lots of this happens subconsciously but this focus on the present can be hard to replicate elsewhere.</p><p>Waves are continuous, if you miss one, another is on the horizon. If you mess it up, then you can try again on the next. You just do your best and keep at it. There is something liberating about the idea you can just try again the next day and that’s ok. No pressure, limit or finiteness.</p><p>The artistic nature of the waves swirling, building and crashing is beautiful to watch, especially up close. It’s as if the movement has emotion, yet is unaware and not caring of what’s in front. As if it has a mind of it’s own.</p><p>The true power of waves is more than just the force of the water then.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, <a href="https://www.mattswain.co.uk/newsletter">sign up to my newsletter </a>for more ideas,  thoughts and insights into thinking without limits. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Imagine a computer-based system visualizing your thoughts and secret thoughts; yes, it's possible now by artificial intelligence assistance. Recent advancements in hardware innovation have re-energized technology. It becomes more accurate, authentic, can produce better sound, accurate visualization, and understanding of the location. Outstanding computer processors support computer to make a decision, plan outputs and don't repeat the mistake as they learn from it. The four scientists in Kyoto at Kyoto University did an exceptional experiment that exceeds the global expectations about such a dreamy truth. </p><p>Tomoyasu Horikawa, Guohua Shen, Yukiyasu Kamitani, and Kei Majima recently published their <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf">results in a paper </a>on a scientific research platform &nbsp;BioRxiv. They have done their experiment in ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. Their study mainly exposes the decoding of human thoughts using an artificially intelligent system. &nbsp;The artificial intelligence system becomes so smart and real to duplicate human minds and show what they're thinking in their minds. &nbsp;Now scientists are successful in developing the next phase of AI machine, which uses human psychology. It is a leading technology from science fiction to merely science phenomena.</p><p>Below video is demonstration of Tomoyasu’s work. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrO1v7-KcXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-is-helping-human-beings"><a href="https://thinkml.ai/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-common-people/">Machine Learning is helping human beings</a> </h3><p>Machine learning is in use since many years ago in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. It helped generate a visual impact of human thinking in the form of binary mages or geographic shapes. The images obtained are of simple shapes or pixels. However, another prediction that the human brain thinks in unique patterns of image creation; different thinking levels, either with simple or complex components.</p><p>The idea of processing human thoughts is not new as we can see 1950s videos where doctors used to put contraptions on the human brain. It helps them to decipher the thoughts always running in their patient's minds. A British Serial <strong>Quatermass and the Pit </strong>shows a similar technique to translate the alien's thoughts.</p><p>The scientists from the United States, China, and Japan utilize this fantasy to change it into reality. They use <strong>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </strong>strategy for better measurement of brain activity. The deep neural networks involved in replicating human brain functioning procedure.</p><h3 id="the-emergence-of-artificial-people-with-machine-learning-system">The emergence of Artificial People with Machine Learning System</h3><p>Machines come with consciousness and result in developing a direct relationship between humans and machines. The day is coming when robots not only talk but can laugh, fight, and be cruel with the power of advancement in technology. Some research laboratories are busy making a force that can sense its surrounding environment and show response according to it. They sense human thoughts running in their minds and visualize to others. It's beneficial to know and see the thoughts of those quality people who are extraordinary but can't speak.</p><p>Alan Turing said:</p><blockquote>‘’If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, it is as intelligent as a human being.’’</blockquote><h3 id="is-it-telepathy-or-something-advanced">Is it Telepathy or Something Advanced?</h3><p>The whole world is excited about the news of AI reading minds, but the reality is somewhat not as same as appearing to us. Machine learning is still unable to detect rightly what we think, feel, desire, wish, or need at a specific time. The science is aiming to decipher the images that subjects see for a period. Thus, machine learning uses a reconstruction of a visual filed algorithm for a visual demonstration of thoughts.</p><p>In the last years, scientists strive to create a system that can judge images based on their shapes, characters, and letters when a subject’s mind view them.</p><h3 id="kyoto-university-research-by-four-scientists">Kyoto University Research by Four Scientists</h3><p>The advances in the development of artificial intelligence also use a <strong>deep neural network </strong>to decode human thoughts. &nbsp;They aimed to develop a method that not only deciphers the images but also regenerate the same one. Therefore, the four efficient scientists at Kyoto University utilized the BioRxiv platform and <strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN)</strong> as a proxy to share their findings of thought decoding. These neural systems help decode images of thoughts in the human brain and produce a visual prediction that resembles a person's thinking.</p><p>More generalized; the system should visualize the image about which its system is not trained previously after decoding the thoughts. &nbsp;It can see or covert human thoughts into images.</p><h3 id="how-does-ai-can-visualize-our-thinking-process">How Does AI Can Visualize our Thinking Process? </h3><p>The basis of this system is to scan the human brain deeply. For this purpose, the scientists introduce fMRI (Functional MRI) that scans the brain's core over traditional MRI that involves only monitoring brain activity. The unusual behavior of fMRI is its ability to track <strong>blood flow </strong>to the brain and <strong>brainwaves. </strong></p><p>It takes data from the scan and interprets what the subject was thinking when data was taken from it? The actual decoding occurs in the <strong>complex neural network </strong>that converts data into image format. But the humans have to rain the system first to get-go everything. They train the machine about the human brain thinking strategy that how it works and make a solution. It gets information from blood flow as it tracks blood's path, way, direction, and speed to reach the brain.</p><p>After it, the system starts producing images related to the information it gets by tracking blood flow. The process is only possible if the system comes with multilayers of <strong>deep neural networks. DNN</strong>involves the processing of information in image form. The information is then carried towards <strong>Deep Generator Network (DGN) Algorithm, </strong>which finally creates the image with high precision and accuracy. If we obtain images without using DGN, we can't get a high resolution or clear images of a different thought. DGN captures faces, eyes, and textual patterns and produces high-quality visual clues. With an efficient DGN algorithm, efficiency can be exceeded to 99%, and highly matching decoded images are obtained.</p><h3 id="the-methodology-of-the-experiment-deep-image-reconstruction">The methodology of the Experiment; Deep Image Reconstruction</h3><p>In simple words, the system consists of two necessary steps:</p><p>1. &nbsp;A subject sees an image, and the same image is shown to the AI system; thus, it can recreate its image.<br>2. &nbsp;After it, the subject’s brain thinks about that image, and AI recreates the same image by showing real-time response.</p><p>The scientists selected three subjects and showed them natural geometric shapes, artificial images, and other objects of varying characters. They repeated the same exposure of showing objects in varying periods for almost ten weeks and recorded their brainwaves. In <strong>experiment number one</strong>, they recorded the brain activity of the subject when seeing the particular object out of 25. In contrast, they measured brain activity by hiding the image and asked the brain to think about it (<strong>experiment number 2</strong>). </p><p>In both scenarios, they recorded the image created by artificial intelligence and then compared them to get staggering results. The filtered data is considered as a template of sorts. Then they used a decoder to identify the images via fMRI. They scanned brain activity and used the reverse-engineered method to produce an image of information obtained from thoughts. The scientists enabled <strong>deep learning networks </strong>to understand the brainwaves and decode its information to get output.</p><p>AI is so fast as it has the power of guessing about a particular problem. It asks and answers its questions at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="ai-visualizing-static-thoughts">AI Visualizing Static Thoughts </h3><p>Results were outstanding as the computer reconstructed that image but with low accuracy. The quality of images in both experiments was fizzy and comparatively low in the second experiment case. The reason was that it's difficult for a brain to remember an image as identical as it is. It enables scientists to decode ''hieratical'' images with various colors, pixels, and formations. The system establishes, for instance, can predict a picture of a bird, a plant, or an animal. Technology goes on proceeding towards refinement for better implementation of a particular process. </p><h3 id="statement-of-kamitani-about-the-project">Statement of Kamitani About the Project</h3><p>Kamitani was excited about their mutual hard work and getting mind-blowing results. He talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>as:</p><blockquote>‘’We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person sees just by looking at its brain activity. Our previous method was to suppose that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.''</blockquote><blockquote>'These neural networks or AI models can be used as a proxy for the human brain's hierarchical structure,' he added more. </blockquote><h3 id="ai-decoding-videos-you-re-watching-from-your-brain-activity">AI Decoding Videos You’re Watching from Your Brain Activity</h3><p>There is another group of scientists who published their research on ‘<strong>’Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision’’ </strong>in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>. They developed deep learning algorithms to scan the human brain and its working principles to decode its information.</p><p>Their experiment was based on three women who watched videos of hundreds of unique categories for several hours, and the scientists recorded their brain activity. The videos were on birds, airplanes, and other related objects. They obtained images from a popular Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision. The scientists used a functional MRI machine that measures signals of activity in the visual cortex. As the women watched several clips, the deep learning algorithms predicted activity closely related to the actual brain activity. Dozens of brain parts respond to a specific thought; thus, the artificial system mimics natural brain working strategies and shows visible results. </p><p>It also helped scientists to recognize which part of the cortex is involved in thought …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Dijkstra famously dissed testing by saying “Program testing can be used to show
the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”
As if you should choose one over the other.
I don’t see them as opposites but as complementary techniques that
should both be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of formal verification.
Formal verification tools can be the best bug-finding tools you have
ever used.
And they can completely eliminate entire classes of bugs from your code.
But, formal verification won’t find bugs in your
specification; or in your assumptions about your dependencies; or in your
build/CI harness, etc. (See <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/fonseca:ecs:2017">Fonseca</a> for more examples
of where testing has found bugs in formally verified systems.)</p>

<p>And, we all reluctantly agree that Dijkstra was right: even a thorough,
perfectly executed test plan can miss bugs.</p>

<p>So, for the last few months, I have been trying to have both.
We (my team and I at Google) have been reimplementing Jason Lingle’s
<a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest">proptest</a> property-testing library for use with Rust formal verification tools.
The original proptest lets you write test harnesses to test that your code
(probably) satisfies properties.
Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">a reimplementation of the proptest interface</a>
that enables you to use exactly the same test harnesses to
formally verify that the properties hold.
So far, we have only tried this with the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a>
but our implementation is based on the verification
interface used in <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/">verification competitions</a> so it should be
possible to port our library to many other verification tools.<sup id="fnref:for-Rust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:for-Rust">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[Before I go any further, I should mention that what we are <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">releasing this
week</a> is a very early research prototype.  It is not ready for serious use
and it is definitely not an official, supported Google product.  We are
releasing it now, in its current, immature state because we want to have
a conversation about how programmers want to formally verify Rust code
and we think that it is helpful to have something to push against.
We welcome pull requests that add support for other verifiers, or that
push the design in a better direction.]</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proptest-test-harness">A proptest test harness</h2>

<p>To get an idea for what property testing looks like in <code>proptest</code>,
we’ll look at an example from the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">proptest book</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_add(a in 0..1000i32, b in 0..1000i32) {
        let sum = add(a, b);
        assert!(sum &gt;= a);
        assert!(sum &gt;= b);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example defines a property called <code>test_add</code> that tests a function called
<code>add</code>.  In particular, it checks that, for non-negative values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the
result of <code>sum(a, b)</code> is at least as large as <code>a</code> and as <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The notation <code>0..1000i32</code> represents the set of all values in the range <code>[0 ..
1000)</code> and the notation <code>a in 0..1000i32</code> says that a value <code>a</code> should be
chosen from that set.</p>

<p>The <code>proptest!</code> macro converts this property into a test function
that repeatedly generates random values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and executes the
body of the property.</p>

<p>(After adding in <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">some additional glue code</a>) we can run this example with the command</p>



<p>which produces the following output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, if we deliberately write a property that doesn’t hold, then <code>cargo test</code>
produces output more like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

---- test_add stdout ----
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'Test failed: assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100; minimal failing input: a = 0, b = 0
        successes: 0
        local rejects: 0
        global rejects: 0
', src/main.rs:7:1


failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="verifying-with-propverify">Verifying with propverify</h2>

<p>Proptest checks the above property by generating random values and testing.
But we can also interpret the property as saying that for all values
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the sets, the body of the property will not panic.
That is, we can interpret it as a universally quantified specification.</p>

<p>To verify the above property, we use a script that compiles the Rust
code, invokes the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a> and filters
the output of KLEE to determine whether there is any choice of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> that can cause the body of the property to panic.</p>



<p>This produces output like this: confirming that the property does hold</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Running 1 test(s)
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed
VERIFICATION_RESULT: VERIFIED
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, if we change the example property so that the property does not hold,
<code>cargo-verify</code> produces this output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9

running 1 test
  Value a = 0
  Value b = 0
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On this example, random testing and formal verification produced similar
results.
I could have chosen an example where formal verification found a bug that
random testing misses.
Or I could have chosen an example where random testing easily finds
a bug but formal verification spins forever.
But, in this post, I wanted to focus on the similarity between the two
approaches, not the differences.</p>

<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>

<p>In this article, we used an example that was easy to explain but
does not really show off the power of <code>propverify</code>.
Some slightly better examples are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/compatibility-test/src/collections.rs#L60">collections.rs</a>
where we check properties involving standard Rust collection
types such as vectors and B-trees.
(This should be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/collection/index.html">proptest
documentation</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/0a6a0ff2b3880eb4a19d8161bfae8d163b0a65ec/compatibility-test/src/dynamic.rs#L82">dynamic.rs</a>
where we check properties involving trait objects by
quantifying over a subset of the possible instances of the trait.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, we have more documentation about</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-propverify.md">Using the propverify library</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-annotations.md">Using the lower level <code>verification-annotations</code> API</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-klee.md">The many, many flags we use when compiling Rust code so that it can be verified with KLEE</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two are mostly for the benefit of verification tool developers.</p>

<h2 id="our-next-steps">Our next steps</h2>

<p><em>[You can either read this as a sketch of what we plan to do or
as an admission of what we have not yet done.
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Fred and Ginger said</a>,
“Tomato. Tomato.”]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tools have a horrifically complicated set of dependencies.</p>

    <p>This is partly because formal verification is not quite popular
enough for enough Debian/Homebrew packages to exist and partly
because we need some very specific versions.
(It may also be possible to remove some dependencies!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-verifier">Crux-MIR</a> support to the library
and tool.
Crux-MIR is a new part of Galois’
<a href="https://galois.com/project/software-analysis-workbench/">Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)</a>
that verifies the MIR code generated by the Rust compiler.</p>

    <p>This is taking us a bit longer than using KLEE
because the functionality of our <code>cargo-verify</code> script
overlaps with the functionality of Crux-MIR but they have slightly different
approaches – we’re still working on the best way to handle the resulting
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to focus our attention on a single crate at a time.
We have some ideas for how to do that with fuzzing and verification
but we have not had a chance to try them yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not looked seriously at how well this approach scales.</p>

    <p>The collections support in the <code>propverify</code> library has a few
tricks to avoid some obvious scaling issues, but we don’t know if
those tricks work well for all verification tools and they
probably only scratch the surface of what needs to be done.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing and formal verification are usually portrayed as mortal enemies.
I think that misses a huge opportunity to use your existing familiarity and
comfort with testing to let you get value out of formal verification tools.</p>

<p>I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">our library and tool</a>,
try it out and give us feedback.
If you are working on a Rust verification tool, we would love it
if you tried to use our library with your tool.
And we would love it even more if you sent us a pull request.</p>

<p>It’s probably not a good idea to commit to using the library at this stage:
it is not very robust at the moment and I expect that it will change a lot
as we gain experience from porting the library to other types of
formal verification tools.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<section>
			<p>When we are storing data, we typically assume that our storage system of choice returns that data later just as we put it in.
However what guarantees do we have that this is actually the case?
The case made here is the case of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-bit-rot-and-how-can-i-detect-it-rhel">bitrot</a>, the silent degradation of the physical charges that physically make up today’s storage devices.</p>
<p>To counter this type of problem, one can employ data checksumming, as it is done by both btrfs and ZFS.
However, while in the long run btrfs might be the tool of choice for this, it is fairly complex and not yet too mature, whereas ZFS, the most prominent candidate for this type of features, is <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/8314">not</a> <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/">without</a> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/zfs-licensing-and-linux">hassle</a> and it must be recompiled for every kernel update (although <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Custom-Packages">automation exists</a>).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we’ll therefore take a look into a storage design that actually checks whether the returned data is actually valid and not silently corrupted inside our storage system and is completely designed with components available in Linux itself without the need to recompile and test your storage layer on every kernel upgrade.
We find that this storage design, while fulfilling the same purpose as ZFS, does not only yield comparable performance, but actually in some cases even able to significantly outperform it, as the benchmarks at the end indicate.</p>

<p>The system we will test in the following will be constructed from four components (including the filesystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dm-integrity</strong> provides blocklevel checksumming for all incoming data and will check said checksum for all data read through it (and return a read error if it doesn’t match).</li>
<li><strong>mdraid</strong> provides redundancy if a disk misbehaves, avoiding data loss. If the dm-integrity-layer detects invalid data from the disk, mdraid will see a read-error and can immediately correct this error by reading it from somewhere else in the redundancy pool.</li>
<li><strong>dm-crypt</strong> on top of the RAID, right below the filesystem will encrypt the data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>ext4</strong> as a filesystem to actually store files on it</li>
</ul>
<p>The order matters, dm-integrity must be placed between the harddisks and the mdraid, to ensure that data corruption errors can be corrected by mdraid after they have been detected by dm-integrity. Similarly, dm-crypt has nothing to do with redundancy, therefore it should be placed on top of of mdraid, to only having to be passed once, and not multiple times as it would be the case for placing it alongside dm-integrity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This yields the following storage design:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Storage system architecture</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture of the storeage system. Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems.

Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems. The encryption layer will later be ommitted when comparing performance to ZFS.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/mkstorage.sh.txt">This script will assemble the above depicted system and mount it to /mnt.</a></p>

<p>Now that we have an assembled system, we’d like to quantify the performance impact of the different layers.
The test setup for this is a <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Kobol Helios4</a> (primarily because it’s the intended target platform for this storage system) with four disks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> running Debian 10 “Buster”.
The Helios4 is powered by an energy efficient dual-core ARM SoC optimized for storage systems.
The setup was not built based on the entire disks, but on partitions of a size of 10GiB each, allowing multiple parallel designs and therefore easing the benchmarking procedure, as well as speeding up the experiments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="layer-analysis-of-performance-impact">Layer analysis of performance impact</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>To benchmark throughput, the following commands were used:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=8000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure was repeated ten times for proper statistics for the different cases for both read (<code>r</code>) and write (<code>w</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4 filesystem only (<code>f</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>encryption, topped by ext4 (<code>cf</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>mdraid (RAID6/double parity), topped by the former (<code>rcf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
<li>the final setup, including integrity (<code>ircf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layers.svg" alt="Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see different interesting results in the data:
First of all, the encryption engine on the helios4 is not completely impact free, although the resulting performance is still more than sufficient for the designated uses for a Helios4.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see that adding integrity layer does have a noticable impact on writing, but a negligible impact on reading, indicating that especially for systems primarily intended to read data from adding the integrity layer is a matter of negligible cost.</p>
<p>For write-heavy systems, the performance impact is more considerable, but for certain workloads, such as the home-NAS-case the Helios is designed for, the performance can still be considered fully sufficient, especially as normally the system would cache those writes to a certain extend, which was explicitly disabled for benchmarking purposes (see <code>conv=fdatasync</code> in the benchmark procedure).</p>
<p>The reason for the degradation in write (but not in read) is likely due to the fact that the integrity layer and the mdraid layer are decoupled from one another, the raid-layer is not aware that for a double parity setup it effectively has to write the same information three times, and the integrity layer has to account for all three writes before the data is considered synced as required by <code>conv=fdatasync</code>.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>We have found that the throguhput of such a storage design is yielding useful throughput-rates.
The next question is about the latency of the system, which we will, for simplicity, only estimate for random 4K-reads.
Again, just as above, we will investigate the impact of the different layers of the system.
To do so, we read 100.000 sectors randomly from an 18GB sized testfile filling the storage mountpoint for each configuration after dropping all caches.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Latency comparison of system layers</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layerlatencies.svg" alt="Distribution of latencies in milliseconds for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system. green denotes the median, black denotes the average of the latencies of the respective setup, access times below 1ms were considered cache hits and therefore excluded for the computation of mean and average.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure above yields several interesting insights:
First of all, we do see cache hits close to zero milliseconds, furthermore, we see that the latency distribution is fairly evenly distributed over the available range and finally and most interestingly, we see that the impact of the several layers onto the latency is measurable, but rather irrellevant for typical practical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-comparison-with-zfs">Performance comparison with ZFS</h2>
<p>So far we have tested the setup on its intended target platform, the Helios4.
To compare the resulting system against the elephant in the room, ZFS, we will use a different test platform, based on an Intel i7-2600K as CPU and 4x1TB disks, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> was not reliably buildable on Debian Buster on ARM, and when it actually built, it explicitly stated that 32bit-processors (as the Helios’ CPU) are not supported by upstream, although technically the system would run.</p>
<p>To allow for a cleaner comparison, the testbed was accordinly changed to accomodate for ZFS’s preferences.
As ZFS did not adhere to <code>conv=fdatasync</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the main memory was restricted to 1GB, swap was turned off and the size of the testfile was chosen to be 18GB.
This way, any caching happening would be at least significantly reduced as there was little space next to the OS inside of the main memory for caching.</p>
<p>All tests were run on a Debian 10 “Buster” with Linux 4.19, ZFS was used in form of the package <code>zfs-dkms</code> in version 0.8.2 from backports.
The storage layer for both setups was layouted with double parity (RAID6/raidz2) and, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> package in Debian was not able to do encryption, the mdraid-based setup was also setup without the encryption layer.</p>
<h3 id="throughput-1">Throughput</h3>
<p>The commands used for benchmarking throughput were conceptually the same as above:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=18000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>Although ZFS seemingly does not adhere to any cache dropping or syncing instructions, they were still performed and adhered to by the mdraid-based setup.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput comparison, zfs &amp; md</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-md-throughput.svg" alt="Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-testbed.txt">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The results are very interesting: While the md-based setup performs less consistent in and of itself, it still consistently outperforms ZFS in read performance.
When it comes to write, though, ZFS performs noticably better.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To investigate the cause of this unexpected balance, we note that while ZFS combines raid, integrity and filesystem in one component, for the md-based setup these are separate components.
Of these components, not only the filesystem, but also the <code>dm-integrity</code> implements journalling to avoid inconsistencies in case of a power outage.
This leads to increased work until the transaction has been fully flushed to disk, which can be seen in the next figure, where the md-based system (without the encryption layer) is tested with both journalling enabled and disabled in the integrity layer:</p>
<figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599156332456/7WwIJcqD0.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We all use some VS Code extensions for our day to day development and are always on a hunt for more useful extensions. Here is a list of mine and how I use them:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.peacockcode.dev/">Peacock</a> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593585542633/58FKxSF2u.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt=""></p>
<p>We have all been there when we have two editors open and coded in the wrong one 🤦  Peacock helps me differentiate between different workspaces by setting a different color theme to VS Code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/activeScopeBorder.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easily distinguishable bracket scopes are always good for programming and this extension does it well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/printscreen-select-lines.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you are in the flow but navigating the code from one function to another becomes tedious, this lets you bookmark code at different lines and you can easily access it using shortcuts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There have been times when I have embarrassingly spent more time than needed debugging an error only to find out it was a spelling mistake. This extension keeps that in check.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auiworks.amvim">AmVim</a></p>
<p> I am a huge fan of Vim, it legit increases your productivity without having to touch the trackpad. AmVim is one of the Vim mode extension for VSCode, I found this to be quite good and not bloaty compared to other Vim extensions.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">Settings Sync</a></p>
<p>Settings Sync helps you keep the same environment of VSCode (extensions and preferences) across machines.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log">Turbo Console log</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dysw7p/insert_log_message.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is really useful while debugging, it helps create meaningful logs using shortcuts. All you have to do is highlight the variable and press the keybindings.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode">Tab Nine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/raw/master/assets/tabnine.gif" alt="sdfsdf"></p>
<p>I just recently came across this one in one of <a href="https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips">Chris Bongers</a>'s article. Really like it! It is sometimes just scary how accurately it predicts auto-completion (It uses deep-learning model locally on your machine to come up with the predictions).</p>
<hr><p>
Other than these I use the common ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon theme</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight">Color Highlight</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wart.ariake-dark">Ariake Dark</a> is my VS Code theme.</p>

<p>Hope you found this useful and feel free to share the extensions you use in the comments below. You can also @ me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vamsirao7">twitter</a></p>

<p>How much does running a webapp in production actually cost? Maybe more than you think. Keepthescore.co is a Python flask application running on DigitalOcean and Firebase. It currently has around 55k unique visitors per month, per day it’s around 3.4k.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/money-tree.jpg" alt="A money tree">
<em>Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@micheile">Micheile Henderson</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s a monthly breakdown with some background information on each cost:</p>

<h3 id="servers-and-database-on-digitalocean">Servers and database on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $95</strong></p>

<p>The webapp runs on two identical DigitalOcean servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 80GB disk). We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>, which is a great way of running and hosting a webapp (more on that in a future post) but it does mean that you need 2 identical production servers.</p>

<p>The database is a hosted Postgres instance also on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Note: the servers are oversized for the load we’re currently seeing. The reason for that is that we tried to solve a production issue by increasing the server specs. It didn’t solve the problem, and now we can’t down-size the servers without re-provisioning them 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="code-repo-on-github">Code repo on GitHub</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $0</strong></p>

<p>This is free. Thanks GitHub!
</p><hr>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $60</strong></p>

<p>We use a reporting tool called <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to generate insights and reports from the database. The tool itself is opensource and free, but hosting it is fairly expensive. Currently it runs on an EC2 instance. There are definitely some savings that could be realised here.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $1.32</strong></p>

<p>We use Firebase for the <a href="https://keepthescore.co/basketball-scoreboard/">realtime basketball scoreboard</a>. We also use the Google Sheets API for some custom scoreboards. Overall it must be said that the Google Cloud APIs are great value for money (so far).</p>

<p>We have plans to move away from DigitalOcean and onto Google Cloud infrastructure in the next year.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="dns-hosting">DNS hosting</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $5</strong></p>

<p>Our domain is registered with <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple.com</a>.
</p><hr>



<p><strong>Costs per month: $10</strong></p>

<p>Scoreboards and this blog have the option of allowing a discussion on the same page – this uses the <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> service. Disqus has a free tier but they began showing ads so we were forced to move to the paid tier.</p>

<p>We are planning to move to <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a> in the future, which is cheaper, has no ads, and respects your privacy.
</p><hr>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-it-is-there-revenue">Is it worth it? Is there revenue?</h2>

<p>In total that’s around <strong>$171 USD per month</strong>. If you’re running a company with employees that would be peanuts, but in this case the cost is being borne by a single indie-developer out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is that on the revenue side there’s a big fat zero. This is the reason why we are currently working on monetization. This will include banner ads and payments via Stripe. Expect to see these features land by next week! Anyway, more about that in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-spending-way-too-much-money">You are spending way too much money!</h2>

<p>This post generated an interesting discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24372084">Hacker News</a>. One recurring theme
was that our stack is large and expensive and that we could massively reduce costs.</p>

<p>This is true. But here are some things that are also true:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Reducing costs” is not our primary objective at the moment: time is more valuable than money right now.</li>
<li>Our primary objective right now is velocity of product development.</li>
<li>We are not devops experts and optimizing operations takes time.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a follow up post once we do optimize our stack.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and so long, 👋</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>new</span>
  <span>FixedArray</span><span>{</span><span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedArrayMap</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span> <span>objects</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span><span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>
    <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedDoubleArrayMap</span><span>,</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span>
    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

  <div>
    
    <p>Earlier this year, we contributed a driver for the Input/Output Memory
Management Unit (IOMMU) introduced with the Allwinner H6 SoCs in Linux,
that got merged in Linux 5.8. It felt like a good occasion to write
about what an IOMMU is, what it’s useful for and how it integrates into
Linux.</p>

<p>At the low-level, a CPU executes an infinite sequence of instructions,
some of them either reading or writing to an address in memory.
Depending on the system design, the hardware maps that address to the
main RAM of the system, or to a specific device. The set of all the
memory addresses than the CPU can access is the memory space.</p>
<p>In older or simpler designs, the CPU accesses directly the physical
location on the memory bus of a memory word or register, the physical
address. This simple design is still in use on some micro-controllers
today, but it introduces some issues related to security, and
reliability.</p>
<p>Indeed, that design doesn’t enforce any isolation between processes or
permission checks. This means that any process in the system has
read/write access to the entire memory in the system, including the
kernel and other applications. This could lead to a system-wide memory
corruption if a buggy application starts to write at some random place
in memory. And this is the ideal scenario: indeed, it also allowed any
process to snoop on any memory stored by another process or the kernel,
leading to potential sensitive information leaks if that process was
malicious.</p>
<p>To fix that issue, CPU designs introduced a hardware unit called the
Memory Management Unit (MMU) that intercepts all the memory accesses
done by the CPU once enabled and translates them. This mechanism allows
to have two distinct address spaces: the physical address space that we
talked about earlier, and a virtual address space that the CPU operates
on, the MMU being in charge of translating the virtual addresses into
physical addresses when the CPU access them.</p>
<p>The best part is that the kernel can change the virtual address space
anytime, so it actually uses one virtual address space per process (and
potentially one for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">kernel</a>). In
addition, the MMU also allows to set extra attributes to carry out
access control over memory ranges, allowing to change whether we want to
allow the associated process to read, write, or execute the data stored
in a particular range.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows the kernel to prevent any process to messing with
the memory of another process at the hardware level, almost entirely
closing the class of attacks we mentioned earlier, and enables
the operating system to provide more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_virtual_memory_management">optimizations</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">features</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it looks complete, there’s a limitation though: the MMU
translates the addresses used by the <strong>CPU</strong>. Yet, some devices can also
access memory directly without the CPU intervention using a feature
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</a>,
and since the CPU isn’t involved, the MMU isn’t either. This means that we’re
still vulnerable to the same class of issues than the one we described earlier
if we perform a misconfigured DMA operation or if an attacker
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack">manages</a> to trick a device
into reading some other parts of the memory than the one it’s supposed
to access. As an example of such an attack, you can find an in-depth
article explaining how the Google Project Zero team was able to pull
this off on a Nexus 6 modem
<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To close that channel of attacks, system designers later integrated
IOMMUs, that fill pretty much the same needs and with the same features
than regular MMUs, but providing that translation and protection to
devices that perform DMA instead of the CPU. It’s not unusual to even
have several IOMMUs: the GPU almost always has its own, and then there
would be another one for the rest or a subset of the devices in the
system.</p>
<p>IOMMUs also allow to address a common issue where the device isn’t able
to access the entirety of the buffer for some reason. It mainly happens
either when the buffer it’s supposed to perform DMA on isn’t contiguous
in physical memory and is thus split between some chunks while the
device can solely perform DMA on a single chunk; or when the device
can’t access the buffer location in RAM due to some limitations. One
common limitation would be that devices can just access the lowest 4 GB
of the RAM (since it’s addressable on 32 bits), while the system might
have more than that. Either way, the way to deal with that situation is
to create a <em>bounce buffer</em>: a temporary buffer that the device can
access and where we’re going to copy the content of the original buffer
to so that the device can access it. There’s an obvious performance cost
to it though, since we could introduce a copy of the whole buffer before
the device can operate on it. Still, IOMMUs save the day once again
since you can basically create any mapping, both accommodating the
non-contiguous case by creating a mapping where the virtual buffer would
be contiguous, and using a virtual address that the device can access.</p>

<h2 id="the-iommu-framework">The IOMMU Framework</h2>
<p>Since an IOMMU is so useful, Linux gained support for IOMMUs using a
dedicated driver framework under <strong>drivers/iommu</strong>. That framework uses
three different concepts to enforce permissions as fine-grained as
possible for a given device: domains, groups, and devices.</p>
<p>A device is quite straightforward, it’s a device that can perform DMA
operations through our IOMMU, a domain is a representation of a virtual
address space and a group is a set of devices that the IOMMU can’t
isolate from each other. The framework then relies on functions to
manage those three concepts. As you can see in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/iommu.h#n191">the operations that a driver can perform</a>,
all those functions are to manage the relationships between the devices,
groups and domains that the system is going to have, and manage each
individually (to create a mapping in a particular domain for example).</p>
<h2 id="the-dma-api">The DMA API</h2>
<p>The second part of the integration in Linux, once it knows how to
manage the various address spaces through the IOMMU framework and
drivers, is to allow the drivers for the devices that need to perform
DMA to use that IOMMU.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of Linux is to be as portable as possible, and it
does so by abstracting much of the usual driver operations through
frameworks and APIs, and allows to decouple the driver itself (how does
one need to program a device to perform a given operation) from how the
platform works (in our case, how would the platform do DMA, or how
should Linux configure the IOMMU).</p>
<p>DMA is no different here, and Linux has two distinct APIs depending on
the context: the streaming API and the coherent API. As we mentioned
earlier, you would use one over the other depending on the situation
you’re in, and who is in charge of allocating the buffer that gets
accessed through DMA. If the user-space hands the buffer to the driver
(for example when you would send a network packet, or write to a file),
you’d need to setup a temporary mapping through the streaming API. In
other situations though, the kernel would be in charge of allocating the
buffer and then pass that buffer to the user-space—the Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) and Video4Linux2 (v4l2) can operate like that—, and that
would be where you’d need the coherent API.</p>
<p>The two APIs are here to make sure that the device can perform DMA on
the buffer we want to access. They thus make sure that the device can
access the buffer. What it actually means then depends on the platform,
what memory range the device can access, which memory allocator to use,
etc. Part of that decision involves whether the device accesses go
through an IOMMU, which then gets configured properly to create the
mappings for our buffer in the device’s virtual address space.</p>

<p>We contributed to Linux 5.8 a driver for the IOMMU introduced by
Allwinner in their H6 SoC. Compared to the IOMMUs found on modern PCs,
its design is a bit simple: it doesn’t support virtualization, there’s a
single address space, and it doesn’t cover all the devices doing DMA in
the system but solely the DMA intensive ones: the video and display
devices.</p>
<p>The driver thus registers and allows a single domain and group since the
IOMMU can’t isolate devices from one another, and it supports a single
address space. Despite these limitations though, it’s still a welcome
addition for all the reasons above.</p>
<p>Video and display controllers also require a lot of big, contiguous
buffers allocated through the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) on
earlier SoCs. CMA works by putting aside a part of the system RAM at
boot, and allocating big buffers from that area. There’s a big drawback
now though: the system has to maintain a rather big (in the 100 MB
order), static, pool of RAM put aside, no matter if the system is going
to use its video or display capabilities, and without any way to give
the RAM back if it doesn’t. As we discussed, an IOMMU has the capability
to map several, separate, chunks in physical memory to provide a
contiguous buffer in the device virtual space, effectively reducing (or
even removing) the need for CMA.</p>

<p>With Linux 5.8 onward, the Allwinner H6 uses its IOMMU with the DRM
display driver and the Cedrus video decoder driver. As time goes by and
we enable its usage across more drivers, it benefits more devices.
And with any luck, more Allwinner SoCs will feature an IOMMU.</p>

<p><img alt="Libvirt The Unsung Hero of Cloud Computing Platforms" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_the_unsung_hero.png"></p><p>Initially my intention was to write an article on <strong>Round up of open source Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)</strong>, but while doing research found one piece of software library so fundamental, that it holds the key to very existence of Cloud Computing services and platforms as we know it today (that includes Amazon AWS, OpenStack and CloudStack). So I decided to postpone my idea and started to write an article on this <strong>Unsung hero of Cloud Computing</strong> called libvirt <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, which I believe many people won’t have heard of. Obviously talking about software library tend to be technical, so this article will have a technical tone, but I will attempt to make it readable for everyone interested in Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualzation and these APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of Cloud Management Platform. Libvirt makes it possible to control and manage millions of compute nodes, storage and network devices via common programmable interface. Its like being able to control and orchestrate fleet of millions of car irrespective of different manufacturer, model, or engine through a common interface from a single car (it can be more then one car for redundancy and high availability). What started as a management API for Xen, today has been extended to support major components of Cloud Computing platforms.</p>
<div id="libvirt-goals-architecture">
<h2>Libvirt Goals &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>Libvirt defines following terms for its goals <a href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Mapping of libvirt terms to virtualized or containerized physical machine" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_terms_mapping.png"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong> is a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a layer of softeare allowing to virtualize a node in a set of physical machines with possible different configurations that the node itself.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> is an instance of an operating system (or subsystem in case of container virtualization like OpenVZ and lxc) running on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above terms <strong>“The goal of libvirt is to provide a common and stable layer sufficient to securely manage domains on a node, possibly remote”</strong>. So libvirt should provide all APIs needed to do the management, such as: provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate and stop the domains - within the limits of the support of the hypervisor for those operations. This implies following sub-goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API can be carried remotely though secure APIs</li>
<li>While most API will be generic in term of hypervisor or Host OS, some API may be targeted to a single virtualization environment as long as the semantic for the operations from a domain management perspective is clear</li>
<li>the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations needed to manage domains on a node, including resource provisioning and setup</li>
<li>the API will not try to provide high level virtualization policies or multi-nodes management features like load balancing, but the API should be sufficient so they can be implemented on top of libvirt</li>
<li>stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization framework</li>
<li>the node being managed may be on a different physical machine than the management program using libvirt, to this effect libvirt supports remote access, but should only do so by using secure protocols.</li>
<li>libvirt will provide APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and NUMA partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So libvirt is intended to be a building block for higher level management tools and for applications focusing on virtualization of a single node (the only exception being domain migration between node capabilities which involves more than one node).</p>
<div id="libvirt-driver-based-architecture">
<h3>Libvirt Driver Based Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt driver based architecture" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_architecture.png"></p><p>Libvirt to support wide variety of hypervisor implements a driver-based architecture. Based on car analogy, it means delegating the actual implementation of control of different cars to the drivers specifically designed for make, model and engine of the specific car. Libvirt currently supports:</p>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LXC - Linux Containers</li>
<li>OpenVZ</li>
<li>QEMU</li>
<li>Test - Used for testing</li>
<li>UML - User Mode Linux</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMware ESX</li>
<li>VMware Workstation/Player</li>
<li>Xen</li>
<li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li>
<li>IBM PowerVM (phyp)</li>
<li>Parallels</li>
<li>Remote - Accessing libvirt on remote node through libvirtd (libvirt daemon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directory backend</li>
<li>Local filesystem backend</li>
<li>Network filesystem backend</li>
<li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM) backend</li>
<li>Disk backend</li>
<li>iSCSI backend</li>
<li>SCSI backend</li>
<li>Multipath backend</li>
<li>RBD (RADOS Block Device) backend</li>

</div>
<div id="libvirt-api-structure">
<h3>Libvirt API structure <a href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a></h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_api_structure.png"></p><p>The figure above shows the five main objects exported by the API:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>virConnectPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the connection to a hypervisor. Use one of the virConnectOpen functions to obtain connection to the hypervisor which is then used as a parameter to other connection API’s.</dd>
<dt><strong>virDomainPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one domain either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently running on that node). The function virConnectListAllDomains lists all the domains for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virNetworkPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one network either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently activated). The function virConnectListAllNetworks lists all the virtualization networks for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStorageVolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one storage volume generally used as a block device available to one of the domains. The function virStorageVolLookupByPath finds the storage volume object based on its path on the node.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStoragePoolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents a storage pool, which is a logical area used to allocate and store storage volumes. The function virConnectListAllStoragePools lists all of the virtualization storage pools on the hypervisor. The function virStoragePoolLookupByVolume finds the storage pool containing a given storage volume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These names follow C conventions, but developers of cloud computing platforms and applications do not need to use C directly, there are language bindings available for major languages. Currently libvirt API language bindings <a href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a> are available for C#, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-management-architecture">
<h3>Domain Management Architecture</h3>
<p>There are two distinct means for domain management using libvirt API.</p>
<p><strong>1. Single node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_single_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As illustrated in the figure above in this mode applications (cloud management platform i.e. CMP applications) and domains exist on the same node. In this scenario applications directly works through the libvirt api on the host operating system (os) to control and manage the local domains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_multi_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, applications (CMP applications) using libvirt API and the domains to manage or control are on separate nodes. In this mode a special domain called <strong>libvirtd</strong> (libvirt daemon) needs to run on remote nodes. The management application nodes use the nodes underlying network communicattion to communicate with remote <em>libvirtd</em> through the local libvirt using custom protocol. Actually libvirt uses Remote <a href="#f6" id="id5">[6]</a> driver for communicating with remote node and remote API calls are handled synchronously. Remote driver for libvirt supports a range of transports like:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>tls</em></dt>
<dd>TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) authenticated and encrypted TCP/IP socket, usually listening on a public port number. To use this you will need to generate client and server certificates. The standard port is 16514. This is the <strong>default</strong> transport, if no other is specified.</dd>
<dt><em>unix</em></dt>
<dd>nix domain socket. Since this is only accessible on the local machine, it is not encrypted, and uses Unix permissions or SELinux for authentication. The standard socket names are /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro (the latter for read-only connections).</dd>
<dt><em>ssh</em></dt>
<dd>Transported over an ordinary ssh (secure shell) connection. Requires Netcat (nc) installed and libvirtd should be running on the remote machine. You should use some sort of ssh key management (eg. ssh-agent) otherwise programs which use this transport will stop to ask for a password.</dd>
<dt><em>ext</em></dt>
<dd>Any external program which can make a connection to the remote machine by means outside the scope of libvirt.</dd>
<dt><em>tcp</em></dt>
<dd>nencrypted TCP/IP socket. Not recommended for production use, this is normally disabled, but an administrator can enable it for testing or use over a trusted network. The standard port is 16509.</dd>
<dt><em>libssh2</em></dt>
<dd>Transport over the SSH protocol using libssh2 instead of the OpenSSH binary. This transport uses the libvirt authentication callback for all ssh authentication calls and therefore supports keyboard-interactive authentication even with graphical management applications. As with the classic ssh transport netcat is required on the remote side.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Libvirt is one very important library on whose giant shoulders cloud computing services and platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus and numberous others are standing. Also this API enables developers and companies to build new and innovative cloud computing services or platforms and build awesome applications or services on top of it. Libvirt started in 2005 and with growing popularity of cloud computing, this project will continue to grow. But in most of the conferences, talks and papers related to Cloud Computing I did not find much coverage of libvirt, so while researching Cloud Management platform thought of writing and article on it. Kudos to all the libvirt code contributors for building a beautiful abstraction layer and making life easier for cloud computing services and platform developers. In spite of not getting as much press and coverage as …</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>

(This is a guest essay submitted to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?oldui=1#!topic/metaphysical-speculations/L1Cf4Opd8hI" target="_blank">Metaphysical Speculations Discussion Forum</a>, where it was extensively reviewed and critically commented on by forum members. The opinions expressed in it are those of its author.)</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="695" data-original-width="695" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>

  <p>One of the eternal laws of the internet dictates that as soon as one person says
they have a new thing that lets them type faster — a keyboard, a keyboard
layout, an editor configuration, etc. —&nbsp;somebody else must say: “but typing is
not the bottleneck!”</p>

<p>What the second person means is that the first person is wasting their time.
They’re optimizing something that’s not slowing them down. Typing is not the
bottleneck, because <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9715810">“typing is perhaps 0.5-1% of my programming
time”</a>. Programming is <em>thinking</em>, talking to people, planning,
researching, is what incarnations of person #2 are saying. And if you think your
keyboard is holding you back from thinking, well, you’re wrong.</p>

<p>I get that. I don’t write code the whole day either.</p>

<p>But here’s what I need to write and type besides code: commit messages, pull
request descriptions, emails, tickets, comments on tickets, code reviews,
documentation, Slack messages, notes, journal entries, RFCs, design documents,
requirements.</p>

<p>And being able to type fast and without much effort sure as hell helps. It lets
me get back to the thinking.</p>

<p>Effort, that’s the important one, not raw speed. It doesn’t matter if you can
type 90 words per minutes or 130, but if it takes you <em>effort</em> to type something
and, if given the choice, you’d rather not do it, then we have a problem.</p>

<p>Take me on my phone, for example. It takes me a lot of effort to type on it.
It’s not only that I’m slow because I can’t use more than two fingers, but every
third word is a typo. Or, even more infuriating, it’s the wrong word and I need
to correct autocorrect. Or I switched from English to German while typing and my
phone doesn’t know what an umlaut is anymore.</p>

<p>If you see me typing on my phone chances are you can also hear me producing an
angry growl-like sound.</p>

<p>Which is exactly why I don’t do it a lot. I barely use the note taking apps I
have, because I’d rather type on my computer, with a proper keyboard. I often
refrain from replying to messages if I don’t have to, because, yep, I’d have to
type those replies.</p>

<p>In other words: typing <em>is</em> a bottleneck for me.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me on my phone. Ever had a chat conversation with somebody who
wasn’t comfortable typing? Here’s what you get: short messages, acronyms, typos,
missing sentences. You can <em>read</em> how they struggled to type. I once had a
colleague who had the habit of walking to my desk saying “Ah, before I type all
that up, I thought I’d quickly tell you in person” where “all that” was three to
four paragraphs, at the most.</p>

<p>And that’s what this is about. If you’re not comfortable typing a lot and you’d
rather not write something down then typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck and you need to
fix it. Typing is not something you should need to think about.</p>

<p>Because wouldn’t it be a waste of time if you spend 99% of your time lying in a
hammock, thinking, but then choose not to write all of your ideas down, because
typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck?</p>

<article>
  <p>This blog post discusses the support for Rightward assignments in ruby.</p>

<h3 id="before">Before</h3>

<p>Historically, all of the early programming languages were designed by Mathematicians. It’s a common practice in mathematics to say <code>let x = 4y + z</code>, which is read as let <code>x</code> be equal to <code>4y + z</code>.</p>

<p>So the same pattern is followed in programming languages as well.</p>

<p>For assigning a value to a variable, we typically do <code>age = 42</code> in ruby. Here we are assigning the <code>Rvalue</code> <code>42</code> to an <code>Lvalue</code> <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>While the above pattern has become standardized, it feels somewhat unnatural as we read most of the spoken languages from left to right.</p>

<p>We were not able to do something like <code>42 =&gt; age</code>.</p>

<h3 id="after">After</h3>

<p>With the recent <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/1b2d351b216661e03d497dfdce216e0d51474664#diff-8312ad0561ef661716b48d09478362f3">changes</a>, Ruby supports the <strong>Right ward assignments</strong> as demonstrated below.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>box_height</span> <span># This is equivalent to box_height = 3</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a look at few more examples:</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>traits</span>
  <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>traits</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>



<h3 id="additional-notes">Additional notes:</h3>

<p>There are already some languages which support rightward assignment.</p>

<p><code>TI-BASIC’s</code> uses STO (“store”) operation to achieve this, as demonstrated below:</p>

<p><code>42→age</code></p>

<p><code>R language</code> also has a similar way of doing this  <code>42 -&gt; age</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is added as an experimental feature in Ruby, which means it could be removed depending on the feedback received.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>This is an article by <strong>Thaddeus Michaels</strong>, who is a data scientist.</em><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p>A few things to make clear up front: I am not ideologically opposed to state intervention in areas of public health; I believe vaccines work; I believe Covid-19 is a real, somewhat dangerous disease which emerged in China in late 2019 and can be fatal; I’m not a Brexiteer or libertarian.</p>
<p>But I believe a form of mass hysteria has spread through society in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rational thought about costs and benefits has evaporated, and we have done more harm than good in our response.</p>
<p>Instead of a conspiracy theory, here is a plausible ‘good faith’ explanation for why this may have happened.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Confirmation bias and pet theories</strong></p>
<p>The origins of the hysteria, in my view, lay with many researchers and public intellectuals who had been theorising about ‘The Great Pandemic’ for a long time.</p>
<p>It may not have been a mainstream topic of conversation, but anyone interested in fields like medicine, complexity science, and risk analysis would have heard chatter about the imminent pandemic threat.</p>
<p>We’d had a few false alarms in bird flu (2003) and swine flu (2009), and some nasty regional outbreaks of diseases like SARS (2002-04) and Ebola (2013-16).</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that some people were highly attuned to the possibility of a deadly pandemic. They had developed toolkits for forecasting and responding to it, often based on mathematical models they had fallen in love with.</p>
<p>The risk, as always in politics, is that you fight your last war. Many of the most draconian responses to Covid-19 have been promoted by people who cut their teeth on Ebola and SARS outbreaks.</p>
<p>Both those diseases are far more deadly than Covid-19 – making it easier to persuade the public to comply with tough control measures, and heavily penalising any society that fails to control an outbreak.</p>
<p>As anecdotal information arrived from China, Iran and Italy that something very bad was happening (and let’s be honest, it was!) this information wasn’t weighed up properly. People didn’t pause to think about whether the disease would behave like this in all settings, but began to accept that it was <em>The Great Pandemic</em> that everyone had feared.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Availability bias and tunnel vision</strong></p>
<p>The next step, after enough influential people had succumbed to confirmation bias, was to start distorting the information pipeline.</p>
<p>This wasn’t fake news, it was just a massive imbalance of information.</p>
<p>As the threat from Covid-19 became apparent, there was a well-intentioned global effort to churn out Covid-19 data as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I doubt I was the only person to spend much of the early part of 2020 looking at Worldmeter time series of Covid-19 case and death counts in different countries.</p>
<p>John Burn-Murdoch at the FT produced a dazzling array of charts showing fatalities, introducing a lay audience to log-scale charts, and then publishing what he called ‘gold standard’ data on excess deaths.</p>
<p>It was very easy for anyone vaguely interested in data to become an expert of sorts, just by following a few Twitter accounts and reading the right newspapers.</p>
<p>But the catch was that the policy response to Covid-19 could not be judged solely on Covid-19 outcomes. We also needed to look at second order effects of each policy response: mental health problems, cancer deaths, job losses, mortgage defaults, domestic violence, child abuse, and so on.</p>
<p>Much of the data needed to judge these second order effects <em>still</em> does not exist. The urgent ramp up of Covid-19 data was not matched by any urgency to collect and publish this data at a similar rate. So the cost-benefit analysis is inherently biased in favour of Covid-19 preventation.</p>
<p>With public health officials judged exclusively on their performance on Covid-19 KPIs, tunnel vision was naturally going to set in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Clickbait journalism and influencer attention seeking</strong></p>
<p>As the availability of Covid-19 data ramped up, this also created an active online market for fear porn.</p>
<p>We had uninformed attention seekers like Piers Morgan flying the flag for extreme reactions to Covid-19 on the basis of their own very rudimentary understanding of the statistics.</p>
<p>A particularly bizarre moment was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C98FmoZVbjs&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">a debate on Channel 4 News on 12<sup>th</sup> March 2020</a> where Tomas Pueyo (a ‘growth hacker’ at an e-learning company) debated John Edmunds (a professor of epidemiology and SAGE member).</p>
<p>Pueyo had written a blog post <em><a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now</a></em>, which had attracted global attention. It was superficially plausible, but riddled with overreaching arguments, overconfident predictions, and false equivalences.</p>
<p>On the programme, Edmunds says that we are past the stage where eradication is feasible, and that “the only way to stop this epidemic is indeed herd immunity” (one assumes he means via either infection-recovery or vaccination).</p>
<p>Pueyo, who has only recently appointed himself as an expert on pandemics, theatrically holds his head in his hands. “This is like deciding, you know what, this forest might burn, so let’s cut a third of it! This is crazy!”</p>
<p>He then says: “So you’re saying we want to kill 200,000 people in the UK!”</p>
<p>This kind of analysis quickly became mainstream. Initial case fatality rates (heavily skewed by early treatment failures and the virus’s higher spread in hospitals and care homes) were naively extrapolated to wider society.</p>
<p>Crude, back-of-a-fag-packet calculations and hand waving arguments were granted authority, because informed critics could not match the hysterics for eye-bulging certainty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, social media platforms are a major reason why so many countries collectively lost their nerve. Pueyo’s accessible blog post spread like wildfire. Worldometer charts allowed people to naively compare their progress against other countries, and force change. Only Sweden held out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Politicisation and assumptions of bad faith</strong></p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin was the sifting of Covid-19 viewpoints into old political tribes.</p>
<p>Lockdown scepticism started to become a Brexiteer/libertarian position. Strong support for masking and social distancing was associated with so-called ‘Karens’.</p>
<p>Teachers’ unions saw an opportunity to undermine the Johnson government by nonsensically advocating for prolonged school closures, despite plenty of evidence from other European countries that this was unnecessary.</p>
<p>In the States, anything Trump said about coronavirus was instinctively added to the list of wrongthink by his political opponents, even when he accidentally said sensible things.</p>
<p>Lest we forget, Trump was one of the first advocates for restricting travel from China when the outbreak first happened – in hindsight, a sensible move.</p>
<p>We now have Twitter dominated by Covid tribes like #WearAMask, #ClapForTheNHS and #KBF (Keep Britain Free). They each draw from predictable ends of the political spectrum. It is all very reminiscent of Brexit.</p>
<p>It is challenging to have a nuanced discussion about Covid-19 on social media now, although there are a handful of scientists who have held firm – <a href="https://twitter.com/BallouxFrancois">Prof Francois Balloux</a> is one of the most impressive at neither downplaying the genuine threat from Covid-19, nor succumbing to tunnel vision.</p>
<p><strong>How do we escape this?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, we run into the old reality that ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. Covid-19 hysteria is an emotional, identity-driven position masquerading as a set of facts.</p>
<p>It has spread so widely, though, that there are few control cases available for comparison, besides Sweden.</p>
<p>Sweden is a useful example for lockdown sceptics, but it is too easy for pro-lockdown voices to dismiss Sweden as an outlier country that anyway experienced a higher death toll than neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>On individual questions like school closures, we are starting to see some emerging evidence that the hysterics were wrong. Perhaps similar evidence will emerge soon on measures like track and trace, mask wearing, and so on.</p>
<p>Many of the ‘Covid Hero’ countries like New Zealand will see that status diminish as they find themselves vulnerable to imported outbreaks. That may help to recalibrate the debate.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I fear it will only be the rampant social, economic and psychological destruction we inflict on the world’s youth that will eventually up-end the mainstream consensus.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is the article I wish I had read when I started coding. Programming is about solving problems and here I will dive deep into 20 problem-solving techniques, with code samples, big O analysis, and challenges so that you can master them.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourdevopsguy.com/how-to-ace-coding-interviews-the-ultimate-guide-ckcxekdxp00bqois16r59a9c1">this article</a>, I outlined a high-level strategy to prepare for your next coding interview as well as the top mistakes to avoid. Here, I will dive deep into 20 problem-solving techniques that you must know to excel at your next interview. They have helped me at work too and even given me ideas for a side project I am working on. Also, the last section includes a <strong>step-by-step guide to learn (not memorize) any algorithm or data structure</strong>, with 2 examples.</p>
<p>I have grouped these techniques in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pointer based</li>
<li>Recursion based</li>
<li>Sorting and searching</li>
<li>Extending basic data structures</li>
<li>Miscellanea</li>
</ul>
<p>I will explain each of them, show how to apply them to coding problems, and leave you some exercises so that you can practice on your own.</p>
<p>This list is part of the study notes that I took before I applied to Amazon. I hope they will be as useful to you as they have been to me.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I have copied here the problem statements, but I have left links to all of the exercises. You can copy-paste my solution and play around with it. I strongly recommend you code your solution and see if it passes the tests.</p>
<p>Some of the questions are better explained through an image or diagram. For these, I have left a comment asking you to open the link to get a graphical description of the problem.</p>

<h2 id="1-two-pointers">1. Two Pointers</h2>
<p>This technique is very useful on <em>sorted arrays</em> and arrays whose elements we want to <em>group</em>. </p>
<p>The idea is to use two (or more pointers) to split the array into different areas or groups based on some condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements smaller than, equal to and greater than a certain value</li>
<li>Elements whose sum is too small or too large</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples will help you understand this principle.</p>
<h3 id="two-sumhttpsleetcodecomproblemstwo-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/">Two sum</a></h3>
<p>Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.</li>
<li>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9</li>
<li>Output: [1,2]</li>
<li>Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Since the array <em>a</em> is sorted, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest sum is equal to the sum of the last 2 elements</li>
<li>The smallest sum is equal to the sum of the first 2 elements </li>
<li>For any index <em>i</em> in [0, a.size() - 1) =&gt; a[i + 1] &gt;= a[i]</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we can design the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep 2 pointers: <em>l</em>, starting at the first element of the array, and <em>r</em> starting at to the last.</li>
<li>If the sum of a[l] + a[r] is smaller than our target, we increment l by one (to change the smallest operand in the addition for another one equal or larger than it at <em>l+1</em>); if it is larger than the target, we decrease r by one (to change our largest operand for another one equal or smaller at <em>r-1</em>).</li>
<li>We do this until a[l] + a[r] equals our target or l and r point to the same element (since we cannot use the same element twice) or have crossed, indicating there is no solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple C++ implementation:</p>
<pre><code><span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; twoSum(<span>const</span> <span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; a, <span>int</span> target) {
        <span>int</span> l = <span>0</span>, r = a.size() - <span>1</span>;
        <span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; sol;
        <span>while</span>(l &lt; r) {
            <span>const</span> <span>int</span> sum = a[l] + a[r];
            <span>if</span>(target == sum){
                sol.push_back(l + <span>1</span>); 
                sol.push_back(r + <span>1</span>); 
                <span>break</span>;
            } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (target &gt; sum) {
                ++l;
            } <span>else</span> {
                --r;
            }
        }
        <span>return</span> sol;
    }
</code></pre><p>The time complexity is O(N), since we may need to traverse the N elements of the array to find the solution. </p>
<p>The space complexity is O(1), since we only need two pointers, regardless of how many elements the array contains.</p>
<p>There are other ways of solving this problem (using a hash table, for example), but I have used it just as an illustration of the two pointer technique.</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>Here are two variations of this exercise: <a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/">three sum</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/">four sum</a>. They can be solved similarly by <strong>reducing</strong> them to this very same problem. </p>
<p>This is a very common technique: <strong>transform a problem whose solution you don't know to a problem that you can solve</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="remove-duplicates-from-arrayhttpsleetcodecomproblemsremove-duplicates-from-sorted-array"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/">Remove duplicates from array</a></h3>
<p>Given a sorted array, nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given nums = [1,1,2],</li>
<li>Output = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],</li>
<li>Output = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The array is <strong>sorted</strong> and we want to move duplicates to the end of the array, which sounds a lot like <strong>grouping based on some condition</strong>. How would you solve this problem using two pointers?</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need one pointer to iterate through the array, <em>i</em>.</li>
<li>And a second pointer, <em>n</em>, one to define the area that contains no duplicates: [0,n].</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic is as follows. If the values of the elements at index <em>i</em> (except <em>i</em> = 0) and <em>i-1</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same, we don’t do anything - this duplicate will be overwritten by the next unique element in <em>a</em>.</li>
<li>Different: we add <em>a[i]</em> to the section of the array that contains no duplicates - delimited by <em>n</em>, and increment n by one.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>removeDuplicates</span><span>(<span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; nums)</span> </span>{
    <span>if</span>(nums.empty())
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    <span>int</span> n = <span>0</span>;
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; nums.size(); ++i){
        <span>if</span>(i == <span>0</span> || nums[i] != nums[i - <span>1</span>]){
            nums[n++] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    <span>return</span> n;
    }
</code></pre><p>This problem has linear time complexity and constant space complexity (it is usually the case for problems solved using this technique).</p>
<h3 id="sort-colorshttpsleetcodecomproblemssort-colors"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/">Sort colors</a></h3>
<p>Given an array with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
Note: You are not supposed to use the library's sort function for this problem.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

</code></pre><p>Since need to traverse the array to sort it, the time complexity is O(N). The space complexity is O(1).</p>
<p>Just as a curiosity, this is an instance of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem">National Dutch flag</a> problem described by Dijkstra.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-n-th-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-listhttpswwwgeeksforgeeksorgnth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/">Remove the n-th node from the end of a linked list</a></h3>
<p>Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n-th node from the end of the Linked List.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>This is one of the most common variations of the two-pointer technique: introducing <strong>an offset</strong> so that one of the pointers reaches a certain condition, the other one is in the position you are interested in.</p>
<p>In this case, if we move one of the pointers, <em>f</em>, n times and then start advancing both at the same time by one node, when <em>f</em> reaches the end of the list the other pointer, <em>s</em>, will point to the node right before the node we want to delete.</p>
<p>Make sure you define what n = 1 means (last element or the element before the last element?), and avoid off-by-one errors.</p>
<p>The time and space complexity are the same as the previous problems'.</p>
<h2 id="2-pointers-moving-at-different-speeds">2. Pointers moving at different speeds</h2>
<p>Now, you will have two pointers moving at different <em>speeds</em>: at every iteration, one of the pointers will advance one node and the other will advance two nodes. We can use this variation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get to the middle element of a linked list</li>
<li>Detect cycles in a linked list</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, it will become clearer once I present some examples.</p>
<h3 id="find-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list-of-unknown-sizehttpsleetcodecomproblemsmiddle-of-the-linked-list"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/">Find the middle node of a linked list of unknown size</a></h3>
<p>Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of the list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: [1,2,3,4,5]</li>
<li>Output: Node 3 from this list</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Solving this problem in 2 passes is easy: on the first pass we compute the size of the list, <em>L</em>, and on the second pass we only advance <em>L/2</em> nodes to find the element at the middle of the list. This approach has linear complexity in time and constant in space.</p>
<p>How can we use 2 pointers to find the middle element in one single pass?</p>
<p>If one of the pointers, <em>f</em>, moves twice as fast as the other one <em>s</em>, when <em>f</em> reaches the end, <em>s</em> will be in the middle of the list.</p>
<p>Here's my solution in C++. Make sure you take into account edge cases (empty list, lists of odd and even sizes, etc) when you test your code.</p>
<pre><code>ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
       ListNode* slow = head;
       ListNode* fast = head;

       <span>while</span> (fast != nullptr &amp;&amp; fast-&gt;<span>next</span> != nullptr) {
           slow = slow-&gt;<span>next</span>;
           fast = fast-&gt;<span>next</span>-&gt;<span>next</span>;
       }
       <span>return</span> slow; 
    }
</code></pre><h2 id="detect-cycle-in-a-linked-listhttpsleetcodecomproblemslinked-list-cycle"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/">Detect cycle in a linked list</a></h2>
<p>Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1</li>

<p>
 On June 26th 2017, Daniel was denied to travel to the US - while still having
 a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. When
 subsequently applying for a visa instead, there has been no response for over
 two years. (To <i>visit</i>, not to apply for permanent residency.)

</p><p> FAQ </p>
<p>
<a href="#long">Do you know why this takes so long?</a>
</p><div>
<p> No. They've just informed me "someone is working on it" and that it "may take a long time" but without qualifying what that means.
</p><p> I've talked to several persons who've experienced similar situations, and
  I've learned about waiting times up to 20 months until a definite "no". I used
  to think of that as a sort of "worst case" waiting time. Now we know it can
  take longer...
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#esta">Why don't you just apply for an ESTA?</a>
</p><p>
  I already did and they denied me that. See one of the <a href="#images">images below</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why did they deny you ESTA?
</p><p>
  I don't know as they won't tell. And I also don't know why they can't respond to my visa application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#working">So, someone is working on it?</a>
</p><p>
  Allegedly, yes. I'm sure that person must be working very hard...
</p>
<p>
<a href="#eventually">Do you think they will grant you a visa eventually?</a>
</p><div>
<p>
  No. I've been in contact with many people who have been in similar
  situations such as this, as well as many people who have applied for visas
  for very complicated matters, and it is basically unheard of that it would
  take this long time and still end up with a positive response in the end.
</p><p>
  Someone emailed me and explained how they got their visa approved after 10
  months waiting - so it obviously <i>can</i> happen after a fairly
  long time!
</p></div>
<p>
<a name="#arab">Did you travel to any arab countries, middle-east, North Korea, Sudan, Iran or Iraq?</a>
</p><p>
 No.
</p>
<p>
<a name="#ever">Did you ever visit the US?</a>
</p><div>
<p> Yes, I've visted the US around a dozen times over a time period of almost
 twenty years. I've applied and gotten ESTA permissions several times. I have
 many friends living and working in the US.
</p><p> My latest visit to the US was in December 2016 - using the same ESTA and
 passport I subsequently wanted to use in the summer of 2017 when I was first
 denied travelling to the US.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#blocked">How many trips have this blocked you from taking so far?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I've been invited personally to several meetings in the US that I couldn't
 attend. (excluding IETF, HTTPbis or QUIC meetings)
</p><ol>
<li> San Francisco June 2017. Mozilla All Hands.
</li><li> San Francisco June 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> San Francisco October 2018. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Orlando, Florida December 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> Portland, Oregon January 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> California, March 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Summer of 2019. Wedding.
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#employer">Can't your employer help you?</a>
</p><p> We've already tried all available ways to get information or otherwise
bring this effort forward. To no avail.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#Mozilla">Will Mozilla move more meetings outside of the US?</a>
</p><p> Yes. Several of the coming All hands are now planned and scheduled to
happen outside of the US, for example in Canada and Germany. But I will not be
there to experience them since I quit Mozilla in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
Will your visa situation change when you've quit Mozilla?
</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no reason to suspect or hope so.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#lost">Maybe they lost your application?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I emailed them in July 2019 just to make sure they just hadn't
 forgot about my case or similar over the past year, and I received their
 reply on August 1st 2019. The response said "I have forwarded your email to
 my supervisor to highlight the problem."  - but then nothing more came.
</p><p> I emailed them again on January 28, 2020.<br>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png">
</p><p>
 They responded very politely:
 </p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner
possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow
immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or
circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the
administrative processing is concluded.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#likely">What do you think is the most likely explanation for this treatment?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I think one of the likelier explantions is that someone somewhere has
 found my name and my code used in some evil or malicious manner and drawn the
 wrong conclusions about how my code ended up there or how I could've been
 involved. Like for example in some malware, virus or other attack software. I
 make tools and code available for free and openly and sometimes those are
 unfortunately used in ways I don't condone.
</p><p> Since they won't tell me why, basically all theories are equally likely.
 We just won't know.
</p></div>
<p>
Any other plausible explanations?
</p><div>
<p> People have mentioned my domain name <b>haxx.se</b> or suggested it is
because I've referred to myself as "a hacker" at times. I find that unlikely
since I used the domain and used the term for decades before this.
</p><p> Others have offered the explanation that the immigration authorities
might've decided that I violated the ESTA rules in a previous visit. I can of
course not know what they think, but I have not violated those rules.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#crime">Convicted of a crime?</a>
</p><p>
No, I've never been convicted of a crime in Sweden and not anywhere else. Not even
charged. Nor have I ever been involved in a lawsuit of any kind.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#license">Can you change the curl license?</a>
</p><div><p>
Lots of people suggest this, most probably in jest, but let me be perfectly
clear: no I won't change the curl license.
</p><ol>
 <li> excluding a specific user would make a license to not be open source anymore
 </li><li> curl has many more copyrights than mine, it would be hard
 </li><li> curl is bigger than me personally, I wouldn't do it anyway
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#covid">But Covid-19?</a>
</p><p>
During the Corona pandemic (starting in spring 2020), the US has closed its
borders for a lot of more people who otherwise would have been allowed
entry. I suspect the visa processing has slowed down during this period since
people can't go there anyway. But I have not been notified about anything and
I still expect to get a rejection at some point. Pandemic or not.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#officials">Have you contacted any US officials?</a>
</p><div><p>
A US citizen friend of mine sent the following text in an email to the
U.S. Congressman Gerry Connolly on September 3, 2020.
</p><pre>Dear Representative Gerry Connolly:
&nbsp;
Could you please help my friend Daniel Stenberg *finally* gain permission to
travel to the US? He has been denied permission to travel to the US for years,
yet there is no cause for it.
&nbsp;
On June 26, 2017, Mr. Stenberg was denied to travel to the US, even though he
had a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. He
then applied for a visa in April 2018, and has *still* not heard anything.
&nbsp;
This is especially galling because is a widely-known leader in the computer
community. He developed and maintains the "curl" program, a program used
worldwide by many software developers and computer system administrators. In
October 2017 he won the "Polhem prize" for his work on curl; in that ceremony
the Swedish king personally handed Daniel a gold medal. In February 2019 he
joined wolfSSL, an American company (he's their only Swedish hire), and yet
he's still not allowed to travel to the US.
&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a confusion about the word "hacker". In the computer
community, a "hacker" is NOT someone who breaks into computers, a hacker
is "a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
particular."  ( IETF RFC 1983, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983).

Mr. Stenberg does *not* break into computers without authorization.
&nbsp;
At the least, the State Department should have asked questions instead of
reflexively denying entry to a world leader in the computer industry.
&nbsp;
More information is available on his personal website:

Thank you very much!

This is my first book, and I have spent months of my weekend time to do the research and write about various patterns pioneered by other expert Julia programmers.  I also feel honored to have Stefan Karpinski write forewords for the book.</p>
<p>If you like the content below, you can support me by buying the book (ISBN: 183864881X), telling your buddies about the book, or even just sending me a note via the official JuliaLang Slack. In addition, any constructive criticism are pleasantly welcomed.  <em>After all, life is a continuous learning process.</em></p>
<p>The Holy Traits pattern is one that I found most interesting with the Julia language as it fully leverages the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY&amp;t=2m18s">multiple dispatch</a> feature.  <strong><em>Happy reading!</em></strong></p>

<p>The holy traits pattern has an interesting name. Some people also call it the <strong>Tim Holy Traits Trick (THTT)</strong>. The pattern is named after <a href="https://github.com/timholy">Tim Holy</a>, who is a long-time contributor to the Julia language and ecosystem.</p>
<p>What are <strong>traits</strong>? In a nutshell, a trait corresponds to the behavior of an object. For example, birds and butterflies can fly, so they both have the <em>CanFly</em> trait. Dolphins and turtles can swim, so they both have the <em>CanSwim</em> trait. A duck can fly and swim, so it has both the <em>CanFly</em> and <em>CanSwim</em> traits. Traits are typically binary – you either exhibit the trait or not – although that is not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Why do we want traits? Traits can be used as a formal contract about how a data type can be used. For example, if an object has the <em>CanFly</em> trait, then we would be quite confident that the object has some kind of <code>fly</code> method defined. Likewise, if an object has the <em>CanSwim</em> trait, then we can probably call some kind of <code>swim</code> function.</p>
<p>Let's get back to programming. The Julia language doesn't have any built-in support for traits. However, the language is versatile enough for developers to use traits with the help of the multiple dispatch system. In this section, we will look into how this can be done with the special technique known as <strong>holy traits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="exploring_the_personal_asset_management_use_case"><a href="#exploring_the_personal_asset_management_use_case">Exploring the personal asset management use case</a></h2>
<p>When designing reusable software, we often create abstractions as data types and associate behaviors with them. One way to model behaviors is to leverage a type hierarchy. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>, we should be able to substitute a type with a subtype when a function is called.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the type hierarchy for managing personal assets.</p>
<p><img data-src=" /assets/pages/design_patterns_book/abstract_type_hier4.png" alt=" Personal Asset Type Hierarchy" src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/design_patterns_book/abstract_type_hier4.png"></p><p>We can define a function called <code>value</code> for determining the value of any asset. Such a function can be applied to all the types in the <code>Asset</code> hierarchy if we assume that all the asset types have some kind of monetary value attached to them. Following that line of thought, we can say that almost every asset exhibits the <em>HasValue</em> trait.</p>
<p>Sometimes, behaviors can only be applied to certain types in the hierarchy. For example, what if we want to define a <code>trade</code> function that only works with liquid investments? In that case, we would define trade functions for <code>Investment</code> and <code>Cash</code> but not for <code>House</code> and <code>Apartments</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A liquid investment refers to a security instrument that can be traded easily in the open market. The investor can quickly convert a liquid instrument into cash and vice versa. In general, most investors would like a portion of their investment to be liquid in the case of an emergency. Investments that are not liquid are called illiquid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programmatically, how do we know which asset types are liquid? One way is to check the type of the object against a list of types that represent liquid investments. Suppose that we have an array of assets and need to find out which one can be traded quickly for cash. In this situation, the code may look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>function show_tradable_assets(assets::Vector{Asset})
    for asset in assets
        if asset isa Investment || asset isa Cash
            println("Yes, I can trade ", asset)
        else
            println("Sorry, ", asset, " is not tradable")
        end
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>The if-condition in the preceding code is a bit ugly, even in this toy example. If we have more types in the condition, then it gets worse. Of course, we can create a union type to make it a little better:</p>
<pre><code>const LiquidInvestments = Union{Investment, Cash}

function show_tradable_assets(assets::Vector{Asset})
    for asset in assets
        if asset isa LiquidInvestments
            println("Yes, I can trade ", asset)
        else
            println("Sorry, ", asset, " is not tradable")
        end
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>There are still a few issues with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The union type has to be updated whenever we add a new liquid asset type. This kind of maintenance is bad from a design perspective because the programmer must remember to update this union type whenever a new type is added to the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This union type is not available for extension. If other developers want to reuse our trading library, then they may want to add new asset types. However, they cannot change our definition of the union type because they do not own the source code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The if-then-else logic may be repeated in many places in our source, whenever we need to do things differently for liquid and illiquid assets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These problems can be solved using the <strong>holy traits</strong> pattern.</p>
<h2 id="implementing_the_holy_traits_pattern"><a href="#implementing_the_holy_traits_pattern">Implementing the Holy Traits pattern</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate the concept of this pattern, we will start looking into the following personal asset data types:</p>
<pre><code>abstract type Asset end

abstract type Property &lt;: Asset end
abstract type Investment &lt;: Asset end
abstract type Cash &lt;: Asset end

abstract type House &lt;: Property end
abstract type Apartment &lt;: Property end

abstract type FixedIncome &lt;: Investment end
abstract type Equity &lt;: Investment end</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> type is at the top of the hierarchy and has the <code>Property</code>, <code>Investment</code>, and <code>Cash</code> subtypes. At the next level, <code>House</code> and <code>Apartment</code> are subtypes of <code>Property</code>, while <code>FixedIncome</code> and <code>Equity</code> are subtypes of <code>Investment</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let's define some concrete types:</p>
<pre><code>struct Residence &lt;: House
   location
end

struct Stock &lt;: Equity
    symbol
    name
end

struct TreasuryBill &lt;: FixedIncome
    cusip
end

struct Money &lt;: Cash
    currency
    amount
end</code></pre>
<p>What do we have here? Let's take a look at these data types in more details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <code>Residence</code> is a house that someone lives in and has a location.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>Stock</code> is an equity investment, which is identified by a trading symbol and the name of the company.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>TreasuryBill</code> is a short-term government-issued form of security in the United States, and it is identified with a standard identifier called CUSIP.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Money</code> is just cash, and we want to store the currency and respective amount here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we have not annotated the types for the fields because they aren't important for illustrating the trait concept here.</p>
<h2 id="defining_the_trait_type"><a href="#defining_the_trait_type">Defining the trait type</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to investments, we can distinguish between ones that can be sold for cash easily in the open market and ones that take considerably more effort and time to convert into cash. Things that can easily be converted into cash within several days are known as being <strong>liquid</strong>, while the hard-to-sell ones are known as being <strong>illiquid</strong>. For example, stocks are liquid while a residence is not.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to do is define the traits themselves:</p>
<pre><code>abstract type LiquidityStyle end
struct IsLiquid &lt;: LiquidityStyle end
struct IsIlliquid &lt;: LiquidityStyle end</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Traits are nothing but regular data types in Julia!</em></strong> The overall concept of the <code>LiquidityStyle</code> trait is just an abstract type. The specific traits, <code>IsLiquid</code> and <code>IsIlliquid</code>, are coded as concrete types without any fields.</p>
<h2 id="identifying_traits"><a href="#identifying_traits">Identifying traits</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to assign data types to these traits. Conveniently, Julia allows us to bulk-assign traits to an entire subtype tree using the <code>&lt;:</code> operator in the function signature:</p>
<pre><code># Default behavior is illiquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type) = IsIlliquid()

# Cash is always liquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type{&lt;:Cash}) = IsLiquid()

# Any subtype of Investment is liquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type{&lt;:Investment}) = IsLiquid()</code></pre>
<p>There is no standard naming convention for traits, but my research seems to indicate that package authors tend to use either "Style" or "Trait" as the suffix for trait types.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how we can interpret these three lines of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the types illiquid by default. Note that we could have done this the other way round and made everything liquid by default. This decision is arbitrary and depends on the specific use case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the subtypes of <code>Cash</code> liquid, which includes the concrete <code>Money</code> type. The notation of <code>::Type{&lt;:Cash}</code> indicates all the subtypes of <code>Cash</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the subtypes of <code>Investment</code> liquid. This includes all the subtypes of <code>FixedIncome</code> and <code>Equity</code>, which covers <code>Stock</code> in this example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing_trait_behavior"><a href="#implementing_trait_behavior">Implementing trait behavior</a></h2>
<p>Now that we can tell which types are liquid and which are not, we can define methods that take objects with those traits. First, let's do something really simple:</p>
<pre><code># The thing is tradable if it is liquid
tradable(x::T) where {T} = tradable(LiquidityStyle(T), x)
tradable(::IsLiquid, x) = true
tradable(::IsIlliquid, x) = false</code></pre>
<p>In Julia, types are first-class citizens. The <code>tradable(x::T) where {T}</code> signature captures the type of argument as <code>T</code>. Since we have already defined the <code>LiquidityStyle</code> function, we can derive whether the passed argument exhibits the <code>IsLiquid</code> or <code>IsIlliquid</code> trait. So, the first <code>tradable</code> method simply takes the return value of <code>LiquidityStyle(T)</code> and passes it as the first argument for the other two <code>tradable</code> methods. This simple example demonstrates the dispatch effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might be wondering why we don't take <code>::Type{&lt;: Asset}</code> as an argument for the default trait function. Doing so makes it more restrictive as the default value would only be available for types that are defined under the Asset type hierarchy. This may or …</p></blockquote></div></div>

It involves numeric summaries, plots, aggregations, distributions, densities, reviewing all the levels of factor variables and applying general statistical methods. A clear understanding of the data provides the foundation for model selection, i.e. choosing the correct machine learning algorithm to solve your problem.</p><p>An extensive exploratory data analysis was done for MLBR which will be available in a separate series of articles soon.</p><h3 id="4-4-feature-engineering">4.4. &nbsp;Feature Engineering</h3><p>Feature engineering is the process of determining which predictor variables will contribute the most to the predictive power of a machine learning algorithm. There are two commonly used methods for making this selection – the Forward Selection Procedure starts with no variables in the model. You then iteratively add variables and test the predictive accuracy of the model until adding more variables no longer makes a positive effect. Next, the Backward Elimination Procedure begins with all the variables in the model. You proceed by removing variables and testing the predictive accuracy of the model.</p><p>Feature engineering is a give-and-take process with exploratory data analysis to provide much needed intuition about the data. It is also very important to have a domain expert at this stage. Risk Collection team has been very supportive in providing domain knowledge through out the project work. </p><p>During exploratory analysis of the historical data, we learned that determining account treatment is widespread in multiple phases of credit life cycle with each phase having several features. Therefore, by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, we came up with an idea of using predictive scores for different phases that should look at</p><ul><li>Behaviour score during collection phase (Collection Score)</li><li>Expert judgement (Expert Score)</li><li>Overall payment history analysis (Repayment Score)</li></ul><h3 id="4-4-1-collection-score">4.4.1. &nbsp;Collection Score</h3><p>Collection specific scoring is designed to predict what will happen in shorter timeframe – the next month or two – using data elements that are proven to be effective during collection phase. Collection Score is an engineered feature that looks at the customer behavior during collection period. The algorithm assigns a base score and then look at several parameters before arriving at the final collection score. The parameters includes number of calls made, contacts made, promise-to-pay (ptp) obtained, ptp kept rate, ptp broken rate, inbound calls, letters sent etc. The algorithm also look at number of ptp taken until first, second and third kept. Similarly, the number of days taken until first, second and third kept. &nbsp;Given below is the density distribution of the Collection Score for different segments of customers.</p><h3 id="4-4-2-repayment-score">4.4.2. &nbsp;Repayment Score</h3><p>This is an engineered feature that calculates customer repaying power by looking into customer historical data before it went to Charge Off. The algorithm developed to calculate Customer Repayment Score does this by looking into forward and backword movement of delinquency age buckets in the last three years before charge off. It looks for number of times customer defaulted, number of times customer recovered back to normal. Before arriving at the final repayment score, the algorithm also calculates customer lifetime value factor based on early stage delinquencies and late stage delinquencies. Given below is the density distribution of the repayment score for different segments of customers.</p><h3 id="4-4-3-expert-score">4.4.3. &nbsp;Expert Score</h3><p>In collections and recovery, determining how best to work accounts is often left to judgement. We acquired the expertise of collection and recoveries team and developed an Expert Opinion Scorecard to rate a customer based on the expert judgment. The scorecard primarily takes into consideration 19 independent variables related to customer demographics, market and product. Each variable is then rated by the expert based on the scale of 1-5 before calculating the final score. Here is the scale:</p><table>

<ol><li><strong><a href="#one-person-media-companies">Building a profitable one-person media company</a></strong> around you and your ideas</li><li><strong><a href="#pour-gasoline-on-your-career">Pouring gasoline on your career</a></strong> by sharing your ideas online</li></ol>



<p>Neither opportunity is “easy” (you have to put in work over a long period of time) and you’ll need to be pretty enthusiastic about your ideas, but the upside is huge.</p>



<p>Also, these opportunities basically did not exist for all of human history…until now. Lucky us.</p>







<p>A one-person media company is exactly what it sounds like: it’s a profitable media company built around the ideas of a single person with at most one or two full-time employees, and often none at all.</p>



<p>This only became possible relatively recently.</p>



<div><p><b>Why Today Is Special</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s now pretty much free to distribute media thanks to the internet</li>
<li>Smartphones, tablets, and e-readers (i.e. always-on and always-online media devices) are affordable and most people have one on them at all times</li>
<li>Because the internet and internet-connected devices have been widely adopted, it’s now possible to reach nearly any niche on Earth (lots of new audiences!)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Production software and hardware have become wildly affordable and accessible</li>
</ul>

</div>



<p>The internet has created an opportunity to build a media company powered by the ideas of a single person, a payroll smaller than a convenience store, and revenues large enough that the company could trade on the NASDAQ.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to do. There’s a lot of competition. It can take a long time. But this is a post about possibilities, not probabilities.</p>



<p>Let’s have some fun and look at the upside potential of one-person media companies.</p>



<h2>The podcast that could trade on the NASDAQ</h2>

<p>In 2007, a relatively unknown Tim Ferriss published <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>.</p>



<p>The book sold well and, year after year, Ferriss continued to blog and publish books and amassed “a monthly audience in the millions or tens of millions.” (<a href="https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/">source</a>)</p>



<p>In 2014, he was burned out from writing books and decided to launch a podcast as <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/04/11/tim-ferriss-podcast-business/">an experiment</a>.</p>



<p>He used less than <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast-gear/">$1,000 worth of equipment</a> and distributed the podcast for free across major podcasting platforms.</p>



<p>He was able to acquire an early enthusiastic following thanks to the audience he had spent years building, but it didn’t take long before the podcast reached far beyond his existing blog and book fans.</p>



<p>Today, <em>The Tim Ferriss Show</em> is one of the most popular podcasts on iTunes.</p>



<p>What you might not know is that <em>The Tim Ferriss Show</em> generates enough revenue from advertising that, were it to make a few structural and governance changes, it would be eligible to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/nasdaq-listing-requirements/">trade on the NASDAQ</a> as a stand-alone company.</p>



<p>In the last three years alone, his podcast has generated <strong>nearly $17 million in revenue.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xStWqvSFccyFu0Z6wqk3Vfbj-GuxMKyf-uKfBTPJlxA/edit?usp=sharing">detailed breakdown</a> of <em>The Tim Ferriss Show’s </em>estimated revenue over the past few years:</p>







<p>Absolutely buck wild.</p>



<p>And it still costs next to nothing to produce the show…&nbsp;</p>



<p>He still uses just $1,000 worth of production equipment and famously leverages <a href="https://tim.blog/4-hour-workweek-tools/">internet-first tools and services</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/@jasongrad/how-i-hired-a-virtual-assistant-stopped-wasting-my-time-and-achieved-10x-results-5feb430e652b">personal assistant</a> to manage the minutiae of his media empire while he’s largely free to focus on content production.</p>



<p>If he took the podcast public, its biggest expense would be the legal and regulatory overhead — not the operational costs of the underlying business.</p>



<p>While the top-line revenue of his podcast wouldn’t blow many NASDAQ companies out of the water, its margins would.</p>

<h2>How do one-person media companies make money?</h2>



<p>Not everybody can or wants to launch a wildly-successful podcast, and that’s fine.</p>



<p>There are plenty of ways to use the internet to build a profitable media company around your ideas. I’ll break down three popular strategies below.</p>



<p>The first two mostly require building a big audience like Ferriss, but the last one doesn’t and can get to profitability quickly.</p>



<h3>1. Advertising and affiliate marketing</h3>



<p>Tim Ferriss makes a mountain of money from advertising.</p>



<p>Companies want to pay to get in front of the big audience he’s built and they’re willing to shell out <a href="https://4hb.wufoo.com/forms/the-tim-ferriss-show-sponsor-interest-form/"><strong>$54,000</strong></a><strong> for a single ad slot</strong> in a single episode of his podcast.</p>



<p>He’s also made a killing with affiliate marketing…</p>



<p>He’ll partner up with a company and get paid whenever his readers or listeners purchase one of their products. You’ve probably noticed these links embedded throughout his blog and email newsletter.</p>



<p>If you can build a huge audience using the internet, you can have an extraordinary, low-overhead advertising business.</p>



<p>It’s not rocket science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, thankfully, it’s far from the only way to get paid to share your ideas online.</p>



<p><em>(p.s. if you don’t want to build a one-person media empire, you can skip ahead to <a href="#pour-gasoline-on-your-career">how sharing your ideas online can help accelerate your career</a>)</em></p>



<h3>2. Book sales and paid speaking gigs</h3>



<p>Many writers or semi-public figures make an envy-inducing living combining book sales with paid speaking gigs.</p>



<p>This used to only be a possibility for people who were already well-known or influential, or an incredibly lucky handful of promising writers who managed to land a book deal.</p>



<p>But now people are using the internet to build their own influence and let the publishers flock to <em>them</em>.  </p>



<p>James Clear is one example. </p>



<p>A few years ago, he was a nobody. </p>



<p>Here’s one of his first tweets:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Just a handful of likes. Sad!</p>



<p>But he used an aggressive SEO and <a href="http://mediashift.org/2015/01/how-a-self-help-blog-generated-100000-email-subscribers/">email list-building strategy</a> to go from unknown to internet-famous in just a few years.</p>



<p>Over <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1250538237225046018">715,000 people</a> now subscribe to his weekly newsletter alone. </p>



<p>Wild.</p>



<p>But despite having a big audience, he’s shunned advertising and has largely optimized his business around book sales and speaking engagements.</p>



<p>He leveraged his email list to get a book deal with a major publisher and launch the NY Times bestseller <a href="https://amzn.to/3b8mubD"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (over 1M copies sold).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And <strong>his</strong> <strong>speaking fees are now approaching that of some </strong><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/former-presidents-speaking-fees-3368127"><strong>former U.S. presidents</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p>



<p>It costs <a href="https://speakerexchangeagency.com/portfolio/james-clear/">tens of thousands of dollars</a> to get him to show up to your next event — a fee that he’s been able to increase in lockstep with his audience growth.</p>



<p>If there’s a formula here, it goes something like:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Use the internet to build an audience and momentum around your ideas</li><li>Roll that momentum into a book deal</li><li>Use your book to make money <em>and</em> build your credibility</li><li>Use your credibility to increase your speaking fees and help grow your audience even more&nbsp;</li></ol>

<p>The one big drawback of the book/speaking and advertising models are that they typically need a big audience before they start working well.</p>



<p>There’s a third business model, though, that doesn’t require an army of enthusiastic fans and is filled with success stories…</p>



<h3>3. Paid content and online courses</h3>



<p>The internet is filled with people you’ve never heard of who are making a living, and in many cases a <em>killing</em>, sharing their expertise on a narrow, deep topic.</p>



<p>They’ll likely never make as much as a Tim Ferriss, but I mean who cares? There are some stunning success stories of no-name people striking gold within a niche.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> is one. He’s built a one-person media company around his programming tutorials, online classes, and e-books.</p>



<p>Check out his sales over the past 4 years (the 2nd tweet below):</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yep +1 have sold $4m worth of PDFs/videos to developers since I started working on my first book in 2016. Developers are an amazing audience 👍🏻</p>— Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1244654205836632069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He did not hire legions of full-time employees to help him hit $4 million in sales. He just kept pushing out educational videos and PDFs that he produced and distributed himself.</p>



<p>And, by the way, he’s no Steven Spielberg. Many of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1H38XrN7hi7wHSClfXPqQ">his videos</a> are him just recording a screencast for 30 minutes as he debugs some obscure programming issue.</p>



<p>Another well-paid expert is Ben Thompson, whose paid newsletter <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> brings in over $2,500,000 each year from tech investors and entrepreneurs who pay for a subscription. (<a href="https://twitter.com/AnthPB/status/1230510555343052800">source</a>)</p>



<p>The headcount for his multi-million-dollar-per-year business?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Himself and a personal assistant.</p>



<p>Pure madness.</p>



<p>Here’s the rough playbook:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is the age of one-person media companies.</p><p>Here’s the business model:</p><p>• Build an email list.<br>• Grow your list with free content.<br>• Monetize with a subscription.<br>• Fans pay for podcasts, ask-me-anything episodes, and behind-the-scenes videos.</p><p>Small teams. Big margins.</p></div>— ᴅᴀᴠɪᴅ ᴘᴇʀᴇʟʟ ✌ (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1249806519052283904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The internet gives you an unprecedented opportunity to turn your knowledge into information products that you can sell to nearly any company or person on Earth who needs it.</p>



<h3>4. The swiss army knife approach</h3>



<p>In reality, many one-person media companies use a combination of business models.</p>



<p>Despite shunning advertising, James Clear embeds affiliate links for any books he recommends. He also sells an online course about habits.</p>



<p>But therein lies the beauty of the one-person media company…</p>



<p><strong>There are </strong><a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0011-paid-newsletters"><strong>tons of creative ways</strong></a><strong> to turn your ideas into money. </strong>You can use whichever ones make the most sense for your particular goal or situation.</p>



<h2 id="pour-gasoline-on-your-career">2. Pour gasoline on your career</h2>



<p>Maybe you don’t want to quit your job to start podcasting, blogging, or recording videos for 40 hours each week.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there’s a much more practical reason why some of us might want to start sharing our ideas online (and you can do it in your spare time):</p>

<p><span>

27 Feb 2020

</span></p><p>In 2018, I wrote an article “Writing an efficient Vulkan renderer” for GPU Zen 2 book, which was published in 2019. In this article I tried to aggregate as much information about Vulkan performance as I could - instead of trying to focus on one particular aspect or application, this is trying to cover a wide range of topics, give readers an understanding of the behavior of different APIs on real hardware and provide a range of options for each problem that needs to be solved.</p>

<p>At the time of publishing this article, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GPU-Zen-Advanced-Rendering-Techniques-ebook/dp/B07SYP7P6B">Kindle edition of the book</a> is available for $2.99 on Amazon - that’s cheaper than a cup of coffee and it’s definitely worth your time and money. It contains many great articles about rendering effects and design.</p>

<p>This, however, is the full, free of charge copy of the article - hopefully it will help graphics programmers to understand and use Vulkan to the full of its ability. The article has been lightly edited to mention Vulkan 1.1/1.2 promotions where applicable - fortunately, not much has changed in the last two years for Vulkan performance, so the content should still be mostly accurate.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Vulkan is a new explicit cross-platform graphics API. It introduces many new concepts that may be unfamiliar to even seasoned graphics programmers. The key goal of Vulkan is performance – however, attaining good performance requires in-depth knowledge about these concepts and how to apply them efficiently, as well as how particular driver implementations implement these. This article will explore topics such as memory allocation, descriptor set management, command buffer recording, pipeline barriers, render passes and discuss ways to optimize CPU and GPU performance of production desktop/mobile Vulkan renderers today as well as look at what a future looking Vulkan renderer could do differently.</p>

<p>Modern renderers are becoming increasingly complex and must support many different graphics APIs with varying levels of hardware abstraction and disjoint sets of concepts. This sometimes makes it challenging to support all platforms at the same level of efficiency. Fortunately, for most tasks Vulkan provides multiple options that can be as simple as reimplementing concepts from other APIs with higher efficiency due to targeting the code specifically towards the renderer needs, and as hard as redesigning large systems to make them optimal for Vulkan. We will try to cover both extremes when applicable – ultimately, this is a tradeoff between maximum efficiency on Vulkan-capable systems and implementation and maintenance costs that every engine needs to carefully pick. Additionally, efficiency is often application-dependent – the guidance in this article is generic and ultimately best performance is achieved by profiling the target application on a target platform and making an informed implementation decision based on the results.</p>

<p>This article assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of Vulkan API, and would like to understand them better and/or learn how to use the API efficiently.</p>



<p>Memory management remains an exceedingly complex topic, and in Vulkan it gets even more so due to the diversity of heap configurations on different hardware. Earlier APIs adopted a resource-centric concept – the programmer doesn’t have a concept of graphics memory, only that of a graphics resource, and different drivers are free to manage the resource memory based on API usage flags and a set of heuristics. Vulkan, however, forces to think about memory management up front, as you must manually allocate memory to create resources.</p>

<p>A perfectly reasonable first step is to integrate <code>VulkanMemoryAllocator</code> (henceforth abbreviated as VMA), which is an open-source library developed by AMD that solves some memory management details for you by providing a general purpose resource allocator on top of Vulkan functions. Even if you do use that library, there are still multiple performance considerations that apply; the rest of this section will go over memory caveats without assuming you use VMA; all of the guidance applies equally to VMA.</p>

<h2 id="memory-heap-selection">Memory heap selection</h2>

<p>When creating a resource in Vulkan, you have to choose a heap to allocate memory from. Vulkan device exposes a set of memory types where each memory type has flags that define the behavior of that memory, and a heap index that defines the available size.</p>

<p>Most Vulkan implementations expose two or three of the following flag combinations<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> – this is generally referring to GPU memory that is not directly visible from CPU; it’s fastest to access from the GPU and this is the memory you should be using to store all render targets, GPU-only resources such as buffers for compute, and also all static resources such as textures and geometry buffers.</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> – on AMD hardware, this memory type refers to up to 256 MB of video memory that the CPU can write to directly, and is perfect for allocating reasonable amounts of data that is written by CPU every frame, such as uniform buffers or dynamic vertex/index buffers</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>  – this is referring to CPU memory that is directly visible from GPU; reads from this memory go over PCI-express bus. In absence of the previous memory type, this generally speaking should be the choice for uniform buffers or dynamic vertex/index buffers, and also should be used to store staging buffers that are used to populate static resources allocated with <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> with data.</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT</code> – this is referring to GPU memory that might never need to be allocated for render targets on tiled architectures. It is recommended to use lazily allocated memory to save physical memory for large render targets that are never stored to, such as MSAA images or depth images.
On integrated GPUs, there is no distinction between GPU and CPU memory – these devices generally expose <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> that you can allocate all static resources through as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>When dealing with dynamic resources, in general allocating in non-device-local host-visible memory works well – it simplifies the application management and is efficient due to GPU-side caching of read-only data. For resources that have a high degree of random access though, like dynamic textures, it’s better to allocate them in <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> and upload data using staging buffers allocated in <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> memory – similarly to how you would handle static textures. In some cases you might need to do this for buffers as well – while uniform buffers typically don’t suffer from this, in some applications using large storage buffers with highly random access patterns will generate too many PCIe transactions unless you copy the buffers to GPU first; additionally, host memory does have higher access latency from the GPU side that can impact performance for many small draw calls.</p>

<p>When allocating resources from <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code>, in case of VRAM oversubscription you can run out of memory; in this case you should fall back to allocating the resources in non-device-local <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> memory. Naturally you should make sure that large frequently used resources such as render targets are allocated first. There are other things you can do in an event of an oversubscription, such as migrating resources from GPU memory to CPU memory for less frequently used resources – this is outside of the scope of this article; additionally, on some operating systems like Windows 10 correct handling of oversubscription requires APIs that are not currently available in Vulkan.</p>

<h2 id="memory-suballocation">Memory suballocation</h2>

<p>Unlike some other APIs that allow an option to perform one memory allocation per resource, in Vulkan this is impractical for large applications – drivers are only required to support up to 4096 individual allocations. In addition to the total number being limited, allocations can be slow to perform, may waste memory due to assuming worst case possible alignment requirements, and also require extra overhead during command buffer submission to ensure memory residency. Because of this, suballocation is necessary. A typical pattern of working with Vulkan involves performing large (e.g. 16 MB – 256 MB depending on how dynamic the memory requirements are) allocations using <code>vkAllocateMemory</code>, and performing suballocation of objects within this memory, effectively managing it yourself. Critically, the application needs to handle alignment of memory requests correctly, as well as <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> limit that restricts valid configurations of buffers and images.</p>

<p>Briefly, <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> restricts the relative placement of buffer and image resources in the same allocation, requiring additional padding between individual allocations. There are several ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always over-align image resources (as they typically have larger alignment to begin with) by bufferImageGranularity, essentially using a maximum of required alignment and <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> for address and size alignment.</li>
  <li>Track resource type for each allocation, and have the allocator add the requisite padding only if the previous or following resource is of a different type. This requires a somewhat more complex allocation algorithm.</li>
  <li>Allocate images and buffers in separate Vulkan allocations, thus sidestepping the entire problem. This reduces internal fragmentation due to smaller alignment padding but can waste more memory if the backing allocations are too big (e.g. 256 MB).</li>
</ul>

<p>On many GPUs the required alignment for image resources is substantially bigger than it is for buffers which makes the last option attractive – in addition to reducing waste due to lack of extra …</p></div></div>

<p>Lately I’ve been slowly reading “Graffiti Kings: New York Transit Art of the 1970s” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Stewart_(artist)">Jack Stewart</a>. I’m reading it because I’ve always been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art">pop art</a>, and as I’ve started to understand more about its context during its period, I also want to understand graffiti and street art better.</p>
<p>For me this is personally linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demo- and introscene</a>, which, as far as I’m concerned is art, and I think its context links pretty well into current digital art and scarcity which is now possible with blockchains, explored by, among others, <a href="https://async.art/">async art</a> and <a href="https://superrare.co/">SuperRare</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve dived into and built a better understanding of this type of art, you begin noticing the details that make it unique. You begin developing a vocabulary for describing it, and you begin to understanding what makes it good or bad, what distinguishes it and its style.</p>
<p>It is like this with programming languages as well. Having been a developer for more or less 20 years, you begin noticing these details. What, to the untrained eye, is just some complex text in “notepad,” becomes beautiful patterns.</p>
<p>Programming is often described as both an art form and a science. </p>
<p>There’s certainly a science to the best practice usage of patterns, which help developers become more efficient and less error prone, by reconciling what they should be doing, under certain conditions.</p>
<p>But this is not the patterns I mention. Instead it is the beauty of a structure more generic and succinct. For me, a few years back, after getting a bit lost in the industrial complex of your usual language selection, I was revitalized by <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. As a lisp, it was different, something new, and something which allowed me to rediscover why I originally fell in love with programming. It made me a better developer, because it moved me away from the mass produced “art” of your standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, and towards a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Having spend some time with Clojure, I feel I can now look back and fundamentally appreciate its beauty. I can see the art in its patterns, I can feel the quality of its meaning. <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html">I’ve been enlightened</a>. It doesn’t mean I’m capable of creating a perfectly minimal and generalized lisp structure, but maybe I’m able to spot one when I see it.</p>
<p>With this chance to appreciate this level of beauty within a few lines of text, maybe it also makes me an overall better critic in the more mainstream domain of programming languages.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve fairly recently become a big fan of <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, simply because it allows me to often describe with similar levels of succinctness, what I want to code, while it at the same time is an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism">practical</a> and forgiving language. It’s a good approximation for both worlds. It’s moving us forward, giving us better tools.</p>
<p>That is a form of beauty which is slightly different than the lisp, but still high quality programming language art as far as I’m concerned. It gives me the same fundamental good feeling about what we’re trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>Sure, it doesn’t have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> or the immutable persistent data structures by default. But how could it have those things while being practical?</p>
<p>If we want to bring the general understanding of programming languages, from the point of view of it as an art form, forward, we need to make it immediately practical. It can’t be just another hack hobby project, but something with underlying knowledge guiding its design and intent.</p>
<p>It needs to bring this beauty while at the same time solve those everyday mundane programming tasks served up by the industrial complex of generic software development. Only then can the general understanding of programming as an art form gain a broader platform.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><p>A friend later suggested that I should've responded like so 😅:</p><blockquote>Hi, I'm from the IRGC secret intelligence <em>🕵️‍♂️</em>, we just wanted to test your loyalty to the regime, therefore we create fake accounts. You can merge the PR without any problem</blockquote><p>💡 🙃</p><h3>OpenSource, Earth</h3><p>Meanwhile, a few days later somebody posted this on <a href="https://insin.github.io/react-hn/#/story/24364793?_k=l43je0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>, and it was trending on the top of the list. People were discussing if the Iranian violated GitHub's TOS, and how an Iranian is using GitHub when Iran is currently under US sanctions.</p><p>Another interesting development - <a href="https://github.com/behdad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Behdad Esfahbod</a>, an Iranian/Canadian open-source programmer, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Behdad_Esfahbod" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well known</a> for his very large open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HarfBuzz</a>, (who recently <a href="https://medium.com/@behdadesfahbod/if-you-read-one-thing-from-me-please-be-this-2262ec7b8af2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had an ordeal</a> with the IRGC) <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9#issuecomment-686413931" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commented on the repo</a>: <strong>Just merge it.</strong> Soon after that, the PR was suddenly locked for conversation by the owner.</p><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2d494840426d5a425f46425e004246594c034e4240">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>

INT ib         1  2
INTO           1  4
INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

<p>Neural language models like BERT, XLNet, and GPT-3 picked up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/artificial-intelligence-aristo-passed-test.html">headline-grabbing</a> steam over the last couple of years. Why is this?</p>
<p>The machine learning algorithms for common NLP tasks like entity recognition and question answering typically require feature vectors as input. Natural language inputs are represented as vectors, and from this point we train models to classify text, cluster documents, answer questions, and the like.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A considerable amount of research over the past decade has demonstrated the importance of language modeling as a driver for the ultimate quality of the downstream NLP task models.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The statistical language models of last century like <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-bag-of-words-model-b88fc4f4971">bag-of-words</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a> effectively capped the state of the art well below “earth-shattering” for many NLP tasks, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete">AI-hard</a> NLP tasks that captivate us. I remember first playing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_Fish_(website)#History">Babel Fish</a> machine translation engine in the late 1990s and concluding that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a> was a long way away — Babel Fish often felt more like a word-by-word dictionary lookup engine than a language understanding and translation AI.</p>
<p>The aforementioned cap has since lifted (arguably disappeared) for many NLP tasks, and we constantly experience the benefits firsthand when we search the web or talk to Alexa. NLP advancements exploded in 2018 as a new class of language models arrived: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMo</a> based on LSTMs, followed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> based on the transformer architecture.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> The New Idea of these language models is in their dependency on word context; whereas previous non-contextual word embeddings like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf">word2vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> encode a given word into exactly one vector, the Sesame Street models are designed to capture language nuance in ways that non-contextual word embeddings can’t by definition. (Can you spot an example in this sentence that would be problematic for word2vec, or are you seeing spots?)</p>
<h3 id="neural-language-model-training-cost">Neural Language Model Training Cost</h3>
<p>State-of-the-art language models can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08900.pdf">astronomically expensive</a> to train. Models like BERT and XLNet learn 100s of millions of parameters and the compute cost to train many neural language models from scratch is prohibitive for most organizations. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237">XLNet</a> required training for 5.5 days on 512 TPU v3’s. The cost to replicate this on GCP would be over $500,000.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Language model complexity and training cost is only increasing — OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, introduced in May 2020, learns 175 billion parameters and is estimated to have cost <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/01/ai-machine-learning-openai-gpt-3-size-isnt-everything/">over $12M to train</a>.</p>

<center>An example sequential transfer learning workflow for NLP. Often costly pretraining produces a generally useful language model that is adapted to solve a specific downstream NLP task. Source for model images:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding</a></center>
<p>Thanks to the research community and the organizations backing language model research, high-quality pretrained models are freely available for anyone to use.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Not only are model checkpoints available, but the broader ML library ecosystem makes it straightforward to use these pretrained models in your framework of choice with just a few lines of code. As a result, the aforementioned sequential transfer learning approach to NLP tasks is easy to implement <em>on a reasonable budget</em>. In our case, we trained BERT for SQuAD to produce a model that can extract answers to questions about a given passage. Each experiment required under $20 of compute cost to train on GCP, <em>and</em> we achieve high quality F1 scores in the 87-89% range. For comparison’s sake, human performance is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05250.pdf">86.8%</a>, and state of the art is <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/">93%</a>.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="baseline-single-gpu-training">Baseline Single GPU Training</h3>
<p>Let’s start by training a BERT model for SQuAD on a single GPU. In <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/examples/experimental/trial/bert_squad_pytorch">this PyTorch example</a>, we use Hugging Face’s <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#run_squadpy-fine-tuning-on-squad-for-question-answering">Transformers</a> library’s pretrained model, featurization and data loading methods, and reference hyperparameters. Training for about 2 epochs on a single GPU yields an F1 score of 88.4% on the validation dataset. Not bad at all… but it took well over 7 hours to train! That’s a <em>long</em> time to wait for results, and this is only one well-trodden benchmark NLP task with fixed hyperparameters. If you or your team need to train on more data, tune hyperparameters, train models for other NLP tasks, or develop and debug models for custom downstream tasks, spending a day or longer to train each model would grind progress to a crawl.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-and-conquering">Dividing and Conquering</h3>
<p>In the remainder of this post, we show how to use <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/distributed-training.html">Determined’s distributed training features</a> to perform the same training task about <strong>14 times faster</strong>, while achieving the same model accuracy! In the process, we’ll surface the key factors affecting scaling performance and offer practical guidance for effective distributed training.</p>
<p>Thanks to Determined’s <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/standardized-models-with-determined/">standardized model paradigm</a>, <em>training a model on multiple GPUs requires no code changes</em>. Every result that follows, whether training with 2 GPUs on a single machine or 16 GPUs across multiple machines, only required a configuration change.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can train the same model above in a lunch break rather than a full workday, by utilizing distributed training on Determined. In this blog, we focus on optimizing the training loop. In part 2, we will focus on other components of the training workflow that impact overall runtime, namely data loading and validation. To that end, the following wall clock times are net of data loading and validation.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="initial-results">Initial Results</h3>
<p>The following graph and table show wall clock training time as we scale from 1 to 8 NVIDIA K80 GPUs,<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> all on a single machine on GCP. For these experiments, we fixed both the per-GPU batch size and the total number of epochs to train.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/dtrain_graph.png" alt="Training Time vs. GPUs"></p>

</table>
<p>This is a decent initial result — we aren’t achieving linear scaling, but our scaling efficiency remains above 80%, and also we managed to get wall clock training time for the BERT SQuAD model down to an hour. We achieved an F1 score of 87-88% on the validation dataset for all four experiments.</p>
<h3 id="doing-better-gradient-aggregation-and-radam">Doing Better: Gradient Aggregation and RAdam</h3>
<p>In our results above, there is a clear downward trend in scaling efficiency as we increase the degree of training parallelism. What’s going on there? Maybe we can live with the results at this scale, but what if we had a much heavier-weight training workload that we wanted to distribute across 64 GPUs? The trend is not playing in our favor.</p>
<p>A natural theory for what might be happening is that training is communication-bound. To distribute training over 8 GPUs, Determined divides the training dataset into 8 shards, independently trains 8 models (one per GPU) for a minibatch, and then aggregates and communicates gradient updates so that all 8 copies of the model have the same weights. Then we repeat this process of forward &amp; backward pass followed by gradient aggregation, for every batch.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> As we discuss in our blog <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/distributed-deep-learning-that-actually-works/">here</a> and in our product documentation <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/topic-guides/effective-distributed-training.html#effective-distributed-training">here</a>, communication-reducing techniques like large batch training can help to reduce wall clock training time. Such techniques are particularly promising when GPUs are connected via PCI-E as opposed to higher-bandwidth (yet more expensive) NVLink.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Let’s see if this theory plays out for our model. With Determined, you can adjust your per-slot batch size with a configuration change, though bear in mind that even small increases can quickly exhaust GPU memory because the intermediate state needed for the forward and backward pass scale with the size of the model and are <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-break-gpu-memory-boundaries-even-with-large-batch-sizes-7a9c27a400ce">linearly dependent</a> on the batch size. Instead, we kept GPU memory requirements moderate in order to run on lower cost NVIDIA K80s. We accomplished this by leveraging a Determined distributed training optimization that reduces both inter-GPU communication and per-GPU memory requirements. This <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/reference/experiment-config.html#optimizations">aggregation frequency</a> configuration option specifies the number of forward and backward passes to perform before communicating gradient updates across GPUs. In the following table, we see that increasing our aggregation frequency definitely helps runtime:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aggregation Frequency</th>
<th>Wall Clock Time Savings (minutes)</th>
<th>Validation F1</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>87.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>85</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>31</td>
<td>52.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That’s great — if we can cut 31 minutes off of training time, our per-GPU scaling efficiency goes from 0.93 to a perfect 1. I left something out though — for the 3 rows above, our validation dataset F1 scores are 87.3%, 85%, and (gulp) 52.1%, respectively.</p>
<p>So close, and yet so far. What is happening here? Large batch stochastic gradient descent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf">doesn’t always “just work”</a>; in particular, it’s difficult to find the learning rate sweet spot in this setting. Sometimes, the Linear Scaling Rule works, where if we multiple the batch size by <em>k</em>, we also multiply the (previously tuned) learning rate by <em>k</em>. In our case, using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/optimizer_schedules.html#adamw-pytorch">AdamW</a> optimizer, linear scaling did not help at all; in fact, our F1 scores were even worse when applying the Linear Scaling Rule. Learning rate warmup strategies can also help, where smaller learning rates are used early in large-batch training. In our experience, though, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265v1">RAdam</a> optimizer is a better bet that performs robustly for large batch training without the need for extensive learning rate tuning. When we swap in <a href="https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/RAdam/tree/master/radam">this RAdam implementation</a>, our results look much better:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Aggregation Frequency</th>
<th>Wall Clock Time Savings (minutes)</th>

		<p>You probably know me. Or someone like me. The guy who always raises his hand in class or who has a question or comment regarding whatever idea is being discussed. You might find people like me annoying. I’ve never understood why there seems to be so few of us though. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve wanted to question things; to figure out <em>why</em> or <em>how</em>. Unfortunately, it seems most people don’t. Or rather, it seems as though people are afraid of asking questions. Whether it is from fear of showing that they don’t know or from not wanting to take up other people’s time or something else entirely, I’ve never been able to understand. I do know, however, that it disturbs me.</p>

<p>There are many quotes on questions, like “better to ask and be thought a fool for five minutes than to remain a fool forever” and the likes, but to me, there is something deeper than that. Asking questions often reveals a lot more information than just the answer to the question, almost regardless of the situation. At university, questions can not only reveal errors in the material, but they can spawn discussions on aspects of the topic that suddenly makes it so much clearer why things have to be the way they are. If you strive to understand, questions tend to give a deeper understanding of what’s going on than trying to fill the gaps yourself.</p>

<p>Questions are important in the professional world as well, whether to make clients think properly through the problem they are presenting you with so you don’t go solving the wrong problem or to your peers to come up with the best solution to a problem. I’ve lost count of the number of times a solution has been accepted simply because no-one asked questions at the time it was proposed, only for it to later turn out that it was a terrible solution, and several people in the group saw that it was. This is not because the person with the original idea was an idiot, but rather because there was no feedback process. Without questions, without questioning, ideas are never refined. They need critique and thought, things that are incurred by asking questions.</p>

<p>Indeed, even in personal relationships, questions are important. Asking others questions about themselves serves both to show them that you care, but also for you to learn more about that person. And not only whatever the answer to the question is; you often learn a great deal more about a person simply from digging a little bit. One question often turns into a deeper conversation. Even asking others questions about yourself can be hugely rewarding; what better way of getting a better understanding of how people perceive you than to ask? Many might find this difficult because they are afraid of what they might learn, but if you truly want to improve yourself as a person, then asking is the best way of finding out where you should start.</p>

<p>So, given all the benefits asking questions have, why are there so few people like me? Why is it that there’s “that one person always raising his hand” or that “that one person always questioning people’s ideas”? Why is it that during lectures, I’m the only one who asks questions nearly every time? Why is it that such a low fraction of people account for such a large fraction of the questions? I refuse to believe that other people aren’t curious or have doubts about things. My deepest fear is that people just don’t care. That they don’t care how a particular project turns out or whether they get a complete understanding of whatever is being taught in a lecture. They just want to get by. This is a terrible, terrible attitude, one that inhibits innovation and exploration. Come on people, raise your hands and speak your mind! Develop. Learn. Explore. Question. Care! Or go do something else.</p>

<p>(back-ported from Medium - May 19, 2019)</p>

<p>I used to get rather upset about how I was born so late into the game of computer science. I mean look at it, all the coolest stuff that involves computer science fundamentals we learned in school have all been invented — programming languages, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, storage systems, cryptography, computer graphics, world wide web, etc. Our day-to-day job involves taking these wonderful tools built by other brilliant people and then stitching them together with if/else statements. Everything is becoming a blackbox and these boxes just keep on getting bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>binaries → high level languages &amp; frameworks</li>
<li>formal proof → chaos monkey</li>
<li>on-prem → cloud</li>
<li>decision trees → neural networks</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of how high the piles of abstraction are, there is simply no way to understand everything. So we have no choice but to use the lazy evaluation approach — where we trust the systems and tools to work, and only when it doesn’t will we then start digging into the layers of abstraction in an attempt to understand and fix the problem. If we are lucky, we can dig all the way to the root of the problem. Other times it is a true blackbox (be it due to a mental constraint, like neural networks, where our brain simply doesn’t have that kind of capability to process all the information; or be it due to a physical constraint, like cloud products, where the source code is locked away as trade secrets), where all we could do is trial and error — we form an arbitrary hypothesis, run it against the box, and check its output to see if matches the hypothesis. And perhaps with this newly concluded confirmation bias we fixed the problem, but we still don’t fully understand the box so we are left with a hint of sadness. Theoretically we could build everything from scratch, but working in the industry means productivity is king; we certainly won’t be at our jobs for long if we insisted on doing that.</p>

<p>It took my ego a while to accept this reality. But once I did, I realized: how close-minded of me to think that all the coolest things have been invented! The point of invention is that it does not exist yet. So that assumption all the coolest things have been invented is absurd (and cocky). Instead, the area for innovations simply moved up in the abstraction layer, while I grudgingly stayed below. I learned to marvel at the existing robustness and intricacy of the systems and tools we already have, and at the same time try to take learnings from it in attempt to identify gaps and improve the ecosystem further.</p>

<p>Thinking on a higher level today, there are so many potential areas for improvements off the top of my head (from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer, so these ideas are rather limited in scope):</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are the most popular programming languages still designed for a single machine and have to rely on libraries built on top of application protocols to communicate between machines? I could imagine a rise of distributed + declarative programming languages in the near future that abstract all that away.</li>
<li>Why are we still stuck on application protocols like HTTP/FTP/etc. anyways? I could imagine higher level of protocols that communicate more with less code/data.</li>
<li>Why are we replicating data on so many heterogenous storage systems in order to optimize for different use patterns. I can imagine a one-size-fits-many database in the future which stores the data once but leverage machine learning to optimize for different usage patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I have come to accept my fate as a millennial software engineer that stands on the shoulder of giants and stitches their work together, because I realized that the giants before us were no different — they were also building abstraction layers on top of the work known before them. There is always room for innovation, as long as one sets the mind to it. This is what I love about this field of work — formulating ideas and then making them concrete via code.</p>

However, when we look at our <em>repertoire of functions</em>, we see that something else is missing, namely:</p><blockquote><p>What about the functions constructed via <strong>exponentiation</strong>?</p></blockquote><p>Here, prompted by an <em>unusual</em> sense of urgency, we proceed to toy around with the idea of <em>derivative of a power</em>, subsequently ending up developing a rule precisely for that purpose. The name? <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> of course! Now, we bet that you haven’t seen this one yet — at least not in a standard calculus textbook or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus?t=table-of-contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a> anyway!</p><h2 id="theory"><span id="Exponent_Rule_for_Derivative_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Exponent Rule for Derivative — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p>Given a <strong>base function</strong>&nbsp;$f$ and an <strong>exponent function</strong> $g$ — both defined on an interval $I$ — one&nbsp;can construct&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>power function</strong>&nbsp;$f^g$ (i.e., $f$ raised to $g$),&nbsp;which is defined as long as&nbsp;$f(x)&gt;0$ on $I$ (<a href="https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/#terms">why?</a>). In which&nbsp;case, the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/"><strong>properties of logarithm</strong></a> warrant that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x)^{g(x)} &amp; = e^{\ln \left[ f(x)^{g(x)} \right] } = e^{g(x) \ln f(x)} \end{align*}</p><p>which suggests that $\displaystyle&nbsp;e^{g(x) \ln f(x)}$ and $\displaystyle f(x)^{g(x)}$ can be used interchangeably on $I$.</p><p>More importantly though, in the case where $f$ and $g$ are <em>both differentiable</em> on $I$, using&nbsp;a combination of <strong>Chain Rule</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Product Rule</strong>, we get that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \left(&nbsp;f(x)^{g(x)} \right)’ &amp; = \left(&nbsp;e^{g(x) \ln f(x)} \right)’ \\ &amp; = e^{g(x) \ln f(x)} \, [g(x) \ln f(x)]’ \\ &amp; = f(x)^{g(x)} \left[ g'(x) \ln f(x) +&nbsp;f'(x) \frac{ g(x)}{f(x)} \right] \end{align*}</p><p>Too much $f$ and $g$? No&nbsp;worry. All we have shown is that the derivative of $f^g$ can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$&nbsp;— and hence the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> for derivatives!</p><div><p>Theorem — The Exponent Rule for Derivative</p><div><p>Given a <strong>base</strong> function $f$ and an <strong>exponent</strong> function $g$, if:</p><ol><li>The <strong>power function</strong> $f^g$ is <em>well-defined</em> on an interval $I$ (i.e.,$f$ and $g$ both well-defined on $I$, with $f&gt;0$ on $I$)</li><li>Both $f$ and $g$ are <em>differentiable</em> on $I$</li></ol><p>then the function $f^g$ is <em>differentiable</em>&nbsp;on $I$ as well.

With the advent of the Exponent Rule, both of these approaches basically become obsolete — not because they are irrelevant per se, but because they&nbsp;have&nbsp;already been carried out&nbsp;<em>during</em> the derivation of the Exponent Rule.</p><p>In what follows, we lay out&nbsp;7 examples illustrating how the Exponent Rule can be used to&nbsp;<em>streamline</em> the differentiation process for <strong>power functions</strong>, thereby freeing up some of our brainpower and resources&nbsp;to other potentially-more-challenging tasks that are yet to come.</p><h3 id="ex1"><span id="Example_1_%E2%80%94_$%5Cpi%5Ex$"></span><a href="#toc">Example 1 — $\pi^x$</a><span></span></h3><p>With the base function being $\pi$ and the exponent function $x$, the exponential function $\pi^x$ — which is defined on the <em>entire</em> real line&nbsp;— easily satisfies the <em>preconditions</em> laid out by the Exponent Rule. In which case, differentiating it using the Rule yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} (\pi^x)’ &amp; = \pi^x \left[ (x)’ \ln \pi + (\pi)’ \frac{x}{\pi} \right] = \pi^x \ln \pi \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})\end{align*}</p><p>which shows that $\pi^x$ differentiates to itself along&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;<em>adjustment factor</em> — a typical behavior among the&nbsp;exponential functions.</p><p>Now, is that a&nbsp;<em>heavy-handed</em> differentiation approach to a&nbsp;particularly-simple function? Actually, not really, for as it turns out, the alternative approaches would have been essentially the same&nbsp;— save perhaps a few more extra <em>“patching” steps</em>.</p><p>Finally, to&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;our first <em>successful</em> execution of the Exponent Rule, we’ve cooked up the graphs of $\pi^x$ and its derivative here:</p><figure id="attachment_6618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6618"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/pi^x.png" alt="The exponential function pi^x (red) and its derivative (green)" width="1020" height="716" title=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6618">$\pi^x$ in <span>red</span>, and its derivative in <span>green</span>.

However, this is really more of a blessing than a curse, as $\mathbb{R_+}$ happens to be the <em>biggest</em> domain under which both the base and the exponent function are differentiable anyway. In which case, applying the&nbsp;<strong>Exponent Rule</strong> yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} (x^{\ln x})’ &amp; = x^{\ln x} \left[ (\ln x)’ (\ln x) + (x)’\frac{\ln x}{x} \right] \\ &amp; = x^{\ln x} \left[ \frac{\ln x}{x} + \frac{\ln x}{x} \right] \\ &amp; = x^{\ln x} \, \frac{2 \ln x}{x} \qquad (x&gt;0) \end{align*}</p><p>which is not too bad as a result.

Time to unleash the&nbsp;e<em>xtravaganza</em>! With the base function $x^2+1$ and the exponent function $\sin x$, the power function $\displaystyle (x^2+1)^{\sin x}$ — which is defined&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em> on&nbsp;$\mathbb{R}$&nbsp;— has the added bonus that both the base and the exponent functions are differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ as well. In which case, a single application of the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong>&nbsp;yields:</p><p>\begin{align*} \left( (x^2+1)^{\sin x}\right)’ &amp; = (x^2+1)^{\sin x} \left[ (\sin x)’ \ln (x^2+1) + (x^2+1)’ \frac{\sin x}{x^2+1} \right] \\ &amp; = (x^2+1)^{\sin x} \left[ \cos x \ln (x^2+1) + \frac{2x \sin x}{x^2+1} \right] \end{align*}</p><p>Interesting!

September 3, 2020 | https://www.srid.ca/689c4a39.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.srid.ca/689c4a39.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d like to announce the public beta of <a href="https://www.cerveau.app/">Cerveau</a><sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, a web app for managing plain-text notes from a GitHub repository. Cerveau integrates directly with <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> which supports <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten</a>-style note-taking in Markdown. This very site you are reading is managed by Neuron and edited in Cerveau, and its Git repo is essentially <a href="https://github.com/srid/srid.ca">a directory of Markdown files</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.cerveau.app/"><img src="https://www.srid.ca/static/cerveau.svg"></a></p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I created the open-source <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_one%27s_own_itch">scratch my own itch</a>, wherein I wanted to maintain my notes for a lifetime, without being dependent on proprietory formats or systems. I still wasn’t totally satisfied however, because I did not want to give up on the <em>convenience</em> of managing notes from a web app on my mobile phone. I didn’t want to be tied to a desktop text editor. So, the idea behind Cerveau was born - which began to resolve that dissatifaction without compromising on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html">future-proofness</a>.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>All notes are written in Markdown, and stored in a Git repository. Cerveau directly modifies the contents of the repository using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps">GitHub Apps API</a>, while caching the latest revision of the repository on a PostgreSQL database. This allows me to edit my notes from a web browser (as well as from a mobile phone), while keeping the canonical version always on Git all the while allowing edits from elsewhere such as <a href="https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode#neuron-mode">Emacs</a> (i.e., two-way sync).</p><h2 id="technology-used">Technology used</h2><p>Both the backend and frontend components of Cerveau are written in <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2009703.html">Haskell</a></span></span>. Haskell is my programming language of choice, because it gets a lot of things right (see <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_matters">Why Haskell matters</a>). Software I write in Haskell tends to be reliable; and I can refactor with confidence without being unduly afraid of introducing bugs. This is especially important when dealing with otherwise brittle JavaScript code in frontend code.</p><h3 id="javascript-is-the-new-assembly-language">JavaScript is the new assembly language</h3><p>Cerveau’s frontend too is written in Haskell. Wait, how is that possible? The GHCJS compiler compiles Haskell code to low-level JavaScript for running in the browser. Cerveau uses the <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012405.html">Reflex FRP</a></span></span> library, via the excellent <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012403.html">Obelisk</a></span></span> framework, which takes care of all the plumbing required to produce such full-stack Haskell apps, so that I as a developer can focus on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/31rat9/reflex_practical_functional_reactive_programming/">FRP</a> application logic. FRP, and similar models of UI programming, is simpler to write and extend than callback based code. Anybody who writes Elm<sup><a href="#fn2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup> can attest to that; however unlike Elm or PureScript, GHCJS code can be <em>shared</em> with the backend. This is what enables Cerveau to directly reuse much of the <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> source code, thus enabling neuron’s core features to work directly on the browser–for example, live HTML preview while editing the note.</p><p>The editor widget is based on CodeMirror, via <a href="https://github.com/Atidot/reflex-codemirror">reflex-codemirror</a>.</p><h3 id="real-time-communication-via-websockets">Real-time communication via WebSockets</h3><p>WebSockets, via <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012401.html">Rhyolite</a></span></span>, is used for real-time communication between the backend and the frontend; if you have two windows open, then updating a note from one window will have the other window automatically update its view without an explicit refresh (this works even if you are viewing a different note that has the modified note in its backlinks).</p><h3 id="nix">Nix</h3><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017102.html">Nix</a></span></span> is used for both developent and deployment; the production version in particular is deployed to a <a href="https://m.do.co/c/d19bbb4d33e8">DigitalOcean</a> droplet running <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/c7170724.html">NixOS</a></span></span>. Nix makes reproducible development environments easy and possible. A testament to this is how easy it is to contribute to neuron (see <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>) - as with one command, <code>nix-shell</code>, you get the full development enviornment including Haskell IDE support starting from a pristine system with nothing but Nix installed.</p><h3 id="full-stack-haskell-from-prototype-to-production">Full-Stack Haskell, from Prototype to Production</h3><p>Much of these technology choices were informed by my working with the folks from <a href="https://obsidian.systems/">Obsidian Systems</a>, whose philosophy is captured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJuXDIUMA0">this talk</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/riJuXDIUMA0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    					<div>
    					    
        					<p>The effect of Open Sourced Software on the world is undeniable. From Android and Linux, which are used by literal billions of people, to Wordpress, GIMP, VLC, and Firefox, OSS (Open sourced software) is truly utilized by everyone, in nearly every aspect of their daily lives. This doesn’t even include the millions of open sourced softwares embedded in the web for every day use. Yet, the tech industry is still the most prosperous on earth, with Silicon Valley accounting for a higher GDP output than Finland (roughly $275 billion per year), and all tech stocks accounting for roughly 1/5th of the worlds economic output.&nbsp;</p><p>How is it than an industry that drives the entire planets economy can be based off of something free-to-use, and still be valuable? Simple: Everyone in the industry benefits from the common core of open source tech - They utilize this common base to propel their proprietary technology farther than it could have ever gone without the OSS. The sum of all these parts is greater than the whole. They don’t prosper <i>despite</i> the free software, they prosper <i>because</i> of the free software.&nbsp;</p><p>So, why cant Open Source principles be applied to other industries? Why can’t farming equipment have a common core of open sourced hardware for all farmers in all parts of the world to use? Why cant there be open sourced genetics, where GMO foods are cataloged, modified, and shared by farmers, both with CRISPR and with natural methods? What about building materials and designs? Medicines? Economic data? Camera tech?&nbsp;</p><p>The potential in all industries of what is possible when Open Source principles are applied is staggering. Organizations, both public and private, could have a shared design understanding across entire disciplines, making everyones products work better, sharply increasing both competition and performance for consumers, and in turn increase market saturation and profits for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Specialized companies could still stay specialized. If you offer a particular service that utilized ideas you created, you would have no obligation to share those secrets: Instead, you would have the option to base them on a common footprint of ideas shared by industry leaders, non-profit orgs, and failed businesses that have released their own ideas for the common market to use. Their incentive to do this is two-fold: One - if they are an industry leader - is a way to offload old ideas into the market and build pedigree and reputation among the industry - it shows you are not just a leader, but a supporter, of the industry you participate in. Second - if they are a startup - is to prove your capabilities so that prospective buyers, investors, etc can gauge your prowess on the market. Finally, a failed business might want to offload its ideas that have not sold as a gesture of goodwill - this is something we simply don’t do right now, but there’s no reason we couldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, the benefits of encouraging Open Source principles in new industries is obvious. I predict that if another industry, like farming, decided to adopt this model they would see huge success from its adoption over time. I personally believe that OS principles could become a polestar for economic growth in the future, and would very likely lead to the rapid technological expansion of any given industry once employed. The future quite literally could be now.&nbsp;</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://www.avo.app/blog/announcing-inspector-and-avos-3m-seed-round | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.avo.app/blog/announcing-inspector-and-avos-3m-seed-round">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We started Avo in 2018 because we believe we can change the way organizations use data to make better decisions for their customers. We’ve been blown away by the impact Avo has had on data quality and developer productivity for our customers. From startups to consumer brands like Rappi, Patreon, TripAdvisor, Sotheby’s, and more, it’s been incredible to see our product fundamentally change the way PMs, devs and data scientists collaborate to plan, track and govern their product analytics. Today, we have some exciting news to share about our progress, a new powerful product offering, and where we’re headed next.</p><h3><strong>What is Avo?</strong><br></h3><p>Avo is next-generation analytics governance. We’re changing how product managers, developers, and data scientists plan, track, and govern analytics across organizations. Before Avo, teams were forced to choose between product delivery speed and reliable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>By using Avo, <a href="https://www.avo.app/customers/patreon-case-study">Patreon has reclaimed 9 out of every 10 hours they used to spend implementing or fixing analytics</a>, going from 4 days for every feature release, to 1 hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies have never had to understand their customers better or faster. Consumers choose the product with the best experience and companies can’t afford to stall product decisions while waiting days or weeks for answers from a centralized BI team. In truth, the industry gold standard is to decentralize business intelligence completely, so that every team is autonomous in making data-driven decisions quickly. Spotify is just one example of a company working under this org-structure.&nbsp;</p><p>But data is brittle and bad data leads to incorrect assumptions. With everyone making data-driven decisions, it’s critical to govern data quality, iterate quickly on the product and business, and avoid customer churn.&nbsp;</p><p>We solved this problem ourselves at QuizUp, to ensure engineering and product time wasn’t wasted re-implementing analytics every time we shipped to our 100M users. Avo solves this more permanently as a SaaS platform without diverting precious time from the core product or accruing technical debt. The result is that we’re helping organizations grow by removing friction around analytics governance and implementation.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Introducing Inspector</strong><br></h3><p>The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what’s wrong with your data. Typically, getting that understanding has been a company-wide initiative that takes months or years, and requires buy-in and collaboration from the VP Product, Head of Data, and VP Engineering.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the <a href="https://www.avo.app/inspector">Avo Inspector</a>. Avo Inspector plays into our larger vision of empowering self-serve analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspector processes event streams, parses event shapes (no PII data), visualizes the entire current state of tracking for the company, highlights tracking issues such as type mismatches, missing properties, and volume discrepancies. We built Inspector because we had helped our customers do this manually too many times.&nbsp;</p><p>With Inspector, our customers get instant insight into what is wrong with their analytics, so they can prioritize the most important issues to fix, and start cleaning and future proofing their analytics step-by-step.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we’re getting great early feedback. On-demand delivery unicorn Rappi is just one of the customers using Inspector:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“This year we scaled to meet the demand of 100,000 new customers digitizing their deliveries and curbside pickups. The problem with every new software release was that we’d break analytics. It represented 25% of our Jira tickets.” Says Rappi’s Head of Engineering, Damian Sima, “In our first week with the Avo Inspector, we’re already discovering tracking issues like missing properties and type mismatches. Now we know what to fix and can do that with Avo.”</em></p><p>Here’s how Inspector works:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f4fffd07427330a5584cc9a_EP8HHtAWyyYFT40Q93yVn2-4m1ztt0M79hnPQzq2R72DazHV_JHbrq_tN4CeYZ7Grx_ZcS06XO9pUqVFUGXhxrbFh5S56WakXhTgaQ5PzrV9jcYNCiF4u9kJTssTJ5smUWQyDU4N.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Inspect your current tracking automatically</strong></p><p>Install the Inspector SDK to observe a living summary of current tracking across platforms. Inspector doesn’t gather any user data, only event shapes and volumes.</p><p><strong>Analyze tracking issues instantly</strong></p><p>Inspector dashboard highlights your current event tracking issues, so different stakeholders can discuss and prioritize what to fix.</p><p><strong>Prioritize what matters</strong></p><p>The inspector dashboard gives you and your team the overview you need, to prioritize the tracking changes that will have the biggest impact on cleaning up mission-critical metrics so you can make progress quickly.</p><p><strong>Clean, step-by-step</strong></p><p>Use your complete overview of what needs to be fixed across platforms, to fix top priority issues with clear event and property definitions, implemented with type safe analytics.</p><p><strong>Future proof</strong></p><p>Great product analytics help teams make the best decisions to grow their business. Truly useful metrics for today and beyond are transparent — where everyone knows which events can help answer their questions — and reliable, consistent data, easy to evolve and implement as the product grows.</p><p>If you’re curious about the infrastructure and behind the scenes (as you should be!), <a href="https://www.avo.app/inspector">learn more about Inspector</a>, <a href="mailto:hi@avo.app">reach out</a> or subscribe to our <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/avo">newsletter</a>.</p><h3><strong>Avo is scaling with the help of world-class developer and data tool investors</strong></h3><p>To build on our momentum, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/avo-raises-3m-for-its-analytics-governance-platform/">we’ve raised $3M</a> from GGV Capital with participation from Heavybit, Y Combinator and others, to make Avo a game changer for democratizing analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d like to use this opportunity to thank all the incredible people who have believed in our team and our mission, and supported us throughout this journey. A special shoutout to Hjalli and Investa, Gustaf, Jared, Aaron, Kevin, Kat, Michael and all the YC folks, Joe, Tom, Dana, Jesse and James at Heavybit, Glenn, Oren, Tai and the entire crew at GGV, the Brunnur team, Jenny and co at Crowberry, Pete at Optimizely, Coby at Radar, Sandy, Ari and more. In addition to our investors, we’re surrounded with smart and generous people who have hosted us on their couches in San Francisco, helped us hire, advised us on Avo, introduced us to great people, et cetera; thank you to Spencer, June, Gunni, Jói, Aliya, Drew, Kiddi, Siggi, Hilmar, Arndís, Andrés, Kjartan, Paul, Gummi, Vala, Austin, Brian &amp; Michael, Leslie, Shuo, Alex, Ron and so many more.</p><p>Sölvi and I are proud to have been joined by an <a href="https://www.avo.app/about">outstanding team</a> of exceptionally kind, talented, and driven humans on this mission, who we are honored to be working with every day.</p><p>Our focus in the coming months will be helping more organizations uplevel their analytics governance fast, so they can join the global shift to self-serve analytics culture. We will also continue to focus on developer experience and seamless collaboration between product managers, developers and data scientists – because we don’t want teams to have to choose between product delivery speed and reliable analytics anymore.</p><p>‍</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://www.avo.app/jobs">We're hiring! </a>Come work with us in our remote-first culture (since way before COVID 😅) and diverse and inclusive team 💛</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><article><div><div><p><img src="https://www.pachyderm.com/images/blog-images/hub-ga-announcement-hero.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Today we’re announcing the production ready availability of <a href="https://hub.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm Hub</a>, our powerful end-to-end machine learning and data lineage platform in the cloud. Hub delivers all the key features of the <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a> suite but in a completely managed cloud-native environment. You no longer need to have Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure expertise in-house, Pachyderm Hub let’s you seamlessly spin up a cluster in minutes.</p><p>While Pachyderm always delivered the power teams needed to do data science at scale, you also needed a strong systems administration and architecture team to get Kubernetes and containers into production. Kuberenetes is way more than just software you download and install. It needs monitoring and management, backup, redundancy, capacity and upgrade planning, to name just a few. That represents a real challenge for some organizations. Now, we’ve removed the barriers to entry, which makes it possible for smaller teams to start doing data science faster.</p><p>Pachyderm Hub includes all of the features that were challenging for teams to set up, like autoscaling with GPUs, security and isolation, backup, and automation. Now you can rely on Pachyderm’s trained team of Kubernetes experts to handle the infrastructure for you and concentrate on data science instead of systems administration. Kubernetes is powerful, but the real power comes from the applications you can run on it.</p><blockquote><h4 id="you-simply-bring-your-code-and-data-pachyderm-hub-handles-all-the-infrastructure">You simply bring your code and data, Pachyderm Hub handles all the infrastructure.</h4></blockquote><p>More than anything, Pachyderm Hub delivers on our ultimate vision for a fully collaborative, shareable, and reproducible data science platform. It does what Git did for data, bringing powerful version control and collaboration to your AI applications development. Pachyderm Hub makes team collaboration and sharing data, code, and infra totally seamless. Team members can create and share workspaces, invite other team members to collaborate, and behind the scenes the platform scales transparently as you add workloads.</p><p>Since our launch 2014, Pachyderm’s data science platform has quickly become a foundation for the <a href="http://ai-infrastructure.org/">emerging Canonical Stack (CS) in machine learning</a>. Because other platforms only let you track metadata, they lack the true iron-clad immutability of a robust version controlled file system. If your data can change after you’ve recorded your metadata then you can’t reproduce critical data science results. Our customers understand the need for true data lineage and data versioning. That’s why over the past year, Pachyderm has attracted tremendous new enterprise customers like Shell, LogMeIn, Battelle Ecology, and AgBiome, as well as multiple government agencies, pharmaceutical and bioinformatics companies, two major North American banks, and other Fortune 500 powerhouses.</p><p>Beyond data versioning, customers choose Pachyderm because they need a clean, simple and elegant data science pipeline system that delivers data science at scale. The Pachyderm platform allows teams to bring any framework, language or library and fit them together into a smooth, automated workflow with ease. If it can run in a Docker container it can run on Pachyderm.Customers aren’t locked into one tool like Spark, R or Python, or one machine learning framework, like Pytorch or Tensorflow. They can use it all on one complete system.</p><blockquote><h4 id="launch-your-free-workspace-todayhttpshubpachydermcom"><a href="https://hub.pachyderm.com/">Launch your free workspace today!</a></h4></blockquote><p>If you’re ready to do production workloads you can easily upgrade to benefit from GPUs and enterprise team collaboration, just <strong><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/request-a-demo/">talk with one of our experts</a></strong>, or join our <strong><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/slack/">open source community on Slack</a></strong> and check out the Pachyderm codebase on <strong><a href="https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm">Github</a></strong>.</p></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>When you learn a language, you think of words in it differently than how you think about words in your native tongue. I like the word “deflect.” I don’t know why, but it just has a nice ring to it. I like it so much that I worked on a (shuttered) developer-tool SaaS by that name some years ago. Do you know who else likes deflection? You, most likely.</p>



<blockquote><p>“No matter what I say, they keep doing the same things.”</p><p>“They don’t care about the product, only working on interesting tech.”</p><p>“Product keep defining work wrong.”</p><p>“The CEO wouldn’t allow it.”</p><p>“The team simply doesn’t have a high-bar culture.”</p></blockquote>



<p>How long has it been since you’ve said something along those lines, out loud or to yourself? Even the best executives I work with do this deflection by reflex from time to time. It’s leadership aikido.</p>



<h3>It might be true</h3>



<p>I can almost hear you mutter to yourself, “wait a minute! Those are all true!” I agree. The team might genuinely not care about the product right now. Perhaps the culture is out of whack when it comes to craftsmanship and quality. </p>



<p>That’s the only reason that deflection works as a coping and defense mechanism. If you’d simply say something that was clearly false, someone would call you out on it. You have a correct observation, at least subjectively. The issue is that you are abducting your responsibility for it.</p>



<h3>Total Ownership</h3>



<p>The most successful executives I work with are those who internalize that the vast majority of limits are self-imposed. If you deflect and put the blame on someone else, you teach yourself to be helpless. With time, you genuinely come to believe that you are powerless, as detailed in the (excellent) book Learned Optimism.</p>



<p>Reconsider the deflections above and think about what your role is in making those statements true. Why would the CEO allow something if you failed to make an articulated argument? This team you’re talking about, who hired it? Who has been managing and leading it?</p>



<p>Is everything entirely up to you? Of course not. A lot <em>is</em>, though. If you take ownership of the matter and decide to act, you will find ways to move forward in most cases. Do you know how just being told there’s a solution makes you find it? See a chessboard with the question “what would you do now,” and you might feel at a loss. Instead, if the prompt was “find the mate in two,” you are significantly more likely to find it. I once spent 90 minutes in an exam trying to prove P=NP because the instructor made an error writing the exam. I was told the given problem had a polynomial solution, and I gave it a damn good try.</p>



<p>Address your work problems with the same mindset. Take complete ownership. If you still come up empty, consider <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/">getting some help</a>. But don’t just deflect.</p>

<p>We started building ghcide over 2 years ago as part of our efforts at Digital Asset to provide a great IDE experience to all <a href="https://daml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML</a> users. As a lot of people in the Haskell community know, the DAML compiler is based on a modified version of GHC, so naturally the people working on it were Haskell programmers. As ghcide got better and better, and we got to experience it whenever we were working on DAML codebases, we started missing the same features from our Haskell development. Over time, we started abstracting over DAML-specifics and eventually managed to get it working on some hand-crafted Haskell projects, but couldn’t integrate with Cabal, Stack or other build tools. Around that time, we also open sourced the whole <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML codebase</a> which included ghcide – but we didn’t announce ghcide anywhere. Luckily, at this time Matthew Pickering released <a href="https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hie-bios</a> which made it trivial to integrate ghcide with all of the various build tools in the Haskell system while still using the same codebase as the basis for the DAML IDE.</p>



<p>External interest in ghcide was very limited until Neil gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cijsaeWNf2E&amp;list=PLxxF72uPfQVRdAsvj7THoys-nVj-oc4Ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keynote at MuniHac 2019</a>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Interest and external contributions skyrocketed over a few days and we split ghcide into a separate repository to make it easier for contributors and users that no longer had to deal with the DAML monorepo. Since then, there have been a huge number of contributions to ghcide that not only benefited Haskell users, but also DAML users. It is impossible to name all the amazing features that have been contributed to ghcide, but some of our favourites include:</p>



<ul><li>Support for code completions</li><li>Many significant performance improvements</li><li>Multi-component support</li><li>A wide variety of code actions</li></ul>



<p>In January 2020, a lot of ghcide contributors and contributors from <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-ide-engine</a> got together and agreed to unify their efforts as part of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-language-server</a> – which builds on top of ghcide while carrying over all the features and plugins that came from haskell-ide-engine. Half a year later, it’s not a stretch to say that this endeavour has been an enormous success and enthusiastic statements from users can attest to this. Finally, most efforts on Haskell tooling are focused on a single approach and everyone can benefit from improvements.</p>



<p>As the importance of ghcide to Haskell tooling has grown, keeping such an important repository in the Digital Asset organisation with only Digital Asset employees as maintainers has started to hold back the flood of contributions. Therefore, in consultation with many of the contributors, Digital Asset has made the decision to turn ghcide into a proper community project under the <a href="https://github.com/haskell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell</a> github organization. In making this transition, ghcide gains a much wider team of maintainers, sourced from the current active ghcide contributors. The DAML IDE will switch to an open source fork of ghcide and cherry-pick changes from upstream as needed and we will continue to upstream bugfixes and improvements into ghcide.</p>



<p>We are very excited to see in which directions ghcide will grow in the future. Thanks to all ghcide contributors and in particular to Pepe Iborra, Matthew Pickering, Alan Zimmermann, wz1000, Luke Lau, Alejandro Serrano, fendor and Jacek Generowicz. We’ve enjoyed being part of the Haskell IDE tooling community, and look forward to working with both current and new contributors in the future.</p>

</svg><span>SzFE students blockade the entrance to the university.</span><span>Fotó: Kremmer Sarolta</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following a demonstration on Monday, around 250 students occupied the university's Budapest campus, saying they would not allow any members of the new leadership to enter the building. The students' <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/a-vidnyanszky-fele-kuratorium-lemondasat-kovetelik-az-egyetemet-elfoglalo-diakok" target="_blank">list of demands</a> includes:<br></p><ul>
<li>guaranteed autonomy for the university</li>
<li>the revocation of the law which alters their university's management model</li>
<li>the resignation of the new board of directors</li>
<li>reinstatement of powers to the democratically elected senate&nbsp;</li>
<li>rejection of the new method of appointing university leaders and board members</li>
<li>continued state funding of the university</li>
<li>that the administrative rights over the university not be transferred to the foundation.</li>
</ul><p>At a press conference in front of the building on Tuesday, a delegation of students said they would only allow current staff and students to enter the building until further notice. According to an <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/felmeres-az-szfe-hallgatoinak-100-szazaleka-elutasitja-ahogy-az-egyetem-vidnyanszkyek-kezebe-kerult" target="_blank">internal poll</a> taken by the university's Students' Union (HÖK), 100 percent of student respondents rejected the restructuring, and nearly 70 percent believe&nbsp;its true aim is the "long-term, ideological and political occupation of the institution.”</p><p>As a result of the restructuring, key decision-making powers will be exercised by the board of directors of the foundation, including adoption of operational regulations, budgetary decisions and development plans, as well as the selection of the rector and the appointment of department heads. Members of the new board of directors include two executives of the state-owned energy company MOL. The chairman of the board is Attila Vidnyánszky,&nbsp;<a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/29/itt-a-vege-vidnyanszkyek-kezi-vezerlessel-iranyithatjak-az-szfe-t" target="_blank">a former director of the Hungarian National Theatre</a> who has routinely made <a href="https://szfe.hu/hirek/egyetlen-kerdes/" target="_blank">derisive comments</a> about SzFE and its faculty, and is considered to be a close ally of the ruling Fidesz party.&nbsp;</p><p>
As we reported in&nbsp;<a href="https://insighthungary.444.hu/2020/06/25/fearing-for-its-autonomy-university-holds-protest-against-privatization-plan" target="_blank">June</a>, university leaders and students have argued that the transfer of ownership of the 155-year-old state-run university to a private foundation is an&nbsp;attempt to place it under political control and centrally dictate its operations and cultural output. Some observers also&nbsp;<a href="https://444.hu/2020/06/24/kevesebb-raforditassal-nagyobb-kontroll-errol-szol-az-egyetemek-alapitvanyi-kiszervezese" target="_blank">predict that the quasi-privatization of SzFE and other Hungarian universities will result in further state divestment from higher education</a>&nbsp;while reducing the universities' autonomy.</p><h2>Citizens of V4 countries may enter Hungary despite border closures</h2><p>Citizens of three central European countries will be <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/a-csehek-mellett-a-lengyelek-es-a-szlovakok-is-belephetnek-magyarorszagra" target="_blank">granted exceptional permission to enter Hungary</a> following coronavirus-related border closures that took effect on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced on Monday.</p><p>
Czech, Slovak and Polish citizens that booked accommodations in Hungary before September 1 will be allowed to enter the country if they present a negative coronavirus test no more than five days old.&nbsp;The border closure, which <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/28/gulyas-szigorubb-intezkedesek-jonnek-szeptember-elejetol" target="_blank">banned entry to nearly all foreign citizens</a> after a steep rise in new coronavirus cases in Hungary, will remain in effect for citizens of all other countries.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--KTfLMUSI--/7Uxbrk3zBL6n1Dqqys.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

On Monday, the exception was extended to all citizens of V4 countries.<br></p><p>Critics of the decision argued that entering Hungary is now easier for foreign citizens of the V4 than for Hungarian citizens returning from abroad: upon arrival, Hungarians must submit to a 14-day quarantine period which can only be abridged by two negative PCR tests conducted in Hungary at their own expense. (Orbán's chief of staff earlier said that the government does not consider tests conducted abroad to be reliable.) The exception allows V4 citizens to enter with only one test, conducted in their own countries, and does not require quarantine. Similar exceptions were made for <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/egy-kulfoldi-sportolonak-sokkal-egyszerubb-bejutnia-a-frissen-lezart-magyarorszagra-mint-egy-magyar-allampolgarnak" target="_blank">foreign participants in Hungarian sporting events</a>.</p><p>On Monday, two members of the European Commission <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/unios-biztosok-levelet-irtak-a-magyar-kormanynak-a-visegradi-orszagokkal-valo-kivetelezes-miatt" target="_blank">wrote a letter to Hungary</a>,&nbsp;arguing the exceptions for V4 citizens threatened "the integrity of the Schengen area and of applying border measures in a non-discriminatory way to all EU citizens and residents."</p><p>The government defended the border closures by saying that introduction of the coronavirus from abroad represents the greatest epidemiological risk. However, a pandemic advisor to the government said in an interview Monday that <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/nagyon-veszelyes-jarvanyugyi-helyzetre-figyelmeztet-a-kormanynak-szakerto-matematikus-professzor" target="_blank">less than 10 percent of new virus cases in Hungary can be attributed to foreign travel</a>.</p><p><a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/a-jarvany-szempontjabol-erthetetlen-miert-kivetelezunk-a-visegradi-orszagokkal-a-hatarokon" target="_blank">Recent statistics from the V4 countries</a> raise questions over Hungary's decision to grant travel exemptions to their citizens: daily new coronavirus cases in Czechia, Slovakia and Poland have risen dramatically in recent days with Poland registering six times more daily cases than Hungary. At the end of August, each of the three countries had an exponentially higher rate of cases per million people when compared to Hungary.</p><h2>Free press organizations call on EU to take action against Hungary's use of funds to undermine media freedom</h2><p>A group of 16 press freedom organizations has <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/02/ujsagiro-es-jogvedo-szervezetek-szolitjak-fel-az-uniot-lepjen-fel-a-magyar-mediapiac-allami-torzitasaval-szemben" target="_blank">called on the European Union to take action against Hungary</a> for alleged violations of EU state aid rules to undermine media pluralism.</p><p>In a <a href="https://ipi.media/eu-must-act-on-hungary-media-market-distortion/" target="_blank">letter to&nbsp;EU Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager</a>, the organizations wrote that&nbsp;the Hungarian government "has pursued a strategy of deliberately manipulating the media market, bending rules designed to prevent free and fair competition and weaponizing state resources to punish critical media and reward government mouthpieces".</p><p>The letter cites two state aid complaints, filed with the European Commission in 2016 and 2018, that concern Hungarian media freedom. The first involved Hungary's public broadcaster "showing deliberate and clear bias in favour of the Fidesz party," while the second presented "extensive evidence around the government’s market-distorting practices" in distributing state advertising in media outlets.&nbsp;The letter claims that the distribution of such advertising "follows no market logic" and is "almost exclusively geared toward propping up pro-government media".</p><p>"We are seriously concerned that the Commission’s failure thus far to respond to these complaints perpetuates the Hungarian government’s market-distorting practices and allows for the further decimation of independent media in the country," the letter reads. "The <a href="https://insighthungary.444.hu/2020/07/23/resignations-begin-at-index-after-firing-of-editor-in-chief-protest-for-press-freedom-planned" target="_blank">turmoil at Index.hu</a> shows clearly that the situation will continue to worsen. The Hungarian public’s access to sources of balanced news and information is in greater danger than ever before."</p><h2>Public employees go on three-day strike as government refuses negotiations</h2><ul>
<li>Increased pay grades</li>
<li>the reimbursement of local governments for pandemic defense expenses</li>
<li>financial support for protecting the jobs of public employees</li>
<li>the repeal of government decisions to appropriate automobile taxes and suspend tourist taxes, and</li>
<li>the abolition of the "solidarity tax" demanded from local governments.</li>
</ul><p>Striking public employees made these demands of the government as they <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/02/hiaba-sztrajkolnak-a-kormany-nem-targyal-az-onkormanyzati-dolgozok-erdekkeviseletevel" target="_blank">staged a three-day strike</a> beginning on Wednesday. According to the Union of Public Officials, Civil Servants and Public Workers (MKKSZ), 5,358 local government employees across Hungary are taking part in the strike, representing some 17 percent of the sector. Most strikers are not staging total work stoppages, with many engaging in two-hour "warning strikes", the union said.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--mnltoODe--/7HRfzFU6dPJK1Jgqks.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

This could lead to mass dismissals of public employees, it said.<br></p><p>According to MKKSZ president Mrs. Péter Boros, Interior Minister Sándor Pintér informed the union in a letter that the government would not negotiate with the public workers, arguing local governments had received adequate support from the state.&nbsp;</p><p>"A pandemic is not the time to pull apart and inflame tensions," Pintér wrote.</p><h2>For regular English language updates, sign up for the free InsightHungary newsletter here:</h2>

<p><em>Lately, I have been talking a lot about Crystal - probably too much if you ask my coworkers at Kalvad. So let me explain once and for all why Crystal is such an amazing language and how it will quickly grow in popularity.</em></p><p>Since I started to write code, I have always been looking for the perfect programming language. A language combining clarity, easy of use and performances. Nothing more, but nothing less either. In this quest of perfection, I've being playing with a lot of languages, but I always had some complains with the most famous ones: JavaScript is over-permissive, Python is great, but as all scripted language (Ruby, PHP, ...) they lack of performances. C/C++ or even Rust works well, but at the cost of ease of use and readability. Golang brought some fresh air into Software industry but its package system is terrible. <br>At this point, you might have noticed that I am really picky person. Which emphasize how amazing Crystal is.<br></p><h2 id="crystal-in-a-few-lines">Crystal in a few lines</h2><p>If you check out the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">website</a>, you will quickly grasp the main concepts of Crystal:</p><ul><li>compiled: better performances &amp; limit errors at run time</li><li>statically type checked: means you can omit types but they are still here and the code won't compile if a type is ambiguous. It increase code readability and limit error at run time.</li><li>types are non-nullable by default: crystal said NO to the famous billion dollar mistake</li><li>green concurrency: just like channels in go, Crystal allows to easily run async tasks and share data without using shared memory and locks</li><li>ruby-like syntax: reading crystal is like reading a book. Really</li><li>shards: one of the best package system ever built</li><li>an amazing standard library</li><li>... and lot of other cool things: C binding, macros, native unit test, native template system, everything is an object, etc.</li></ul><h2 id="crystal-in-depth">Crystal in depth</h2><p>Code is worth a thousand of words.</p><h3 id="syntax-and-readability">Syntax and readability</h3><p>Crystal has a Ruby-like syntax, but it also add some cool feature to improve code organization such as modules.</p><pre><code>module Controllers # use module to scope your code

  class ApiResult
    property http_code : Int16
    property message : String
    property data : Json::Any
    
    # our class constructor
    def initialize(@http_code, @message, @data)
    	# automatically set the properties based on the variables names
    end
  end

  class UserController &lt; Controller
    # create a login method which return an 'ApiResult' object
    def login : ApiResult
    
      # '!' by convention means that this function raises an exception in case of failure
      params.validate!

      # '?' means that the function will return 'nil' in case of failure
      user = Models::User.find_by_email? params["email"]
      
      # clear one-liner, '?' here means the function returns a boolean
      return ApiResult.new(404, "user not found", nil) if user.nil?
      
      # last value of a function is automatically returned
      ApiResult.new 200, "ok", {
        token: Services::JWT.encode(user.id.as(String)),
        user: user
      }.to_json
      
    rescue
      # You can add a 'rescue' for the whole funtion. How convenient is that
      ApiResult.new 500, "Oops. Something happened!", nil
    ensure
      # And finally you can use 'ensure' to always run a piece of code
      Services::Log.action "new login"
    end
  end
end</code></pre><h3 id="types">Types<br></h3><p>Types in Crystal are very powerful. Crystal is a strictly typed language but thanks to type inference, the compiler will be able to assign types by himself. Therefore, unless the type of a variable is ambiguous for the compiler, you can omit to write it down.</p><p>On top of that, types are non nullable by default but can be set as nullable by adding a '?' at the end of the type declaration. Let see some code.</p><pre><code># return 'hello' if @input is an Int32 or a null value if @input is a boolean
def hello_world(input : Bool|Int32) : String? # since this function can return a null value, we need to set the return value as a nullable string using '?'
  typeof(input) == Int32 ? "hello" : nil
end

def main
  puts hello_world(true) # =&gt; "[nil]"
  hello_world(1) # =&gt; "hello" 
end</code></pre><h3 id="everything-is-object">Everything is object</h3><p>And you can extend everything ! The code below parse a YAML file and push the content into an array.</p><pre><code>class Array(T)
  # Extend the Array class to add a new class method
  def self.from_envcr_yaml_file(file_path : String)
    # Simply read a YML file from a pathname and parse it into an array of EnvItem defined below
    File.open(file_path) { |f| Array(T).from_yaml(f) }
  end
end

module Envcr

  class EnvItem
    YAML.mapping(
      name: String,
      optional: {type: Bool, default: false},
      default: String?,
    )
    def eval
      # do whatever you need here with the values
    end
  end

  def load!(file_path : String)
    # Use the newly created 'from_envcr_yaml_file' function method to build an array of EnvItem from a YML file
    Array(EnvItem).from_envcr_yaml_file(file_path).each { |x| x.eval }
    #...
  end

  # ...

end</code></pre><h3 id="standard-library">Standard Library</h3><p>The Crystal standard library offers a lot of amazing features. As a direct result, the different libraries and frameworks will rely on the same core components. And you know what is cool about that? You will always get back on your feet even with when learning a different library/frameworks.</p><p>See, below are 2 piece of code from 2 different projects using 2 different frameworks. However, notice how both simply expose the standard <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.34.0/HTTP/Request.html" rel="nofollow">HTTP request object</a><br></p><pre><code># Middleware inside a Kemal project
class AuthMiddleware &lt; Kemal::Handler
    def call(context)
        return call_next context if context.request.headers.has_key?("Authorization") == false
            || context.request.headers["Authorization"] == ""
        user_id = Services::JWT.decode(context.request.headers["Authorization"].split(' ')[1])
        # ...
    end
    # ...
end</code></pre><pre><code># Middleware inside an Amber project
  class Auth &lt; Amber::Pipe::Base
    def call(context)
        return unauthorized context unless context.request.headers.has_key?("Authorization")
            &amp;&amp; context.request.headers["Authorization"] != ""
        parse_jwt context, context.request.headers["Authorization"]
        # ...
    end
    # ...
end</code></pre><h3 id="shards">Shards</h3><p>Shard is the package system of Crystal. And it's one of the best out there. You can simply create a new crystal project using <code>crystal init</code> :</p><p> - <code>crystal init app cool_stuff</code> will generate a new binary application<br> - <code>crystal init lib cool_stuff</code> will generate a new library</p><p>In both case, the folder created will look like that:</p><pre><code>├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── shard.yml
├── spec
│   ├── cool_stuff.cr
│   └── spec_helper.cr
└── src
    └── cool_stuff.cr</code></pre><p>Congratulations, you just created a new Crystal shard. You can then edit 'shard.yml' to add dependencies, edit the author or add a description, and once you are done, you can simply push your project on github (on https://github.com/dlacreme/cool_stuff for example).</p><p>And once your project is available on github, you can import it on any other Crystal application:</p><pre><code># shard.yml
dependencies:
  cool_stuff:
    github: dlacreme/cool_stuff
    branch: master</code></pre><h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-crystal">What can you do with Crystal?</h2><p>Crystal can be used for pretty much everything. However, I believe it has 2 domains in which it performs better:</p><ul><li>low-level programming. Thanks to its awesome standard library, you can pretty much do everything out of box in a few lines of code. In case the standard library does not have what you need, you can simply embed some C code</li><li>back-end system. Born during the web era, back-end developers quickly built strong web frameworks in Crystal</li></ul><h2 id="current-status-future-of-crystal">Current status &amp; Future of Crystal</h2><p>Crystal is still in beta. Currently running v0.35, it's actually the last version before the first stable release (v1) which is expected before 2021. However, we will still needs a few years to build the whole ecosystem around it. We have some strong frameworks and libraries already, but they all still need to reach their own v1.</p><p>Also, it's important to note Crystal is still not fully running on Windows. It is actually a requirement for the v1 of Crystal and this is one of the main focus of the core team. Hopefully, this won't be an issue for long.</p><h2 id="why-crystal-will-slowly-climb-to-the-top">Why Crystal will slowly climb to the top &nbsp;</h2><p>To end this post, and now you have a better overview of what Crystal can do, let me explain why I think Crystal will become one of the major programming languages:</p><ul><li>readability and access: Crystal is very easy to learn and it's even easier if you have some experience with Ruby. Crystal can easily be used by a wide range of developers.</li><li>performances: Crystal is fast. Very fast. And fast is always better</li><li>release error-less product: thanks to unit tests, strict types and non-nilable types, you can only build stronger products</li><li>fast development: with its awesome package manager &amp; extended standard library, you can focus on the core of your product</li><li>web friendly: Crystal natively provides everything you need to build a web application (native template system, great HTTP standard library). It will slowly slide into every tech-stack</li></ul><p>In short, Crystal is the best and I hope to see you soon into the Crystal community !</p><p>... and I am done for today.</p><blockquote>Have fun coding and talk to you soon !</blockquote>

September 3, 2020 | https://helecloud.com/blog/recovering-failure-in-aws-on-a-tuesday-morning/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://helecloud.com/blog/recovering-failure-in-aws-on-a-tuesday-morning/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By Will Hall</em></p><p>As I am sure many of you know, AWS had an Availability Zone failure within the EU-West-2 (London) region on Tuesday 25th August. But how, where and what do you do when you are a managed services company trying to ensure appropriate availability for your customers across AWS?</p><p>Tuesdays, in August, in the UK, are often punctuated by the drinking of tea, not large failures to happen in AWS. Realistically, datacentre major events are not particularly common, and major outages are even less common, largely due to either extreme natural phenomenon or scaled configuration errors (where the latter is far more likely).</p><h2>All was not OK in EU-West-2</h2><p>From a HeleCloud perspective, the first thing to alert us to the issues was the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) we run for one of our customers informed us that there was degraded performance across an ElasticSearch cluster. Whilst these events are not regular, they are also not unheard of. That said, in such cases we move between infrastructure, releasing instances from the failing piece of infrastructure and quickly rebuild within a new location without any performance degradation. However, this event was not the same as we were having issues communicating via the API. The AWS API is the core connection between the outside world requesting resources and infrastructure and the datacentre.</p><p>Upon seeing these alerts, we immediately opened a request with AWS Support highlighting the challenge and set about trying to understand the scope and complexity of the issue. When referencing back, we were aware of the issue around 02:16 PT, which was around 10 minutes after AWS had become aware of the issue (addressed in later status updates).</p><h2>Diagnosing the issue</h2><p>One of the great advantages of us running Managed Services for many clients is that not only do we have experience of a great range of different challenges but we also have a range of different estates that are simultaneously running infrastructure across the whole of AWS, so you can compare across different accounts, Regions and Availability Zones to discover outages more quickly.</p><p>Whilst the Managed Services team were keeping our customers informed on the potential issues, we were also reaching out across the company to build a consensus about what the issue was and how we could aim to mitigate it. By using our knowledge across the AWS estate, we could see that the problem was focussed on EC2 and RDS instances and further investigation showed us that it was within the euw2-az2 availability zone (also called eu-west2b).</p><p>A good secondary check is always to check various places on the Web to see if others are complaining about outages also. Reddit and Twitter are usually quite fast in these kinds of outage situations. This is just to support the results of our investigation and for us is just another data point that we like to keep an eye on.</p><h2>Beginning to Resolve the Issues</h2><p>Now that we had diagnosed the issue as being EC2 and RDS in euw2-az2, we started mitigation efforts to resolve our issues. With the root cause being both within connectivity and performance of the infrastructure in that Availability Zone, it was not simply a question of restarting the instances, which should move to working hardware. As you are probably aware, running in multiple Availability Zones is part of AWS architectural planning and normally you would plan to run instances in more than 1 Availability Zone for exactly this kind of situation, however, the first thing to do was identify all of the failing underlying infrastructure to start to mitigate the problem. The process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Identify anything running only in euw2-az2 (that is going to be failing now)</li><li>Identify anything running partly in euw2-az2 (that is going to be underperforming)</li><li>Migrate or move anything that can be moved to other availability zones where possible.</li></ol><p>For services such as RDS, the challenge was within database servers that were only located in a single AZ as multi-AZ databases were already mitigating the issue to a different availability zone. Having effective infrastructure as code meant that we were able to move the majority of these services, within a short window and architecturally there were very few single AZ databases. In general, we avoid running RDS instances in production environments in a single Availability Zone for exactly this reason.</p><h2>Minimal Disruption Migration</h2><p>As with any kind of issue resolution, the aim is to provide minimal disruption to end services whilst resolving the problem, for instances that were already within euw2-az2 they already had severe degradation and therefore it was critical to be able to move them from that availability zone to another to recover applications and services.</p><p>We began looking to move services out of the Availability Zone within the first hour of the issue and ran team-wide discussions on how to best resolve with minimal disruption. We mention minimal disruption as with being a managed services and professional services company it is important to run our customer workloads with the utmost of care. However, within the first 2 hours of disruption, we were able to resolve, mitigate and address 80% of the issues within the AZ.</p><div><figure><img src="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-1019x1024.png" alt="" width="815" height="819" srcset="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-980x985.png 980w, https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-480x482.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20815%20819'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-980x985.png 980w, https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-480x482.png 480w" data-lazy-src="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-1019x1024.png"></figure></div><h2>What We Learnt from the Outage</h2><p>There are a few learnings to come from the recovery of euw2-az2. Firstly, it does matter that you architect your solutions to be multi-availability zone (multi-AZ). There is a big difference between being multi-region (EU-west-1, EU-west-2, EU-central-1) and multi-availability zone and for the majority of production services, <strong>we would not recommend anything that does not run across multiple availability zones.</strong></p><p>Secondly, there is no replacement for knowledge and experience. Having a team of our best people working and probing to try and find the limits and extent of the issue was vital in us both understanding and mitigating the problem quickly. I would suggest that when this situation arises again, get together with other clever people (whether that be internally on Slack/Teams or externally on Twitter) and try to find solutions.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Conversations around window managers can be a little contentious…but for some of us, it makes very little difference. I'm one of those humans. As much as I adore nerding out around some ultra-minimal window manager that requires you change settings by compiling its c code, at the end of the day I gain little benefit from any specific approach.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AK2UKUfsV3g" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>That said, I do love and prefer Linux. The fact that we're afforded these choices around window managers is what draws many of us in initially. Your computer, whether running Ubuntu or Arch, can flip a switch to run a very capable, heavy-weight manager such as <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> or a manager with a binary size of ~1mb, such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>. Before diving too deep into my day-to-day workflow, let's set some primer around window managers.</p><h2 id="window-managers">Window Managers</h2><p>Window managers come in two, primary, varieties. These include stacked and tiled. Tiled are commonly composed of several “workspaces”, which can be switched through and host one or many windows, tiled side-by-side. They (typically, by default) do not allow windows to stack or overlap. The following screenshot, from Wikipedia, demonstrates this for i3.</p><p><img src="https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why-i-dont-care-about-my-window-manager/i3.png" alt=""></p><p>Stacked window managers, on the other hand, are what we conventionally think of. Especially those of us that have a history with OSX (mac) or Windows. These window managers give us floating windows that can overlap and be moved into any format on our screens. The following screenshot, from Wikipedia, demonstrates this for xfce.</p><p><img src="https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why-i-dont-care-about-my-window-manager/xfce.png" alt=""></p><p>From my experience, many have associated the move to tiling managers as a more hardcore approach to interacting with Linux. Or at least one we associate with focus, minimalism, and/or getting things done. Over the years, some using i3 and others using dwm, I have found my productivity remain relatively static. I did have some super cool layouts that I loved looking at. However, I am a habitual over-optimizer. This trait sends me down constant rabbit holes of thinking through what workspace I should assign to which tasks, how I should be setting up a tiling layout for optimal focus, and many more considerations. Eventually I realized this constant customization was causing me more loss in focus than the gain I'd hoped to have leaving stacked managers behind.</p><p>In short, this was a me problem, not a tiling window manager problem. Knowing myself better now, I have switched back to stacked managers, with optimizations and automation focused around my key priorities.</p><h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2><p>My priorities around workflow are fairly straight forward. Given I have the attention span of a small squirrel, my key priorities are:</p><ol><li>Switch between key applications quickly</li><li>Switch between key applications with minimal context-switching</li></ol><p>So switching between applications, this isn't too hard in any window manager, is it? Sure, it is not. However minimizing the thought required to jump from a to b is huge for my work. For example, at the most intense end of the spectrum, clicking around and moving windows to find firefox is less than ideal. Even using flows like alt+tab or a launcher requires me to think about where the thing is or how to find/focus it. Additionally, the applications I care about and need to switch between are fairly minimal in quantity. There are maybe 7 total with 4 key ones I constantly toggle. These are:</p><ul><li>Web Browser (firefox)</li><li>Terminal (st)</li><li>IDE (intellij)</li><li>File browser (nemo)</li></ul><p>For me, the question is, with a key or two, can I bring up the application I need to get the task done no matter where it preexisted. Additionally, if the app isn't running, can I transparently launch it without being concerned about another shortcut or workflow? This is where my most important trick comes in, a script named <code>lof</code> (launch or focus).</p><h2 id="launch-or-focus-lof">Launch or Focus (lof)</h2><p><code>lof</code> is a simple script that does exactly what the name implies. If the app isn't running, it launches it. If the app is, it focuses it. <code>lof</code> is not a unique solution. For example there is <a href="https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp">jumpapp</a>, which is a far more capable tool than <code>lof</code>. I have chosen to write <code>lof</code> because it is less than 20 lines of shell script (when comments are removed), easy to understand, and handles 97% of my use cases.</p><p><code>lof</code> can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop/blob/master/s/lof">octetz/linux-desktop repository</a>. I have <a href="https://octetz.com/docs/2020/2020-02-23-linux-desktop-configuration/">another blog</a> post on how I use this repo, if you're interested. At the time of this writing, the script looks something like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span># lof: launch or focus</span>
<span># this script checks whether an app is running and</span>
<span># if running, focuses the window</span>
<span># if not running, launches the app</span>

<span># this script is likely called from another command or script</span>

<span># usage: lof [arg]</span>
<span># [arg]: provide the full path, arguments, and flags representing the process</span>
<span># The value of arg will be looked up literally in the process list by wrapping [arg] in ^ (start) and $ (end)</span>
<span># for example, to ensure the correct firefox window is launched, lof would be used as follows:</span>
<span># lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox</span>

<span># for web-based apps, nodejs-natifier can be used to generate a desktop binary</span>
<span># https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-nativefier</span>

<span># this script assumes the app exists and wmctrl is installed</span>
<span># checks do not occur to ensure optimal performance</span>

APP_NAME<span>=</span><span>"</span>$1<span>"</span>

<span># find pid for app process</span>
<span># -f includes the entire process details, including arguments and flags</span>
APP_PID<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>pgrep -f <span>"</span><span>^</span><span>${</span>APP_NAME<span>}</span>$<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

<span># if app is not running, start it</span>
<span># if app is running, focus it</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> -z <span>"</span>$APP_PID<span>"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then</span>
  <span># launch app</span>
  $APP_NAME
<span>else</span>
  <span># using the pid, find the window id, then focus it</span>
  wid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>wmctrl -lp | grep <span>"</span>$APP_PID<span>"</span> | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span><span>)</span>
  <span># -R moves the window to the current desktop AND brings it to focus</span>
  wmctrl -iR <span>"</span>$wid<span>"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>lof</code>'s goal is to determine if an app is running and if it's not, launch it. If it is running, it stores the process id and correlates that to the window id. Once the window id is found, it focuses the window, using a tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmctrl">wmctrl</a>. For example, my usage of <code>lof</code> for firefox is:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
</code></pre></div><p><code>lof</code> expects to resolve the <strong>exact</strong> command when it runs <code>pgrep</code>, this enables <code>lof</code> to be very specific around what window it looks up. If you're interested in the gory details of how these pieces fit together, keep reading this section. Otherwise, you should skip to the next section.</p><p>To understand <code>lof</code>, it is important to understand how window ids and process ids are related. Technically, we can look up windows by their titles, however, many applications re-title their window based on the context of where the user is in the app. Thus, correlating process id to window id is preferable. Assuming firefox is running, you can lookup its window id with <code>wmctrl</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wmctrl -lp

0x01800003 -1 <span>899</span>    taco xfce4-panel
0x01000028 -1 <span>945</span>    taco Desktop
0x02e00006  <span>0</span> <span>1139</span>   taco tmux
0x0300004d  <span>0</span> <span>2804</span>   taco linux-desktop – lof
0x03200003  <span>0</span> <span>5276</span>   taco Arch Linux - Mozilla Firefox
0x06200006  <span>0</span> <span>7115</span>   taco VLC media player
</code></pre></div><p>In the above desktop, <em>Arch Linux - Mozilla Firefox</em> is clearly the firefox window. The process id is <code>5276</code> and the window id is <code>0x03200003</code>. Since <code>lof</code> resolves based on the process's command, we should look that up using the process id.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ps <span>5276</span>

PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
<span>5276</span> pts/2    Sl    13:49 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
</code></pre></div><p>And just like that, we know that <code>/usr/lib/firefox/firefox</code> is the correct argument to send to <code>lof</code>. When <code>lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox</code> is run, <code>pgrep</code> is used to resolve a process with that <strong>exact</strong> command. If <code>pgrep</code> returns no result, <code>lof</code> executes the command it was fed as an argument. If <code>pgrep</code> did find a result, it can use the process id to run the above <code>wmctrl -lp</code> command and resolve the window id via <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wmctrl -lp | grep <span>5276</span> | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span>

0x03200003
</code></pre></div><p>It then uses <code>wmctrl -iR</code> to focus the firefox window.</p><p>And that end-to-end is <code>lof</code>! There are times where some apps, such as those requiring JRE, need more love than <code>lof</code> can handle. In those cases, rather than making <code>lof</code> smarter, I chose to write a slightly modified script. You can find an example with my <a href="https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop/blob/master/s/lof_intellij">lof_intellij</a> script in GitHub.</p><h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2><p>The glue that holds this all together is the shortcuts or key bindings. For key bindings, I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys">xbindkeys</a>. The reason I prefer it over other tools, is its generic approach to capturing mouse or keyboard events. Captured events can execute scripts in <strong>any window manager</strong>. This means that when I randomly decide to switch back to dwm, all my keys bindings come with me.</p><p>xbindkeys, assuming it is installed, can be added to your <code>~/.xinitrc</code> file to launch when you start your window manager. An example of mine is:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">exec xrdb ~/.Xresources &amp;
xset r rate <span>150</span> <span>60</span> &amp;
<span># only required when wm does not have compositor</span>
<span># exec picom &amp;</span>
feh --bg-scale ~/photos/wallpapers/current.jpg &amp;
xbindkeys -p &amp;
<span># options are dwm, i3, and startxfce4</span>
exec startxfce4
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>-p</code> flag tells <code>xbindkeys</code> to poll the rc (configuration) file for changes. The last step is to setup this rc file to include the <code>lof</code> commands. The rc file is, by default, located at <code>~/.xbindkeysrc</code>. On my machine, a some of the configuration look as follows.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># launch demu</span>
<span>"dmenu_run -fn Hack-16:normal -l 5"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:65
    Mod4 + space

<span># launch browser</span>
<span>"lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:45
    Mod4 + k

<span># launch or focus terminal</span>
<span>"lof st\ \-e\ tmux"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:44
    Mod4 + j

<span># launch or focus nemo</span>
<span>"lof nemo"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:40
    Mod4 + d
</code></pre></div><p>You can see the many uses of <code>lof</code>. The quoted text is the script to be run when an event is detected for the key codes below it. <code>xbindkeys</code> offers a simple way to figure out these key strokes. You run <code>xbindkeys -k</code> and hit the key you want to resolve. For example, this is the result of <code>mod</code> (window key) + <code>e</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xbindkeys -k

Press combination of keys or/and click under the window.
You can use one of the two lines after <span>"NoCommand"</span>
in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc to bind a key.
<span>"(Scheme function)"</span>
    m:0x4 + c:26
    Control + e
</code></pre></div><p>Now, assume you want to use that as a keyboard shortcut for the GUI app <code>blueman-manager</code> (a bluetooth utility). With the app running, you lookup the command.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ps aux | grep -i blueman-manager

<p>How Emacs beat vi in the Editor Wars</p>
<p>August 11, 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://trevorjim.com/how-emacs-beat-vi-in-the-editor-wars/">∞</a></p>
<p>In these dark times, we are all in sore need of good news.
Thankfully, I can report some: Emacs has defeated vi in the Editor
Wars!</p>
<p>Some people, laughably, believe that vi is more popular than Emacs.
Fortunately, these fools are completely wrong, and it is easily
proven.</p>
<p>Here’s how.  Take out an iPhone and get it set up with a Bluetooth
keyboard.  Open a web browser and start typing in the address bar.
Try a few Emacs key bindings: control-a (move-beginning-of-line);
control-e (move-end-of-line); control-b (backward-char); control-k
(kill-line); control-d (delete-char); control-y (yank).</p>
<p>That’s right, Emacs is in your phone browser!  With more than 2
billion iPhones shipped, that’s more than 2 billion Emacs
installations.  And if you try other phone or desktop browsers you
just might find that Emacs is in those as well.  But you won’t find
vi.</p>
<p>QED, losers!</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-key-bindings">The importance of key bindings</h2>
<p>Perhaps you are wondering, is it really fair to judge the dominance of
Emacs solely based on key bindings?  What about all of the other ways
in which Emacs is superior to vi?</p>
<p>Rest easy, friend.  Consider that most users of any editor only use
basic features, such as the ones mentioned above (moving to the end of
a line, deleting a line, etc.).  For these users, Emacs and vi are
functionally equivalent—each as powerful as the other.</p>
<p>So, if two editors have the same functionality, what distinguishes one
from another?  It is the way that the editor exposes editing functions
to the user—the user interface.  And for Emacs and vi, which were
created in the early days of text-based terminals without mice, that
means the keyboard interface, i.e., their key bindings.</p>
<h2 id="how-emacs-key-bindings-are-superior-to-vi-key-bindings">How Emacs key bindings are superior to vi key bindings</h2>
<p>We have proven that Emacs key bindings are superior to vi key
bindings: Emacs has won the marketplace, while vi heads to extinction.
But <em>why</em> are they better?</p>
<p>To answer this we defer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler">Larry
Tesler</a>, who
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/2212877.2212896">developed</a>
the now-ubiquitous editor functions, Cut and Paste.  Before Cut and
Paste, moving a block of text in a document was a complex, multi-step
command in editors: it was a <em>mode</em> of the editor, distinct from other
operations such as moving the cursor or inserting characters.</p>
<p>Tesler’s Cut and Paste enables moving a block of text <em>without</em>
introducing a new mode.  In between the operations of Cut and Paste
the user can insert characters and move the cursor as usual; the
normal mode of insert/cursor movement, combined with a simple Cut and
a simple Paste, allows you to move a block of text.  You don’t have to
learn a new, complex mode for this.</p>
<p>This is what Tesler called <em>modelessness</em>.  Now, in reality every
editor has more than one mode, but Tesler argued that fewer modes make
editors easier to use, and Emacs and vi demonstrate this nicely.</p>
<p>There’s an old joke about vi: <em>Once you use vi, you’ll never quit.</em>
This of course refers to the fact that frequently in vi you’ll get
stuck in a mode that you can’t get out of, because you’ve forgotten
what mode you are in, or you’ve forgotten the key binding to get to
the mode in which you can exit vi.  So for example, vi has a mode
where you can insert characters; a different mode where you can move
the cursor, delete lines, and so on; and yet another mode in which you
can do things like quit the editor.  And depending on which mode you
are in, you have to hit a different sequence of keys to quit the
editor.  That’s why “How do I quit vi?” is such a popular Google
search.</p>
<p>Emacs, in contrast, starts out in a mode in which you can do <em>all</em> of
those things.  It crams all of that functionality into one mode by,
you guessed it, using <em>a lot</em> of key bindings involving modifiers like
the Control key and Meta key.</p>
<p>Emacs, to be sure, has many more modes than this, however, most of
these modes simply <em>extend</em> the fundamental mode with <em>more</em> key
bindings to invoke the additional functionality.  Thus the quit
command can be invoked by the same key binding in any mode!  Another
way of putting it is that all of the finger knowledge that an Emacs
user has will probably apply regardless of what mode Emacs happens to
be in.</p>
<p>This is why Emacs, and not vi, is present in the iPhone browser.  It
allows the browser to have advanced functionality (such as moving to
the beginning or end of the address bar) without introducing a new
mode, and <em>without interfering with the simple task of inserting
characters</em>.  This ensures that users who don’t need <em>or aren’t even
aware of</em> the advanced functionality will never get stuck in a
different editing mode.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-emacs">Beyond Emacs</h2>
<p>Emacs is a wonderful editor but nowadays editors are not so important.
Most of the time we are consuming content instead of generating it.
The web browser is now the center of the software universe.  And
although browsers have a little bit of Emacs in their address bars,
the rest of their user interface has taken a big step backwards from
Emacs: their keyboard support is poor.  It’s impossible to operate
most web browsers using <em>only</em> a keyboard, without a mouse or
touchscreen.</p>
<p>There have been a few side efforts to add keyboard navigation to
popular web browsers.  <a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a> has been my
favorite, but it doesn’t seem to have much of a future, as it depends
on old, unsupported technology (XULRunner).  Of current efforts, I
like <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl">Tridactyl</a>, but it only
works with Firefox (for now), and its key bindings are inspired by vi,
not Emacs.</p>
<p>A more fundamental problem is that browser makers simply don’t care
about keyboard navigation, or at least they are incompetent about it.
Their extension capabilities are crippled and their key binding
support is too.  We may be waiting a long time for the Emacs of web
browsers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is <strong>known to be needed</strong> in the product.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog">The Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Ideas do not fit that description. An idea is a “maybe this would be helpful” thing, not an “I know this is needed” thing.</p>



<p>If you have ideas for your product, that’s fantastic and fabulous and you should hang onto them. But please don’t use the backlog for that. Use a roadmap or a hierarchy or a storymap or a text file or literally anything that’s not the backlog.</p>



<p><em>When the time comes to officially plan and refine one of those ideas, that’s when you move it into the backlog. </em></p>



<p>A backlog with things in it that are not <strong>known to be needed</strong> is a backlog with waste. It’s a mountain of inventory to wade when you want to find a specific part. </p>



<p>Here are some signs that your backlog has too much stuff in it:</p>



<ul><li>You’re embarrassed to show it to people, like a messy kitchen</li><li>You start to keep a separate list of important things because you’re worried they’ll get lost and forgotten in the backlog </li><li>You get stressed out when you look at it</li><li>There are tickets from 3+ months ago</li><li>There are tickets that you had forgotten all about</li><li>There are tickets that you don’t even understand</li></ul>



<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. Keep a lean, focused backlog with only the stuff you know you will work on in the next couple cycles, and stop digging through hundreds of tickets you may never get around to starting. </p>



<p>Give yourself the focus and stress relief that comes with a backlog that is free of fluff. It’ll make it easier to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">shut up and plan the sprint</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>After I have moved from a tiny tiny apartment 9m^2 in Tokyo to a big one 3LDK (2 western-style rooms, kitchen, living/dining room, and tatami room) I decided that I am going to use one of the westerner rooms as my home office/laboratory and with this idea, a lot of project ideas appeared in my head what I could do with my home office. One of the first projects which I have already finished was getting an Air Conditioner in the home office room</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-7.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-7.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-7.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I bought two Panasonic ACs for the home office and bedroom. The living room already had an air conditioner. They are pretty small and. efficient units for 6 tatamis sized room (~9.72m^2)</p><p>As a European from North Europe Japanese spring/summer has hitten hard for an unexpected guy coming from a different continent. The weather until late May was without any issues pleasant temperatures sunny days and then <strong>THE Rainy Season</strong> came which introduced me with the new term <strong>Humidity</strong> to which I was never used or never had much concern living in Europe. When your room humidity level reaches 70-80% you would want to reduce the humidity level quickly as high humidity can introduce a lot of problems for your apartment. This is where Air Conditioner comes which helps with these issues by utilizing Dehumidifier mode which reduces humidity in the room pretty quickly.</p><p>After this unexpectedly pretty long Rainy season the real summer came up with really high temperatures as far as 35-45ºC which were devastating as my apartment was the top floor so it would heat up to around 32ºC in the home office room as soon as 8 AM. So the air conditioner was a must item in my home office!</p><p>Not to forget the winters in Tokyo can get mildly cold too, but so you know Japanese apartments in most cases lack any central heating system so you have few options to warm up urself:</p><ul><li>Electric Fan Heater (Most common device in Europe I think)</li><li>Electric Radiator</li><li>Electric Infrared Heater</li><li>Electric Blanket</li><li>Kerosine Heater</li><li>Gas Fan Heater</li><li>Gas Heater</li></ul><p>Yes I know burning stuff inside the apartment for westerners would sound crazy but most Japanese apartments there are special pipes/tubes in walls with covers for exhaust fumes, etc. same with air conditioners their special pipes for passing air conditioner refrigerant/electrical lines to the outside.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-8.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-8.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-8.png 1002w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You probably would not believe if I told you that the small square socket near the bottom big pipe is a gas outlet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>There are plenty of DevOps myths&nbsp;circulating the developers’&nbsp;community. This is no surprise, considering how much excitement the DevOps concept has brought&nbsp;over the recent years.</p>



<p>The DevOps methodology can provide significant positive effects for organizations when implemented properly. It can <strong>lower costs, boost efficiency</strong>, and <strong>make the work of development teams more streamlined</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in order to grasp the strength of this&nbsp;process, it is necessary to recognize what DevOps represents. That’s why, in this article, we address some of the most popular DevOps myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 1: DevOps is all about CI/CD&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s the same thing as CI/CD. The truth is that continuous integration and delivery are <strong>the key components of DevOps</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DevOps focuses on the culture and responsibility in a team. It emphasizes the need for everyone on the team to take part in each other’s tasks. This improves <strong>collaboration and communication</strong> in the team.</p>



<p>On the other hand, CI/CD enables this culture with software and tools that emphasize automation. You can see them as <strong>a means to an end</strong>.</p>



<h2>Myth 2: DevOps means NoOps</h2>



<p>NoOps describes the concept where the cloud infrastructure is so automated, that there is no need to manage it.</p>



<p>NoOps is considered as<strong> the next evolution of DevOps</strong> as a development model. Just like DevOps, its goal is to improve software delivery, but by allowing developers to focus on application development instead of infrastructure and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, you can automate the setup, deployment, and monitoring processes, getting closer to NoOps.</p>



<h2>Myth 3: Automation eliminates all bottlenecks&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Automation is one of the biggest benefits that DevOps provides. But <strong>it’s not a silver bullet</strong> that will solve all your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A continuous delivery process enables teams to roll out new features quickly. And, get the feedback they need really fast. This, of course, means that you have to ensure the product’s quality. Moreover, you have to take care of how well it runs and its performance when scaling. You also need to ensure smooth production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automating your CI/CD pipelines helps <strong>eliminate the bottlenecks between code commit and deploy.</strong> But, this is just one stage of the software delivery process. Unless developers and testers are in a partnership, you won’t be able to resolve all your problems. It’s likely that you’ll only move any bottlenecks to another stream.</p>



<h2>Myth 4: One-size-fits-all continuous delivery pipeline</h2>



<p>The idea that you can have one process that fits all teams and companies is impossible, contrary to popular belief. Every organization has <strong>different needs and requirements</strong>. Even projects in the same organization need different continuous delivery pipelines.</p>



<p>You can have projects that need only two to three environments. For example, development, test, and production environments with frequent deployments. Another project can require more environments since it has multiple stages in the software delivery cycle.</p>



<p>This is why the continuous delivery pipeline should <strong>represent the release process</strong> that the company is already using.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 5: DevOps is all about tools</h2>



<p>Conversations about DevOps are mostly focused around which tools your company is using. They then turn into philosophical battles about what are the best tools. Instead, we should be <strong>communicating about the bigger picture</strong>, the business value DevOps brings to your company.</p>



<p>DevOps means focusing on <strong>culture, mindset, and how individuals work together.</strong> Only after should you be choosing the right tools for your processes. Teams often look in the large ecosystem of tools trying to find the perfect solution at the beginnings. They build DevOps pipelines for a very long time, that should be redone once completed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a87265a6-4a4d-4905-97e9-4129ac78563c/Atlassian%20DevOps%20Trends%20Survey%202020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlassian research</a> showed that the two main factors to implement DevOps successfully are <strong>the right tools and the right people</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>DevOps automation tools like <a href="https://microtica.com/">Microtica</a> allow you to create pipelines and test them in hours.</strong> With these kinds of tools, you can save months of work on pipelines that might not function. </p>



<h2>Myth 6: Software release is the same as in Amazon/Facebook/Google</h2>



<p>Many world-leading companies have adopted DevOps for its benefits and flexibility. Looking at these company’s success stories, we, of course, look up to their achievements. We do this without realizing their context and the steps they made to become that successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing is for sure – these organizations <strong>chose and built the tools and processes that worked best for them at the time</strong>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to follow these organizations. Moreover, what they did won’t magically work for our business as well.</p>



<p>We should learn from them and find new ways to innovate and grow. Explore and find the right processes and tools that define our problem space. What will bring <strong>success to our particular business</strong>? This is what DevOps is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 7: Release all the time</h2>



<p>The idea of frequent releases has companies worried about not releasing their software continuously enough. <em>“Ship often”</em> has become the industry standard. However, this doesn’t specify the time. It may be every two to three weeks, or it may be several times a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing is that you achieve the<strong> team confidence</strong> that enables you to release new software when required. CD is the <strong>ability to release code from the main branch and feel confident in it</strong>. The idea of DevOps is that your code should be releasable anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So remember, continuous delivery doesn’t mean you should release as often as you can but gives you the ability to release <strong>as often as you want.</strong> <em>How often should be up to your company’s decision.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>We hope this&nbsp;article helped you bust some of the most popular DevOps myths that&nbsp;swirl around. Don’t let such misunderstandings hinder the progress of your team. Implementing DevOps can help your company improve productivity and create better products, so don’t miss out on these benefits due to these DevOps myths. </p>

<p>Distributed teams are hard. Distributed teams, where some people are in office and others at home, are harder. Widely distributed teams with people working across countries and time zones are exceptionally hard. <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/05/25/working-remotely-social-communication/">Widely distributed teams in a pandemic are damn near impossible to get right</a>.</p>



<p>Culture clash alone is an enormous challenge. I once had a fantastic American product manager piss off an equally strong director of engineering (in India) by complaining that the tool the PM needed “had fallen and can’t get up.” The director—and the engineers on the thread—took it as a tremendous insult, even though the product manager was trying to inject a little levity. The PM should have linked to the commercial:</p>

</p><figcaption>Apparently <a href="http://lifecall.com/">Lifecall</a> isn’t big in India.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Distance, culture, and time zone problems make communicating in remote teams hard.</p>



<p>We have spent trillions of electrons this year on how to lead remote teams, so I’ll stick to something more prosaic: communication tools.</p>



<blockquote><p>Slack, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Zoom – the communication tools you use matter, but not as much as how your organization uses them.</p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=Slack%2C%20Jira%2C%20Microsoft%20Teams%2C%20Zoom%20-%20the%20communication%20tools%20you%20use%20matter%2C%20but%20not%20as%20much%20as%20how%20your%20organization%20uses%20them.&amp;url=https://joseph.by/2020/09/03/how-to-use-communication-tools-well-in-remote-teams/&amp;via=josephby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>Over the past twelve years I have worked in four different distributed organizations. From bootstrapped start-ups to legacy companies. I often found <strong>a lack of alignment caused by the inconsistent use of communication tools</strong>. Solving this required us to be way more intentional in how we communicate.</p>



<p>You need to, as a group, brainstorm, agree to, and communicate out norms of how different communications tools are to be used. When it works you get a written, jointly owned artifact that you can use to orient new team members and bolster the confidence of quieter team members. And when the rules are set up front, collaboratively, people are more like to follow them, and not need correction down the road (which could offend them).</p>



<h2>My List</h2>



<p>So here’s my list of communication tools and how to use them.</p>



<h3>Face to Face Meetings</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that need synchronous communications. Hard (“critical”) conversations. Generative exercises. Things that require dialog. Design meetings, planning meetings, <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08">betting tables</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Status meetings. Networking conversations. Routine discussions.</p>



<h3>Video or Audio Conferences</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that require synchronous attention but less dialog. Structured discussions. Ideally, decisions that are less contentious. Prioritization exercises, design reviews, presentations of an analysis. Collaboration where a small number of people are presenting to a larger number of people.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Energy levels. Remember, <strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/5-reasons-why-zoom-meetings-are-so-exhausting-137404">video is draining</a></strong>. Use it sparingly. Find other ways to ensure that all participants are “present” and attentive. You know your team is healthy if it is present without being threatened by the green camera LED. If numbers admit <strong>take turns, at least once, to make make sure that everyone has a chance to be heard.</strong></p>



<h3>Email</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Asynchronous, text-heavy communication. Wide distribution groups. Not time sensitive. Easy to read (no need to click away to see the content). Things that people may want to consider and respond to. Monthly status update to investors or senior leadership. Summarizes of organizational changes.</p>



<p><strong>Major </strong>🔑<strong>:</strong> Put the most important information into the subject line and lede (<a href="https://joseph.by/2016/09/14/6-prepare-your-intent-a-little-preparation/">more here</a>). Make sure your emails are easy to read on mobile devices.</p>



<h3>Phone and Text</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Getting a hold of someone after hours or while they are away from keyboard (e.g. in transit) and you need a dialog. If you need to get a hold of someone for an emergency after hours, and want a last resort before actually calling them, or don’t need an immediate synchronous response. Always text first #BecauseIts2020 .</p>



<h3>Chat</h3>



<p><strong>Patterns:</strong> Establish clear norms as to when people are / are not expected to be available on slack; use threads to allow people to follow topics. Be aware of timezones; encourage use of Away messages. <strong>Train people on how to manage their notifications, alert settings, and Do Not Disturb. </strong>Don’t assume they’ll figure it out, or will feel comfortable turning it off. <strong>Use public channels</strong>, created for topics, teams and projects. </p>



<p><strong>Anti-patterns:</strong> This is going to need a bulleted list.</p>



<ul><li>Remember that <strong>text loses tone</strong>, and that low-fidelity communication tools like chat can amplify management mistakes. Give people the benefit of the doubt when they seem clueless but <strong>do not tolerate behavior that makes people feel unsafe, particularly by those with power</strong>.</li><li><strong>Chat transcripts ≠ documentation.</strong> If you agree on a behaviour or solution to a problem then <strong>document it somewhere</strong> and link to it from the conversation.</li><li><strong>Chat messages ≠ to-dos</strong> or workflow tasks. If someone agrees to do something in slack, create a ticket in the relevant tracking tool and link to it from the conversation.</li><li><strong>Avoid using #general</strong>. Real conversations should happen in dedicated channels.</li><li><strong>Avoid using group messages:</strong> they’re hard to find, not categorized by topic, and carry and unclear expectation of privacy.</li><li><strong>Limit the use of private channels:</strong> again, they are hard to search and risky to add people to. If people only feel safe in private team channels something bigger is wrong with your organization.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, <strong>chat makes bad managers worse</strong>. The combination of immediacy, reach, lack of nuance, and lack of non-verbal feedback can encourage some incredibly stupid behaviour that can be hard to undo.</p>



<h3>Wiki</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Documentation, references, working documents; Version tracking important;  High-fidelity (fancy formatting) not important</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Things that imply sequence. Workflows, etc.</p>



<h3>Bug Tracking or Workflow Management Tools</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that have a deadline, dependencies, multi-step tasks, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Requirements, specs, designs – anything more than a few lines shouldn’t live in the bug, but should be linked out to a doc from the bug. Bug tracking tools are hell to search.</p>



<h3>Documents</h3>



<p>This includes Google/Word Docs, Slides/Powerpoint/Keynote and Sheets/Excel</p>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Narratives or analyses; work that needs a lot of formatting and high fidelity. Work that changes slowly. Read-aheads for meetings. <strong>Group editing</strong>. Google Docs still has the best commenting tools, although wikis like Confluence has come a long way.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Requirements. Reference documents. Documents that are expected to be maintained over a long period of time. After a project is over things like Word Documents are typically lost in a shared folder, hidden away, and never used again.</p>



<p><strong>Major </strong>🔑<strong>:</strong> Tuck documents away neatly after a project. If they are no longer being updated, add a prominent note to that effect in the top of the document, with a link to other relevant, and more recent information (i.e. a Wiki). <strong>Manage the zombies.</strong></p>



<h2>Things to remember</h2>



<p><strong>Avoid holy wars.</strong> Focus on picking the smallest number of tools that cover the greatest number of use cases, weighted by importance. <strong>Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good</strong>, but be aware of tools with high switching costs (bug tracking, chat) and be careful.</p>



<p>Remember that <strong>the process is as important as the outcome</strong>. You want to have broad support for the list so that influential team members feel ownership and will actively help to improve communication. And finally, <strong>don’t be cheap</strong>. Buy the right version of the tools and <strong>spend the money needed to get them configured and maintained property</strong>. If well paid software engineers are cutting and pasting tickets between bug tracking systems, I will find you.</p>



<p>Above all, <strong>expect change</strong>. How an organization communicates will change. Plan for it.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>In a distributed organization, leading well requires <strong>intentional communication</strong>. Intentional communication requires the effective, consistent use of digital tools. To achieve this:</p>



<ul><li>take an inventory of the communication tools in use,</li><li>crowd source and align on the specific <strong>tools you are going to use</strong> and <strong>how you’re going to use them</strong>,</li><li>write <strong>patterns</strong>, <strong>anti-patterns</strong>, and <strong>starting points</strong> for each–make norms explicit by writing them down,</li><li>share them widely, and finally,</li><li>revise them often to keep them useful.</li></ul>



<p>One last thing. Communication is good, but <strong>too much communication is not a healthy signal</strong>. People need time to think, plan and work. They should not be thrashing endlessly between Slack, Jira and Docs. So make sure that people know how to protect their time and are able to set boundaries, get work done, and feel as though they are accomplishing things.</p>

    <p>This is the guide through the observability space to assist you with planning observability of your next project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Observability</strong> is ability of your system to expose data about its performance and behavior so we can further monitor, analyze and alert on certain trends or changes. Making your system observable requires certain effort in your project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care</h2>

<p><img src="https://rastko.tech/images/observability1_1.jpg"></p>

<p>Observability of your system is the <strong>top non-functional requirement</strong>. In my opinion, not even application performance tops observability. It is absolutely necessary that you know what is happening in your system at any given time and <strong>in level of detail necessary to be able to keep everything running smoothly by adequately reacting to change in te system</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, there is a possibility that you do not share this opinion, in which case you would,probably, rather develop your product, do a bit of testing, UAT and push it out. Probably because it requires certain amount of work and is considered non essential as you start. If Google Analytics is all you need, I am not here to argue that, refer back here when you change your mind. If, however, you want to dive into this topic and start planning, I want to share some insights that should help you pin down stuff that is most important for you and prioritize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are quite a few aspects of observability in service oriented architecture, and in this article I will be focusing on discussing every aspect with little bit of depth in order to help you better understand, focus and plan developing your observability. To help you plan and have a broader conversation with all the people involved in planning your project, I will provide some insight into most popular stacks as well and give insights into most important defining factors.</p>

<p>Your system being observable can mean multiple things on as many levels, but generally, it means that system exposes data that we can consume to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monitor system in real time.</li>
  <li>Alert or perform some automated task based on defined data state, or rather a change of state.</li>
  <li>Analyze and predict behaviors, requirements etc…</li>
  <li>Do a detailed analysis of the incident or any distinct event in the system.</li>
  <li>Any combination of above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it is all about using proper tools, let’s spend some time on quick discussion about what we need and what tool/type of observability we choose.</p>

<h2 id="characterizing-capabilities">Characterizing capabilities</h2>

<p>When we talk observability of the system, way we are planning it really depends on what we want to achieve. Ultimately, we would love to achieve everything, but some ability to focus and plan would be nice. Let us take a look at some factors to take into account when prioritizing observability.</p>

<p><strong>Main types of data:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Logs</strong> - Old, but gold. First that ever existed, has all the data about what is going on, but slow, hard to process and needs huge system throughput to bring usage close to real time. You can still go to the file that was generated last and grep it for particular phrase or just look for the time when error happened, which will forever be my favorite thin I ever learned how to do (apart from making pizza from scratch).</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> - Quick, flexible, made for quick availability and low throughput requirement, easy and long retention. Not too much data per unit of information, real time trend analysis and reaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Traces</strong> - Everything you would like to know about call you made, seems like magic especially in well instrumented distributed system. Sometimes slower then logs, but allows for deeper analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Performance qualities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usability</strong> - Do metrics allow a good way to monitor and analyze them, with flexibility in data architecture to give enough versatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed/throughput requirements</strong> - how much metrics system can take before receiving some performance penalty. Also, how fast are the metrics available for consumption/use (both manual and automated).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Way we plan to consume data:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - real time plotting and observation of system state.</li>
  <li><strong>Alerting and automatic triggers</strong> - reacting to events by broadcasting notification or triggering events.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics</strong> - analyzing collected data to gather useful learnings about system and/or perform <strong>root cause analysis (RCA)</strong> of problem in the past (usual case) or ongoing problem (more rare since Analytics is mostly about applying complex algorithms to big data sets to draw conclusions, and that takes time).</li>
</ul>

<p>We can quickly draft a following table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Performance/ Throughput needs</th>
      <th>Recommended for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Logs</td>
      <td>Medium / Medium - still lots of text</td>
      <td>RCA/Monitoring/Alerting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Metrics</td>
      <td>Fast / Low - smallest unit of data</td>
      <td>Monitoring/Alerting/Analytics</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Traces</td>
      <td>Slow / High - contains lots of data</td>
      <td>RCA, Alerting in some setups</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="creating-observability">Creating observability</h2>

<p>As you are building a system, no matter if it is a huge monolithic application, or a multiservice-something, planning observability you want to achieve will get you places. For that you’ll have to know what kind of tools you need and what additional infrastructure will it take… of course, but there is also a choice of where to start. It is less obvious, but deciding to do everything might be costly decision depending on how much time you got to deliver first version of your system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DevOps</strong> - in this moment it is worth mentioning that for most of the stuff that I write, I assume your goal is full DevOps, and that your team is building everything and running it in all the environments. If you are getting something pre built, you have army of engineers or reasonably long timelines there might be a way to get it all in time .</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Generally, you do not need to do anything in order for your system to start gathering logs, logs will be available to you anywhere from default log directory for the OS of choice to Kubernetes logs. What you will need is everything else - literally.</p>

<p>Going from just a stack of call logs inside a gazillion line file on disc to searchable log database that can also be used for certain level of alerting and many different applications is the matter of planning. I usually recommend two well known stacks, that differ in log collection segment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">ELK</a> - Elastic, Logstash, Kibana which is more standard one</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-elasticsearch-fluentd-and-kibana-efk-logging-stack-on-kubernetes">EFK</a>- Elastic, Fluentd, Kibana which is more flexible one in terms of data flow management and further design scalability. It is also recommended for Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess everyone loves 3-letter abbreviations so nobody bothered to add F at start of both, since it became a standard. F for <a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to setup EXK and Filebeat, Filebeat will pick up the logs as they arrive to any of mentioned standard log outputs and send them to log collector, that gets stored into Elastic database so logs will be indexed and made searchable and visualizable through Kibana.</p>

<p>Obviously, more activity you got in your system, more logs there is, more data throughput becomes crucial for your logs to get to you - Filebeat needs to send logs to Elastic that then needs to index them (on the way there is a throughput of whatever you use). I have seen cases of hundreds of terrabytes of logs a day with need of month to 3 months retention… It becomes whole separate system to maintain.</p>

<p>The good thing is that, when overwhelmed, these setups are quite good in the degrading performance but keeping data, so if you do not run out of physical hardware and everything just halts, your logs may be late to Kibana because elastic can’t index, or they might be stuck in some queue, but they will not be lost. That is, at least, something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In the wild</strong></p>

  <p>Stack itself is relatively easy to deploy with lots of resources available online, from tutorials to docker-composed sets, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> submodules and<a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> charts to do it for you. First hard thing to do is set everything right first time from the delivery of logs perspective. Second hard thing to do is not to kill your logging stack with too much or too big logs.</p>

  <p>Good luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p><img src="https://rastko.tech/images/observability1_3.jpg"></p>

<p>On the metrics side of things are lot different then on the logs side of things - although there is general majority choice of a tool, and thus a approach to it, there are actually two different approaches based on a way metrics are exposed / collected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull - used by wider accepted and <a href="https://www.cncf.io/cncf-prometheus-project-journey/">CNCF adopted Prometheus</a></li>
  <li>Push - used by StatsD</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on two stand out representatives of two groups, I will provide quick comparison.</p>

<h4 id="pull---prometheus">Pull - Prometheus</h4>

<p><a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> is my current metrics collection stack of choice, developed by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> and fully promoted ot open source in 2015, although it was available for longer.</p>

<p>Pull means that metrics collector is scraping services that are being monitored by it. In turn, system requires that any service that needs to be monitored by Prometheus exposes metrics. Data exposition format allows “condensation” of the metrics that are exposed, so they basically can accumulate until scraped for both variable scraping intervals, but also the longer periods in case of incidents with collector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metrics are kept in service’s memory until collector pulls (scrapes) the metrics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The architecture of the metrics collection and way Prometheus is built gives us two important architectural advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resilliance</strong> - If Prometheus collector dies for some time, metrics are not lost because they are kept in service’s memory until scraped</li>
  <li><strong>Federation</strong> - same way the service exposes metrics to be collected by Prometheus, Prometheus itself can expose aggregated metrics to be collected by other Prometheus system, allowing for metrics collection scaling by creating tree …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is part of a <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expressions/">Series On Regular Expressions</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will discuss regular expression quantifiers with the ultimate goal of developing a very deep understanding of how they work. &nbsp;In fact, by the end of this article you'll understand quantifiers so well, that you'll be able to extend your knowledge to invent a completely new quantifier has never been seen before in any regular expression engine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of this article, you will understand everything in the following diagram:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantifiers are used to quantify how many times a part of your regular expression should be repeated. &nbsp;Every time you want to repeat something in a regex (an individual character, a character class or a sub-expression) you can write a quantifier after it to specify how many times it should be repeated.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following list shows some examples of the most common quantifiers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>*</strong></li>
<li><strong>+</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{,N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,M}</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article will only discuss these quantifiers within the context of Perl-like regular expressions (<em>not</em> POSIX regular expressions). &nbsp;This is worth mentioning since the older POSIX style regular expression quantifiers lack certain features, and have significantly different behaviour in some cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most typical guides to regular expressions would probably start by immediately diving into a detailed description of what each of these symbols does. &nbsp;They would probably start by explaining the meaning of the '*', '+', and '?' symbols. &nbsp;However, <em><strong>this won't be your typical guide to regular expressions</strong></em>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we'll start by focusing on understanding this quantifier:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this atypical approach is simple: &nbsp;Once you understand what <em>this</em> quantifier does, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;Let's do a few examples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume you need to write a regular expression that can match both spellings of the word 'enroll'. &nbsp;The word 'enroll' can sometimes be spelled with one 'l' or two 'l's depending on whether the author chooses to use British or American spelling conventions. &nbsp;Using this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll be able to match both spellings of 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a link to an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=enrol%7B1%2C2%7D">interactive visualization of the regex enrol{1,2}</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the quantifier is the '{1,2}' part. &nbsp;The '{1,2}' quantifier can be interpreted in English to mean "Whatever came just before this quantifier, repeated anywhere from 1 to 2 times.". &nbsp;If you wanted to change the regex to also match any misspellings of 'enroll' that have 3 'l's, you could just change the upper bound of the range from 2 to 3:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, using the regex above, you can match all three spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could go even further and change the regex to include misspellings that don't have any 'l's at all, by decreasing the lower bound of the range 0:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{0,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the regex above, you can match these four (miss)spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enro</li>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern that this quantifier uses should now be a bit more obvious: &nbsp;Whenever we want specify that the previous character can be repeated a lower bound of N times up to an upper bound of M times, we can write this quantifier after the character:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the letters 'N' and 'M' here are placeholders that are used for the purposes of documentation. &nbsp;In reality, you would never literally write '{N,M}' as a quantifier in your regular expression. &nbsp;You would would write something like '{2,8}', '{0,20}' or any other pair of positive integers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make things crystal clear, there are a few cases where the endpoints of the range are not explicitly written, but are instead implied. &nbsp;Here is an example:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of this quantifier is to repeat the character 'a' anywhere from (it doesn't matter times) to 5 times. &nbsp;Another way to describe the same thing would be to say "repeat the character 'a' anywhere from 0 times to 5 times" which you could do with the following equivalent regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll sometimes see the same thing with the upper bound of the range:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in these cases the upper end of the range is assumed to be "Infinity", however there is no equivalent way to write this explicitly. &nbsp;You simply can't write something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,Infinity} (This does not work)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since most regex engines will default to interpreting the range quantifier as literal text if it doesn't see the format it expects. &nbsp;Therefore, when the upper bound of your range is 'infinity', you must simply omit the second number like this: '{3,}'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final important case to consider is when a single number is used to describe that the previous character should be matched <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified. &nbsp;For example, this regex will match any sequence of <em>exactly</em> 4 'a' characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted to re-write this using a range, we could write:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4,4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which means the same thing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the quantifiers we've reviewed so far, it should be clear that they can all be re-written in the following standardized form:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where</p>

<ul>
	<li>'N' is a positive integer.</li>
	<li>'M' is a positive integer OR left blank to represent 'infinity'.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still haven't discussed the meaning of the '?', '*' and '+' quantifiers, so let's do that now:</p>

<ul>
	<li>'<strong>?</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,1}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>*</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>+</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{1,}</strong>'.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%3F&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '?' quantifier</a> that makes the character 'a' optional. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph splits into two possible paths: &nbsp;One that skips the character 'a', and one that requires it. &nbsp;If one path fails, the regular expression engine simply backtracks to try the other path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%2B&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '+' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' one or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by requiring an 'a' character. &nbsp;If there are no 'a' characters, it fails immediately. &nbsp;If there is at least one, control will split into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path goes back to try and get yet another 'a' character, and the other continues with the rest of the regex. &nbsp;By default, the regex engine will first try the path that consumes yet another 'a' character until there are no more in the search text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a*&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '*' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' zero or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by splitting into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path immediately continues on with the rest of the regex, and the other attempts to consume an 'a' character. &nbsp;By default, this quantifier will first try the path that consumes an 'a' character. &nbsp;Once it fails to find another 'a' character, it will give up and continue on with the rest of the regex.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a table to summarize what we've learned so far:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Quantifier Symbol</td><td>Normalized As A Range</td><td>What It Really Means</td></tr>
		<tr><td>?</td><td>{0,1}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to 1 times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>*</td><td>{0,}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>+</td><td>{1,}</td><td>"Repeated from 1 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N}</td><td>{N,N}</td><td>"Repeated from N to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{,N}</td><td>{0,N}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,}</td><td>{N,}</td><td>"Repeated from N to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,M}</td><td>{N,M}</td><td>"Repeated from N to M times."</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed previously, quantifiers can be used to specify how many times a character in your regular expression can be repeated:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you can also apply quantifiers to character classes too:</p>

<p><code><pre>[0-9]{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you could use this regular expression to match chapter titles in a book, regardless of how many digits are in the chapter number:</p>

<p><code><pre>[Cc]hapter [0-9]+
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most importantly, you can also apply a quantifier to a sub-expression to repeat a sequence of characters. &nbsp;For example this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(Hello){2,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHelloHello</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even apply quantifiers to a sub-expression that contains an alternation. &nbsp;This regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(cat|dog|bird){1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cat</li>
	<li>dog</li>
	<li>bird</li>
	<li>catcat</li>
	<li>catdog</li>
	<li>catbird</li>
	<li>dogcat</li>
	<li>dogdog</li>
	<li>dogbird</li>
	<li>birdcat</li>
	<li>birddog</li>
	<li>birdbird</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as promised earlier, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;There are many more quantifiers than what we've seen so far, but fortunately, there are only 4 fundamental aspects to every regular expression quantifier, and you'll understand them all by the end of this article. &nbsp;Here are those 4 aspects:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1)  The minimum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>2)  The maximum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li>3)  Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.</li>
	<li>4)  Whether it will disable backtracking or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you can see, we've already covered the first two, so 2/4 = 50% done.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's cover item #3 from the list above: "Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.". &nbsp;Consider a case where we want to match this regular expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{2,4}(aabbcc|bb)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against this piece of text:</p>

<p><code><pre>aaaabbcc
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can follow through the matching process with an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%7B2%2C4%7D(aabbcc%7Cbb)&amp;the_subject=aaaabbcc">interactive visualization of the matching process for this regex here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the quantifier '{2,4}' can match the 'a' anywhere from 2 times to 4 times, and the text we're searching starts with 4 consecutive 'a's, it's ok for the regular …</p></div></div></div>

<a href="https://blog.leonardofederico.com/2020/08/how-humans-unlock-social-capital.html">Picasso, Schoenberg, Moss: how humans unlock social capital</a>
</h3><p>
(See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24363273">HN thread</a> here.)</p><p>

Once every while I read something that changes my perspective on things. Usually, not because it reveals a ground-breaking truth, but because it helps me connect the dots backward. Suddenly, things are now integral parts of a larger picture and everything makes more sense.</p><p>

A year ago I read this piece from Eugene Wei: <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service" target="_blank">Status as a Service</a>.</p><p>

Eugene writes:</p><blockquote>
Why does proof of work matter for a social network? If people want to maximize social capital, why not make that as easy as possible? As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans. Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.</blockquote><p>
He continues:</p><blockquote>
Read Twitter today and hardly any of the tweets are the mundane life updates of its awkward pre-puberty years. We are now in late-stage performative Twitter, where nearly every tweet is hungry as hell for favorites and retweets, and everyone is a trained pundit or comedian. It's hot takes and cool proverbs all the way down. The harmless status update Twitter was a less thirsty scene but also not much of a business. Still, sometimes I miss the halcyon days when not every tweet was a thirst trap. I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye, the always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye, I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye.</blockquote><p>
Then, goes:</p><blockquote>
So, to answer an earlier question about how a new social network takes hold, let’s add this: a new Status as a Service business must devise some proof of work that depends on some actual skill to differentiate among users. If it does, then it creates, like an ICO, some new form of social capital currency of value to those users.</blockquote>
<p>
This didn't just resonate with me. It helped me understand on a deeper level how and why visual arts, aesthetics, music, and human taste in general develop.</p><p>

Let’s start from the ground up.</p><p>

In a few words, the article states that:</p><ul>
<li>Social Networks to thrive need a <i>proof of concept</i></li>
<li>Prohibitions spark human creativity in a newly formed area</li>
<li>Humans, then, leverage that creativity to attract social capital and compete against each other in the newly formed arena</li>
</ul><p>
Over a long enough timeline, all the social capital available in a certain system gets allocated.</p><p>

The more we understand a system, the more effective we are at allocating social capital in it. Hence, we need new restrictions to unlock new human creativity and feed new social capital back into the system.</p><p>

This can explain on some levels how Social Networks develops, but I wondered what else? Are there are other fields where this theory applies just as well?</p><h3>
1. Painting: Cubism</h3>
<p>
For centuries, visual arts was one of the major arenas where human intellects competed. For centuries, humans challenged each other by representing reality through mere copies of the same instance.</p><p>

And gradually, we were able to go from this..</p><p>

<img alt="La pinacoteca del deserto | Wall Street International Magazine" src="https://media.wsimag.com/attachments/b875394fe3e10f195aaf936aedab87d5379b5f93/store/fill/930/523/d201b041400d593bd503ef96371789c31f312481cfd248f0a901c5876477/Pitture-rupestri-di-Jabbaren-nominate-le-libere-donne-di-Jabbaren.jpg"></p><p>

To this:</p><p>

<img alt="Frederic Edwin Church | Biography, Art, &amp; Facts | Britannica" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/88/69588-050-87EF851C/View-Cotopaxi-oil-canvas-Frederic-Edwin-Church-1857.jpg"></p><p>

Connects the dots and see how linear was the progression in the aesthetic. Over time, humans became quite extraordinary at this exercise.</p><p>

Renaissance, impressionism, pointillism, abstract expressionism, realism, etc, were all micro-steps part of the same bigger effort: representing the reality for what it is.</p><p>

Social capital in that area was progressively getting allocated up to the point where there was no much left to. Over centuries of incremental progress, we got the point where we mastered the <i>proof of work</i>.</p><p>

So, we needed a radically new thing. A new greenfield and new proofs of concept.</p><p>

Introducing cubism.</p><p>

<img alt="Georges Braque 1882–1963 | Tate" src="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00445_9.jpg"></p><p>

Unlike any of the prior movements, cubisms challenged the fundamental rules, the basic assumptions upon which the system was constructed. Reality should be represented as<i>&nbsp;it is</i>.</p><p>

This new <i>proof of work</i> emphasized a flat, two-dimensional surface. It rejected the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, chiaroscuro, etc, and refuted time-honored theories of art as the imitation of nature.</p><p>

For the first time in history, painters were not bound to copying form, texture, color, space, etc. That was too well understood. They were called to present reality in radically fragmented objects, whose several sides were seen simultaneously.</p><p>

The movement was pioneered by Braque who made the original proof of concept but it was Picasso who really extracted much of the social capital that came out of it.</p><h3>
2. Music: Dodecaphony (or Twelve-tonic technique, or Chromaticism)</h3><p>
First, Bach, the real explorer of Classic composition.</p><p>

Then Mozart, and Beethoven.</p><p>

Then Chopin, Debussy, and Ravel.</p><p>

Different styles emerged across centuries (from Baroque to Late Romantic) but the ground rules in the classical composition didn’t really change.</p><p>

Let me explain.</p><p>

In traditional Western music, tonality is a means of organizing pitch in accordance with the physics of sound. A fundamental tone — say, C in a C major scale — is central; the other pitches relate to it in a hierarchy of importance based on natural overtone relationships. So, whatever happens, the music keeps returning to that fundamental tonal mooring.</p><p>

This is such a key aspect in music because it provides a sense of arrival and rest.</p><p>

All Western classical and pop music relies on the idea that, no matter what, we'll eventually get to "home base".</p><p>

Leveraging this musical axiom, musical composition techniques that had been prepared over centuries&nbsp;made it possible in the 18th century to write music that was original and immediately appealing but also sophisticated under the surface.</p><p>

And by the end of the 18th century, a lot of low-hanging fruit was picked and much of the social capital in the system was already allocated in the hands of few. There wasn't much left to discover.</p><p>

In 19th-century composers,&nbsp;Wagner, Mahler, Debussy, originality frequently came at the cost of greater surface complexity, and a less direct, cheerful tone.</p><p>

It was clear that humans needed new ground-up rules to compete.</p><p>

Schoenberg was one of the first to realize&nbsp;that new innovation could only be unlocked by re-thinking the ground-rules. So he invented a new<a href="http:/#" target="_blank">&nbsp;compositional technique:&nbsp;</a><a href="http:/#" target="_blank">twelve-tonic.</a></p><p>

<img alt="Arnold Schoenberg : Quartetto per Archi - Analisi Musicale" src="https://www.armoniamusicale.com/wp-content/uploads/Schoenberg-quartetto.jpg"></p><p>

Shoenberg's twelve tonic technique comes with no musical tonality. All 12 pitches of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music without emphasis on any specific note. In other words, all 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Consequentially, there can't home base.</p><p>

It was a radically new game.</p><p>

Shoenberg's new musical arena unlocked new social capital and many of the composers of the 20th century competed on those new rules.</p><p>

Several giants explored the 12-tone technique as well: not only Stravinsky, whose move into the enemy camp shook up the world of modern music but also Messiaen and Copland.</p><p>

Looking backward, we can say the invention of the 12-tone system was arguably the most audacious and influential development in 20th-century music.</p><h3>
3. Fashion: Kate Moss</h3>
<p>
The world of the 19th century was a world in which the canons of beauty were sculptured.</p><p>

Up to the point where the whole fashion scene was dominated by the same characters: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Sharon Stone, etc.</p><p>

That was a solved game.</p><p>

It was in that world, that <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10364017/Corinne-Day-the-woman-who-discovered-Kate-Moss.html" target="_blank">Corinne Day discovered a new way to represent beauty</a>.</p><p>

Not through the canonical blonde/long hair, nor the perfect-looking skin or the mesmerizing white of the teeth.</p><p>

C. Day used the cheeky expression of a 16yo suburban skinny girl named Kate Moss to show the world an entirely new idea of aesthetics.</p><p>

Way far from what were the conventions of the time.</p><p>

Not colorful, but black and white photos.<br>
Not sinuous, but skinny body forms.<br>
Not perfect-looking, but seemingly sloppy dresses.<br>
Not cheerful, but melancholic tones.</p><p>

<img alt="calvin klein kate moss Tiziano Magni kate-jam-and-diamonds •" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/0d7209dc40fe05243c9a9ea65b3da5b1/tumblr_n22mc1djTU1r9tciko1_500.jpg"></p><p>

It was a totally different game with totally different rules.</p><p>

The effects were immediate. Existing players were&nbsp;outplayed, new social capital was unlocked, and new icons emerged.</p><p>

Moss did to Campbell, what Braque did to Manet, and what Shoenberg did to centuries of Mozart.</p><p>

Centuries of slow but incremental linear development lost in a matter of a few years.</p><p>

Visual arts, philosophy, music, and many realms get periodically rearranged according to the same principles: when there’s no more Social Capital left on the table either because it eroded over centuries or because it was consolidated in the hands of just a few winners.</p><p>

After all, we're all are status-seeking monkeys seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"><p>React Hooks were introduced at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Conf October 2018</a> as a way to use state and side-effects (see lifecycle methods in class components) in React function components. Whereas function components have been called functional stateless components (FSC) before, they are finally able to use state with React Hooks and therefore many people refer to them as function components now.</p><p>In this walkthrough, I want to explain the motivation for React Hooks, what will change in React, and how React hooks can be used in function components by showcasing common React Hooks such as the state and effect Hooks by example. This tutorial is only an introduction to React Hooks. At the end of this tutorial, you will find many more tutorials to learn about React Hooks in depth.</p><h2 id="why-react-hooks"><a href="#why-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="why react hooks permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Why React Hooks?</h2><p>React Hooks were invented by the React team to introduce state management and side-effects in <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component">function components</a>. It's their way of making it more effortless to use only React function components without the need to refactor a React function component to a React class component for using lifecycle methods, in order to use have side-effects, or local state. React Hooks enable us to write React applications with only function components. Thus, there is no need to use class components anymore.</p><p><strong>Unnecessary Component Refactorings:</strong> Function components with React Hooks prevent unnecessary component refactorings. Previously, only React class components were used for local state management and lifecycle methods. The latter have been essential for introducing side-effects, such as listeners or data fetching, in React class components. The following shows a React class component with state management:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Component </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>super</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>You clicked </span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span> times</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          Click me</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> Counter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Only if you didn't need state or lifecycle methods, React functional <em>stateless</em> components could be used. And because React function components are more lightweight (and elegant), people already used plenty of function components. This came with the drawback of refactoring components from React function components to React class components every time state or lifecycle methods were needed (and vice versa). With Hooks there is no need for this refactoring. Side-effects and state are finally available in React function components. That's why a rebranding from functional stateless components to function components would be reasonable:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>count</span><span>,</span><span> setCount</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>You clicked </span><span>{</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span> times</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>count </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        Click me</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> Counter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p><strong>Side-effect Logic:</strong> In React class components, side-effects were mostly introduced in lifecycle methods (e.g. componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount). A side-effect could be <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data">fetching data in React</a> or <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-intersection-observer-api">interacting with the Browser API</a>. Usually these side-effects came with a setup and clean up phase. For instance, if you would miss to remove your listener, you could run into <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-warning-cant-call-setstate-on-an-unmounted-component">React performance issues</a>.</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyComponent</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>componentWillUnmount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, if you would introduce more than one of these side-effects in a React class component's lifecycle methods, all side-effects would be grouped by lifecycle method but not by side-effect. That's what React Hooks are going to change by encapsulating a side-effect in one hook whereas every hook has its own side-effect with a setup and clean up phase. You will see later in a tutorial how this works for real by adding and removing listeners in a React Hook.</p><p><strong>React's Abstraction Hell:</strong> Abstraction and thus reusability were introduced with <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-higher-order-components">Higher-Order Components</a> and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-render-props">Render Prop Components</a> in React. There is also <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context">React's Context with its Provider and Consumer Components</a> that introduce another level of abstraction. All of these advanced patterns in React are using so called wrapping components. The implementation of the following components shouldn't be foreign to developers who are creating larger React applications:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> compose</span><span>,</span><span> withReducer </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'recompose'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> withRouter </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react-router-dom'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> history</span><span>,</span><span> state</span><span>,</span><span> dispatch </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ThemeContext.Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Content</span><span> </span><span>theme</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>ThemeContext.Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>compose</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  withRouter</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>withReducer</span><span>(</span><span>reducer</span><span>,</span><span> initialState</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>App</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Sophie Alpert coined it "the wrapper hell" in React. You are not only seeing it in the implementation, but also when inspecting your components in the browser. There are dozens of wrapped components due to Render Prop Components (including Consumer components from React's Context) and Higher-Order Components. It becomes an unreadable component tree, because all the abstracted logic is covered up in other React components. The actual visible components are hard to track down in the browser's DOM. So what if these additional components were not needed because the logic is only encapsulated in functions as side-effects instead? Then you would remove all these wrapping components and flatten your component tree's structure:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useTheme </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'styled-components'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useRouter </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react-router-dom'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> theme </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useTheme</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> history </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useRouter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>,</span><span> dispatch</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span><span>(</span><span>reducer</span><span>,</span><span> initialState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Content</span><span> </span><span>theme</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> App</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>That's what React Hooks are bringing on the table. All side-effects are sitting directly in the component without introducing other components as container for business logic. The container disappears and the logic just sits in React Hooks that are only functions. Even <a href="https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/commit/7867de653abbb57a49934e52622a60b433bda918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Clark left a deprecation statement in favor of React Hooks in his popular Higher-Order Component library</a>.</p><p><strong>JavaScript Class Confusion:</strong> JavaScript mixes two worlds pretty well: Object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP). React introduces many developers to both worlds. On the one side, React (and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-javascript">Redux</a>) introduced people to functional programming (FP) with function compositions, general programming concepts with functions (e.g. higher-order functions, JavaScript built-in methods like map, reduce, filter) and other terms such as immutability and side-effects. React itself didn't really introduce these things, because they are features of the language or the programming paradigm itself, but they are heavily used in React whereas <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements">every React developer becomes automatically a better JavaScript developer</a>.</p><p>On the other side, React uses JavaScript classes as one way to define React components. A class is only the declaration whereas the actual usage of the component is the instantiation of it. It creates a class instance whereas the <code>this</code> object of the class instance is used to interact with class methods (e.g. setState, forceUpdate, other custom class methods). However, classes come with a steeper learning curve for JavaScript/React beginners who are not coming from an OOP background. That's why class bindings, the <code>this</code> object and inheritance (<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which should be avoided anyway</a>) can be confusing.</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>onIncrement</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      value</span><span>:</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>onDecrement</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      value</span><span>:</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>onIncrement</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>+</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>onDecrement</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, many people argue React shouldn't take JavaScript classes away because people don't understand them. After all, they belong to the language. However, one of the hypotheses of introducing React Hooks is a smoother learning curve for React beginners when writing their React components without JavaScript classes in the first place.</p><h3 id="exercises"><a href="#exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="exercises permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Exercises:</h3><ul><li>Read more about <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component">React Function Components</a>.</li><li>Read more about <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition">Composition in React</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="whats-different-with-react-hooks"><a href="#whats-different-with-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="whats different with react hooks permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>What's different with React Hooks?</h2><p>Every time a new feature is introduced, people are concerned about it. There is one side of the group that is ecstatic about the change, and the other side that fears the change. I heard the most common concerns for React Hooks are:</p><ul><li>Everything changes! <em>Subtle panic mode ...</em></li><li>React is becoming bloated like Angular!</li><li>It's useless, classes worked fine.</li><li>It's magic!</li></ul><p>Let me address these concerns here:</p><p><strong>Everything changes:</strong> React Hooks will change how we write React applications in the future. However, at the moment, nothing changes. You can still write class components with local state and lifecycle methods and deploy advanced patterns such as Higher-Order Components or Render Prop Components. Nobody takes these learnings away from you. See how I upgraded all my open source projects from older versions to React 16.6. and none of of these projects had problems. They are using HOCs, Render Props and I believe even the old context API (correct me if am wrong). Everything I have learned all these years still works. The React team makes sure that React stays backward compatible. It will be the same with React 16.7.</p><p><span>

Now onto part two, where we check out a few more tools and libraries.</p>
<h2>Ariadne</h2>
<p><strong>Ariadne is a Python library for implementing GraphQL servers</strong> that prides itself on being schema-first. Schema-first is the approach of first defining the schema for the GraphQL service and then implementing the code by matching the definitions in the schema. The other approach is code-first where you first code the resolvers with the schema generated as an artifact. Which approach you chose is mostly up to personal preference, but let’s get back to schema-first and Ariadne and look at its features:</p>
<ul>
<li>schema-first lets both the client-side and server-side developers work at the same time since client-side developers don’t have to wait for a finished backend </li>
<li>a small and easy to learn, python based API with a focus on simplicity</li>
<li>open design, Ariadne is modular and open to customization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lighthouse</h2>
<p><strong>Lighthouse is a GraphQL framework that provides integration with Laravel (PHP) applications</strong>. It’s also schema-first and primarily uses SDL (Schema Definition Language) but also supports native PHP definitions. The idea is to take the best from both GraphQL and Laravel and combine it into a tool that makes your work much easier and provides lots of flexibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>schema-first and boilerplate free, use GraphQL SDL to describe your data and add functionality through server-side directives</li>
<li>takes full advantage of GraphQL and Laravel, build a GraphQL server on top of an existing Laravel application</li>
<li>instantly ready to use, generates optimized data queries out of the box and comes with sensible configuration defaults</li>
</ul>

<h2>GraphQL Editor</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL Editor is an all-around tool for the GraphQL schema development</strong>. The focus here is saving time and effort by visualizing schemas, creating one is as simple as joining blocks, no code required (if you prefer to create your schema the traditional way it’s still possible). This makes for a quick and easy to play with the tool, that will ease development and make communication with other team members much easier. That’s especially handy now, with everyone working via Zoom. </p>

<p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/choosing-between-rest-web-apis-and-message-streaming-8e2f4813a058" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When faced with a variety of options, how are developers building APIs supposed to know which is the right one for their solution? In this article, I’m going to outline the common characteristics for both REST APIs and message streaming so developers can better understand when (and when not) to use each one.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-rest-based-web-apis">Characteristics of REST-Based Web APIs<a href="#characteristics-of-rest-based-web-apis" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>REST-based web APIs create a conversation between a client (the API consumer) and an API server (the backend). When we build REST-based APIs within Capital One, we use HTTP as our protocol. Our designs depend heavily on HTTP, from the methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to the headers that help us communicate between client and server (e.g. Authorization, Accept, Content-Type).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-1.webp" alt="Request/response client-server list conversation"></p>

<pre><code>GET /projects
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
 [
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  ...
 ]
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-2.webp" alt="Request/response client-server create conversation"></p>

<pre><code>POST/projects
Content-Type: application/json

{ "name":"...", ... }

201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
 
 { "projectId":"...", "name":"...", ... }

</code></pre>

<p>The client (or API consumer) is the app, which sends a message (i.e. an HTTP request) to the API whenever it needs something. The server then replies with the response, including a status code that indicates if the request was processed successfully (2xx error code), failed due to client error (4xx error code), or failed due to server error (5xx error code). All communication flows from the consumer to the API backend.</p>

<p>When we add in hypermedia links, we extend the conversation with some additional information that may be helpful to the client:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-3.webp" alt="Request/response client-server hypermedia conversation"></p>

<pre><code>GET /projects/12345
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
 { 
 "name":"...", ...,
 "_links": {
   { "self" :"/projects/1234" }, 
   { "related_projects": [
     { "4567" :"/projects/4567" }, 
     { "8901" :"/projects/8901" }, 
     { "9012" :"/projects/9012" } 
   ]}, 
   { "members": [
     { "1" :"/users/1" }, 
     { "2" :"/users/2" }, 
     { "3" :"/users/3" }, 
     { "4" :"/users/4" }, 
     { "5" :"/users/5" } 
   ]}
 }
</code></pre>

<p>REST-based APIs have a specific set of characteristics that are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request/response model</strong> — API consumers send requests to an API server and receive a response.</li>
<li><strong>Pull-based interaction</strong> — API consumers send an API request when data or functionality is required (e.g. user interface, at a pre-scheduled time).</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> — API consumers receive the response after a request is sent.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple content types</strong> — since REST APIs are built upon HTTP, responses may be JSON, XML, or other content types as necessary to support consumer needs (e.g. CSV, PDF).</li>
<li><strong>Flexible interactions</strong> — Building upon the available HTTP verbs, consumers may interact with REST-based APIs through resources in a variety of ways: queries/search, creating new resources, modifying existing resources, and deleting resources. We can also build complex workflows by combining these interactions into higher-level processes.</li>
<li><strong>Caching and concurrency protocol support</strong> — HTTP has caching semantics built-in, allow for caching servers to be placed between the consumer and API server, as well as cache control of responses and eTags for concurrency control to prevent overwriting content.</li>
<li><strong>Internal and external access</strong> — REST APIs may be restricted for internal use or for external use by partners or public developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For most solutions, offering a REST-based API is a great starting point, allowing any application or automation script to interact with your API over HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-message-streaming">Characteristics of Message Streaming<a href="#characteristics-of-message-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Unlike REST APIs, message streaming is better at providing notifications when new messages arrive. Once subscribed, the client will be notified when new messages are available:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-4.webp" alt="Event-based API subscription"></p>

<pre><code>POST /subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{ "callbackUrl":"https://my.callback/path", ... }

201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
 
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the client is subscribed to a topic, it will receive notifications when new messages are available. This may be the result of a REST API processing incoming requests from a web or mobile app, then adding messages into the message stream topic to notify anyone that is interested:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-5.webp" alt="Event-based API notifications"></p>

<pre><code>POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project created event&gt;&gt;

POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project archived event&gt;&gt;

POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project updated event&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how our conversation became more interesting. We now can be notified when things change or critical business events occur; without needing to modify and redeploy the API to support a new integration that emerges in the future. This is called loose coupling, and it helps our systems be used in new ways without the originator of the messages even knowing about current and future subscribers.</p>

<p>Those familiar with message brokers will realize that this is familiar. The difference between a message broker and message streaming is that <em>message streaming allows us to revisit past messages in sequence as well</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-6.webp" alt="Streaming API conversation"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;request last 12 messages from project_messages topic&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;retrieve and send last 12 messages from project_messages topic&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This feature is useful when we need to go aggregate values or perform a new calculation we previously didn’t realize we needed.</p>

<p>Note — we can’t filter messages or perform other aggregate queries when requesting the messages — only the client can do this after requesting the messages from the topic. REST APIs are better suited for performing ad hoc queries than message streams.</p>

<p>As you are discovering, message streaming is a different style of interaction than REST-based APIs. Additional characteristics of message streaming are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Publish/subscribe model</strong> — Apps or APIs publish messages to a topic which may have zero, one, or many subscribers rather than a request/response model.</li>
<li><strong>Subscriber notification interaction</strong> — Apps receive notification when a new message is available, such as when data is modified or new data is available.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> — Unlike REST APIs, apps cannot use message streams to submit a request and receive a response back without complex coordination between parties.</li>
<li><strong>Single content-type</strong> — At Capital One, our message streaming is built upon Avro, a compact binary format useful for data serialization. Unlike HTTP, Avro doesn’t support other content types (e.g. CSV, PDF).</li>
<li><strong>Replayability</strong> — At Capital One, our message streaming is built on Kafka, subscribers may revisit and replay previous messages sequentially.</li>
<li><strong>No caching or concurrency protocol support</strong> — Message streaming doesn’t offer caching semantics, cache-control, or concurrency control between publisher and subscriber.</li>
<li><strong>Internal access only</strong> — Subscribers must be internal to the organization, unlike HTTP which may be externalized to partner or public consumers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Message streaming offers some additional communication options that REST-based APIs do not — push-based notifications when new data or state changes occur, and the option of revisiting past messages in the stream to perform new calculations or re-execute logic that failed previously. When combined together, REST-APIs enable consuming apps to integrate easily with an HTTP API, while message streaming allow consumers to be notified of changes without needing to check with the REST API first. This can be a powerful combination that can satisfy use cases that exist today, while allowing emerging use cases to be handled in the future — all without modifying existing systems to accommodate new solutions.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>As you may have realized, choosing between a web API and message streaming isn’t difficult, as long as you understand the characteristics of each one. REST APIs are best suited to request/response interactions where the client application sends a request to the API backend over HTTP. Message streaming is best suited to notification when new data or events occur that you may want to take action upon. Just be sure to match the needs of the consumer with one or more approaches to offer a robust interface to your solution’s capabilities.</p>

<p>Unlike the millions of years it takes for most mountains on Earth to form, lunar mountains crop out near instantaneously, geologically speaking.</p>



<p>Earth’s mountains primarily form when two colliding plates of the Earth’s crust lift up volumes of rock, slowly creating an elevated landform. Over millions of years, wind, water and gravity erode these uplifted sections, wearing their surface to make the mountains we are familiar with today.</p>



<p>But the Moon has no plate tectonics, atmosphere or running water. How then does it boast mountains several kilometers high? For instance, <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/03/18/mount-as-high-as-everest-zeeman-mons/">Zeeman Mons</a> on the lunar farside peaks as tall as Mount Everest.</p>



<p>The answer lies in the one of the most apparent features on the Moon – craters.</p>



<p>Most lunar craters are <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/05/27/what-does-a-fresh-crater-look-like-hell/">small and bowl-shaped</a>, formed when asteroids and comets impact the surface. This shape persists for crater sizes up to about 20 kilometers. Larger craters display more complexity.</p>



<p>The force imparted on the Moon’s surface by larger asteroids and comets, especially those with high velocities, can be tremendous. In such cases, in addition to a crater being formed, the surface in and around the impact point is compressed further. This causes the crust to melt. When the melted crust can’t be compressed any further, it bounces right back up, forming a central mountain. This process is visualized in the GIF below.</p>







<p>Most lunar mountains are formed by this highly energetic process that takes a geologically negligible passage of time. The kilometer-plus high central peaks of the young, city-sized <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/03/11/glorious-aristarchus/">Aristarchus crater</a> and 86-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/10/15/tycho-crater/">Tycho crater</a> are fine examples.</p>

<p>Aristarchus crater was one of the candidate landing sites for the now-cancelled Apollo 17+ missions. Visiting Aristarchus or Tycho in a future surface mission will allow us to study the exposed lunar interior by the virtue of their central mountains. Craters larger than these offer two central peaks.</p>



<p>The mechanics work such that for larger crater sizes or more energetic impacts, the newly formed central peak splits into two before it can solidify. The 93-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/04/08/a-peak-inside-the-moon-with-copernicus/">Copernicus</a> and 77-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/01/21/y-shaped-mountains-in-king-crater/">King</a> craters respectively host two distinct peaks, each towering more than six kilometers!</p>











<p>Apart from allowing scientists to study the lunar interior, such places are key to understanding mechanics of impacts that form such features, found not just on the Moon but across the Solar System.</p>



<h3>Put a ring on it </h3>



<p>For even larger craters, the twin peaks widen into a ring of mountains, like a liquid drop causing a ripple on still water. The 312-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/06/10/the-crowned-crater-of-schrodinger/">crater of Schrödinger</a> on the Moon’s farside is a well preserved example, despite being almost four billion years old.</p>







<p>A <a href="https://earthandsolarsystem.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/new-paper-a-robotic-mission-concept-to-return-samples-from-the-schrodinger-basin/">mission to Schrödinger</a> can help solve fundamental mysteries about the Moon’s evolution, like if the Moon indeed had a global magma ocean–a hypothesis tied to <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">its origin</a>. Further, Schrödinger lies inside the Moon’s largest impact crater, the 2,500-kilometer-wide South Pole-Aitken basin. The impact that created the basin excavated deep into the lunar crust, and perhaps even the mantle. Since Schrödinger formed later, its impact could’ve penetrated deeper and uplifted more materials, offering insights–literally and figuratively–into the lunar interior.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">Chicxulub crater</a> on Earth, linked to the extinction of dinosaurs, is also thought to have formed as a ringed crater, but wore down of its original form due to Earth’s active weathering. As such, Schrödinger offers an analog to better understand Chicxulub.</p>



<p>For crater sizes beyond 500 kilometers, you get not one but multiple rings of mountains. The 930-kilometer-wide ancient crater of <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/01/07/outstanding-orientale-multi-ring-basin-on-the-moon/">Orientale</a> on the Moon’s farside boasts three mountain rings, most of which is preserved.</p>







<p>Missions to both Schrödinger and Orientale can tell us exactly when did large asteroids and comets excessively bombard bodies in the Solar System. This period of blistering impacts is particularly important as Earth is thought to have gotten its water during this time.</p>



<p>For some ancient craters, like Imbrium on Moon’s nearside, only parts of the outermost mountain ring are visible today. The rest of the interior has been drowned in lava, which you see as dark regions on the Moon. The prominent, arc-shaped mountain range of <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/10/08/the-mountain-range-montes-apenninus/">Montes Apenninus</a>, forming Imbrium’s southeast border, stretches 600 kilometers long.</p>







<p>Multi-ring impact basins exist on many other worlds in the Solar System, like <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/9780640jpg">Caloris</a> on Mercury, <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/20130614_g8gsrngbas01">an unnamed basin</a> on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dione_-_Evander_basin.jpg">Evander</a> on Saturn’s moon Dione, and more. Jupiter’s moon Callisto boasts the largest multi-ring basin of the solar system, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_(crater)">Valhalla</a>, spanning 3800 kilometers wide.</p>







<p>The ubiquity of mountains formed by impacts across the Solar System and their consistent patterns indicate common geological mechanisms. And the Moon being so close to us presents us with an opportunity to study these fundamental processes in planetary science.</p>

<h3>Exploring the mountains</h3>



<p>Moon orbiters use remote sensing techniques to understand the composition of the lunar mountains. But to better understand the composition, structure and origin, surface missions are needed, especially sample return ones to determine precise ages. To that end, NASA had selected several of the above mentioned places as <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/leag2009/presentations/Day-2%20PM/03-35_Gruener.pdf">candidate landing sites</a> for the now cancelled Constellation program to return humans to the Moon.</p>



<p>However, sending landing and roving missions to lunar mountains is a bit of an engineering hurdle. Most surface missions of the past landed in the dark lunar plains – vast, solidified lava regions that provide a relatively uniform surface for spacecraft to land on. The rocky nature of the mountainous regions make it more difficult to safely touch down on. However, things may change with NASA’s upcoming Artemis missions.</p>



<p>The Artemis program aims to explore the lunar poles in this decade, both <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services-overview">robotically</a> and with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-companies-to-develop-human-landers-for-artemis-moon-missions">humans</a>. This requires developing precision landing technologies for safe descent on the challenging polar terrain, as a result also enabling surface missions to the lunar mountains. But there is a type of mountain that spacecraft can visit even with present-day technologies.</p>



<p>The Moon has experienced several distinct periods of volcanism in the last four billion years. Lava slowly oozing out of openings on the surface during such times have formed <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/11/05/unique-volcanic-domes-of-gruithuisen/">volcanic domes</a>. These domes aren’t as tall as the impact-created mountains and have gentle slopes. China’s third Moon landing mission, Chang’e 5, launching end of 2020 is targeting the largest such lunar dome, Mons Rümker.</p>







<p>The 70-kilometer-wide Mons Rümker is thought to have formed less than two billion years ago. The Chang’e 5 mission aims to bring back samples from the dome and determine its exact age. Since scientists use the Moon to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0401-the-lunar-chronology">calibrate the timing</a> of events across bodies in the Solar System, analysis of Chang’e 5 samples would be an invaluable addition to happenings in the geologically recent past.</p>



<p>Mountains on the Moon are a marvel that give us a peak (pun intended) into the lunar interior, help discern the chain of events in the Solar System’s evolution and improve our understanding of the physical processes that shape airless worlds everywhere.</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

Revolver Exclusive Study: COVID-19 Lockdowns Over 10 Times More Deadly Than Pandemic Itself </p><div>

<p>A groundbreaking new study commissioned by <em>Revolver News</em> concludes that COVID-19 lockdowns are ten times more deadly than the actual COVID-19 virus in terms of years of life lost by American citizens.</p>
<p>Up until this point there had been no simple, rigorous analysis that accurately and definitively conveys the true costs of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Accordingly, <em>Revolver News</em> set out to commission a study to do precisely that: to finally quantify the net damage of the lockdowns in terms of a metric known as “life-years.” Simply put, we have drawn upon existing economic studies on the health effects of unemployment to calculate an estimate of how many years of life will have been lost due to the lockdowns in the United States, and have weighed this against an estimate of how many years of life will have been saved by the lockdowns. <strong>The results are nothing short of staggering, and suggest that the lockdowns will end up costing Americans over 10 times as many years of life as they will save from the virus itself.</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 lockdown measures that Americans have had to endure for the greater part of 2020 represent one of the most dramatic, consequential, and damaging policy measures undertaken in this nation’s history. <strong>For the first time in its history, America has experienced a situation so crippling and perilous that long term financial and social stability have been legitimately threatened.</strong></p>
<p>As with everything in 2020 America, these lockdown measures have become deeply politicized. President Trump opposes further devastating lockdowns. In his recent Republican National Convention speech, President Trump raised the point that lockdowns have had very real and very devastating effects on the lives of many Americans.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Trump: “The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. &nbsp;Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it’s a surrender to the virus.” <strong><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974">[Politico]</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden, by contrast, has suggested that he is willing to impose further lockdowns if “scientists” tell him to do so. It is unclear which scientists Joe Biden would be listening to, as there is no consensus among scientists and experts as to whether or not lockdowns are worth the staggering costs they impose on the common man.</p>

<p><em>Revolver News </em>is very proud to present a rigorous study on such an important topic and we hope that this will be spread far and wide both within government and without to assist policymakers. This exclusive study is a collaborative guest contribution to <em>Revolver News</em>. Due to the unfortunately politicized nature of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the associated plausibility of professional repercussions, the authors have chosen for the time being to represent themselves pseudonymously.</p>

<p><strong>CHEAT SHEET</strong>: <strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard approaches to evaluating epidemic policy responses, involving the <em>Value of a Statistical Life</em>, have conceptual problems and are biased towards the elderly and rich.</li>
<li>Using a life-years criterion as an alternative shows that the lockdowns cost <strong>an order of magnitude more</strong> life-years than they saved.</li>
<li>Most of the publicized cost-benefit analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have used coarse measures like lives as units rather than life-years, which misleads politicians and the general public. COVID-19 deaths disproportionately impact the oldest members of the population, whereas the economic impacts of lockdowns disproportionately harm the youngest of the working population, who have far greater life expectancies at the time of impact.</li>
<li>Using prior research on workforce entrants and recent graduates entering into a market marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates of life-years lost can be determined. Extensive research on job displacement can be used to estimate the economic impact in life-years of starkly increased unemployment for mid-to-late career workers.</li>
<li><strong>Combining these analyses, we found that an estimated 18.7 million life-years will be lost in the United States due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Comparative data analysis between nations shows that the lockdowns in the United States likely had a minimal effect in saving life-years. Using two different comparison groups, we estimate that the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved between a quarter to three quarters of a million life-years.</strong></li>
<li>Every broad age category lost life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and older.</li>
<li>The media and state and local governments contributed to the panic by selectively presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of dubious benefit.</li>
<li>Public health researchers and health economists gave poor policy advice and made selective use of the prior research literature. They will likely be rewarded, not punished, by academia for their failure because of academia’s biases.</li>
<li>Public health in general is so biased and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it is not “not yet ready for policy analysis.”</li>
</ul>
<p>———————————</p>
<p><strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the following weeks, the countries of the world began implementing previously unthinkable measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the United States, some states quickly locked down nearly all physical businesses, venues, and public areas. As a short quarantine rapidly grew into an indefinite lockdown, some lawmakers and economists began asking if the lockdowns would cause more damage than the virus itself. Using empirical research, first-pass estimates can be made about the impact of the unprecedented lockdown in life-years lost. This can then be compared to the number to the estimated life-years lost to COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Why life-years? It is well-known that socioeconomic status (SES) appears to be linked to life expectancy and some of that association is causal, with higher SESes causing longer life expectancies through a number of channels. Most government policy analysts make decisions using the <em>Value of a Statistical Life (VSLs) —</em> which is about $10 million. If a regulation can save 1 life and costs $9 million, for instance, then it’s worth imposing to save a life. If it costs $11 million, then it’s not worth imposing to save a life. A problem with this approach is how coarse it is. Because SES is linked to life expectancies, actions by the government that do not result in direct loss of life are liable to being simply unaccounted for in this approach. For example, why not set the VSL at $100 million? Or $1? If you set the VSL too low, you will fail to impose many very cheap lifesaving regulations.<strong> Something perhaps more subtle is that if you set the VSL too high, then regulations you impose will reduce income so much by retarding economic activity that you will wind up reducing life expectancies through the SES-life expectancy channel.</strong> There are actually more fundamental issues with the use of a single VSL for all citizens (see Sunstein’s <em>Valuing Life</em> for a good overview), but many find the general equilibrium problems with it very intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, the COVID-19 conversation among public health analysts, bio-statisticians, economists, and policymakers <em>who are otherwise sensitive to the problems with VSL</em> has been dominated by the standard “coarse” VSL calculation above.</strong> We have seen no full policy analyses utilizing life-year approaches, although various studies have tried to estimate the average life-year losses per COVID-19 death. Controversy over estimating the correct value of a statistical life, problems with actually applying it in analysis as described above, and perhaps a certain odiousness associated with the rendering of human lives in dollar terms have pushed some health economists and public health analysts toward use of a life-years approach. This approach is simple, and in principle, involves no explicit conversion of human lives into money terms — although such a trade-off is implicit in any policy analysis. From the life-years’ perspective, a policymaker can compute the life-years lost and gained if they take a specific action. <strong>For instance, a new airline safety regulation may make users of airlines so safe that they save an average of 0.1 life-years per traveler, but the higher cost of air travel may induce potential passengers to switch to less safe car travel, costing the switchers an average of 0.3 life-years. If enough people switch to car travel, then the airline safety regulation will actually reduce the total life-years lived from the perspective of the transportation system as a whole.</strong></p>
<p>A life-year maximizer would say that the regulation should not be adopted. <strong>An advantage of the life-year approach is that it values all people’s life-years equally in principle. The life-year of an 80 year old is of equal value to that of a 20 year old.</strong> <strong>The …</strong></p></div></div></div>

        <p>Batteries comprise 30-40% of the upfront cost. To push electric mobility, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MORTH) of India, announced that all the states and union territories (UTs) <strong>have now been allowed the registration and sale of electric vehicles (EVs) without pre-fitted batteries</strong>.<br>
The move is likely to provide the necessary boost for the<strong> wider adoption of EVs across the country.</strong><br>
Practically, the government is striving to create an ecosystem to accelerate the uptake of electric mobility in the country. This will not only protect the environment and reduce the oil imports but also provide opportunities to the sunrise industry.<br>
What is the situation in India? According to the <a href="https://www.smev.in/"><strong>Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles</strong></a>, the sale of electric vehicles in this country increased by 20% in 2019-20, mainly driven by rising sales of two-wheelers.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentBody"><p>While working on a completely different project, I started to ask myself how the <code>who</code> command was working under the hood. In the end, I thought it was a good topic for a blog post.</p><h2 id="who-is-who">Who is <code>who</code></h2><p>Let’s start with the basics. the <code>who</code> command allows you to list the users currently logged on the system.
For example, on my machine:</p><pre><code>$ who
gauthier tty2         2020-08-30 15:06 (tty2)
gauthier pts/1        2020-08-30 15:06 (tmux(1555).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-30 16:41 (tmux(1555).%6)
gauthier pts/4        2020-08-30 15:57 (tmux(1555).%3)
</code></pre><p>It tells me that I am logged on the “physical” terminal <code>tty2</code> and on three pseudo terminals. Indeed my current session of Gnome Shell is running on <code>tty2</code> and I have 3 <code>tmux</code> windows open.</p><p>But where is it getting those information? Probably from a file as everything is a file with Linux, but let’s check which one and how the data is stored there.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-reverse-engineering">A bit of reverse engineering</h2><p>In order to see what the <code>who</code> command is doing I could try to find the source code and dig into it. But I found it fun to use <code>strace</code> to check what the process was doing instead. Since we are expecting <code>who</code> to read system files, we can only focus on the <code>open</code> syscalls.</p><pre><code>$ strace who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
</code></pre><p>We can quickly filter what is interesting and what is not. The first files two files <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code>, <code>/usr/lib/libc.so.6</code> are shared libraries loaded by the process, those are interesting us.</p><p>Then <code>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</code>, <code>/var/run/utmp</code> and <code>/etc/localtime</code> are opened. Let’s see what those files are storing.</p><p>When exploring this kind of topics, it is always interesting to first search into the man pages before starting browsing the web. The 5th section of the manual is dedicated to “file formats and conventions” and seems a good place to start.</p><h3 id="locale-archive">locale-archive</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>locale(5)</code> where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  locale  definition file contains all the information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into the binary locale data‐base.
</code></pre><p>The page also sends us to <code>locale(7)</code> for more explanation about those informations:</p><pre><code>A  locale is a set of language and cultural rules. These cover aspects such as language for messages, different character sets, lexico‐graphic conventions, and so on. A program needs to be able to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.
</code></pre><p>So the <code>who</code> command read from this file, probably using the <code>setlocale(3)</code> function, to find out how the information should be formated and displayed.</p><p>We can actually check it:</p><pre><code>$ LC_ALL='fr_FR.utf8' who
gauthier tty2         Sep  2 11:38 (:1)
gauthier pts/1        Sep  2 12:11 (tmux(2445).%0)
gauthier pts/2        Sep  2 12:37 (tmux(2445).%1)
gauthier pts/3        Sep  2 13:04 (tmux(2445).%2)
</code></pre><p>Indeed, the date is is not formated the same way!</p><h3 id="localtime">localtime</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/etc/localtime'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>localtime(5)</code> which explains:</p><pre><code>The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the local system that is used by applications for presentation to the user.
</code></pre><p>Probably <code>who</code> uses this file (or uses a function that is using this file) to print timestamps (columns 4 and 5 of <code>who</code>'s output) using the correct timezone configured by the user.</p><h3 id="utmp">utmp</h3><p>Finally comes <code>/var/run/utmp</code>:</p><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/var/run/utmp'
/usr/share/man/man5/utmp.5.gz
</code></pre><p>Where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  utmp  file  allows  one to discover information about who is currently using the system.  There may be more users currently using the system, because not all programs use utmp logging.
</code></pre><p>Great! We found where the <code>who</code> command is getting its data. It would be nice to be able to read this file to get those data without using the <code>who</code> command. Unfortunately:</p><pre><code>The file is a sequence of utmp structures, declared as follows in &lt;utmp.h&gt; (note that this is only one of several definitions around; details depend on the version of libc):
</code></pre><p>At this point we understood what the <code>who</code> command is doing: it is reading <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, parsing the content and formating it nicely. Let’s see if we can reproduce this simple behavior.</p><h3 id="my-own-who">My own <code>who</code></h3><p>What we simply need to do is: open <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, read <code>n</code> bytes (where <code>n</code> is the size of the <code>utmp</code> structure), print the info contained in each structure, continue until we reach the end of the file. With a bit of formating, we can even make it look like the original <code>who</code> command.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;utmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;locale.h&gt;

int main() {
  // set the right locale to display the information nicely
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

  // open the file
  FILE * file= fopen("/var/run/utmp", "rb");

  // just for safety
  if (file == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  // initialize the utmp structure
  struct utmp entry;

  // read the entries from the file one by one
  while (fread(&amp;entry, sizeof(struct utmp), 1, file) != 0) {
    if (entry.ut_type != USER_PROCESS)
      continue;

    // format the date (remember who uses the /etc/localtime?)
    char date[80];
    time_t raw_time = entry.ut_tv.tv_sec;
    struct tm *ts = localtime(&amp;raw_time);
    strftime(date, sizeof(date), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M", ts);

    // print the output for this entry, tries to mock who's output
    printf("%-8s %-12s %s (%s)\n", entry.ut_user, entry.ut_line, date, entry.ut_host);
  }

  fclose(file);
}

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name. Now I can try to migrate this knowledge to integrate this to microk8s local setup.</p><h2 id="integrating-let-s-encrypt-with-dns-challenge-into-microk8s-setup-using-cert-manager">Integrating Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge into microk8s setup using <code>cert-manager</code></h2><p>I am not going to describe microk8s Kubernetes setup as it is pretty straightforward compared to the plain Kubernetes setup.</p><p>The first step is to install <code>cert-manager</code> I will be using Helm to install it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now let's configure Certificate Issuer.

(I had to change kind from <code>Issuer</code> to <code>ClusterIssuer</code> because of namespace issues)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that we configured everything we should use the SSL certificate somewhere for this article I will configure microk8s ingress to allow access to <code>kubernetes-dashboard</code> via <code>https://server.techprowd.com/dashboard</code></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now after applying the resources we can check if our certificate resource was created and check if our Let's Encrypt Certificate was created too</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that everything created we should be able to access <code>https://server.techprowd.com/dashboard</code></p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-6.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png 1135w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If I understood correctly the Certificate will be automatically renewed when expiration time comes up.</p><p>So that's all for this article. I hope this helped other people who had similar ideas like me when started working with Kubernetes.</p><p>P.S. I am not a professional Kubernetes engineer and everything mentioned in this article is just my assumptions and trying out practices in the local environment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>All forms of signing email are generally solving the wrong problem (a thesis)</h2>

	<p><small>August 30, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Modern email is full of forms of signed email. Personally signed
email is the old fashioned approach (and wrong), but modern email
on the Internet is laced with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a>, which
have the sending system sign it to identify at least who sent it.
Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the more I feel that
signed email is generally solving the wrong problem (and if it's
solving the right one, we won't like that solution in the long run).</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols">why email often isn't as good as modern
protocols</a>, which is because it's what I
described as an <em>anonymous push</em> protocol. An anonymous push protocol
necessarily enables spam since it allows anyone to send you things.
Describing email as 'anonymous push' makes it sound like the anonymity
is the problem, which would make various forms of signing the
solution (including DKIM). But this isn't really what you care about
with email and requiring email to carry some strong identification
doesn't solve the problem, as we've found out with all of the spam
email that has perfectly good DKIM signatures for some random new
domain.</p>

<p>(This is a version of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TwoSidesOfIdentity">the two sides of identity</a>.
On the Internet people can trivially have multiple identities, so
while an identity is useful to only let selected people in, it's
not useful to keep someone out.)</p>

<p>I think that what you really care about with modern communication
protocols is <em>revocable authorization</em>. With a pull protocol, you
have this directly; you tacitly revoke authorization by stopping
pulling from the place you no longer like. With a push protocol,
you can still require authorization that you grant, which lets you
revoke that granted authorization if you wish. The closest email
comes to this is having lots of customized email addresses and
carefully using a different one for each service (which Apple has
recently automated for iOS people).</p>

<p>Obviously, requiring authorization to push things to you has a
fundamental conflict with any system that's designed to let arbitrary
strangers contact you without prearrangement (which is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/FundamentalSpamProblem">the
fundamental problem of spam</a>).
Modern protocols seem to deal with this in two ways (even with
revocable authorization); they have some form of gatekeeping (in
the form of accounts or access), and then they evolve to provide
settings that let you stop or minimize the ability of arbitrary
strangers to contact you (for example, Twitter's settings around
who can send you Direct Messages).</p>

<p>(The modern user experience of things like Twitter has also evolved
to somewhat minimize the impact of strangers trying to contact you;
for example, the Twitter website separates new DMs from strangers
from DMs from people you've already interacted with. It's possible
that email clients could learn some lessons from this, for example
by splitting your inbox into 'people and places you've interacted
with before' and 'new contacts from strange people'. This would
make DKIM signatures and other email source identification useful,
apart from the bit where senders today feel free to keep changing
where they're sending from.)</p>

<p>PS: In this view, actions like blocking or muting people on Twitter
(or the social network of your choice) is a form of revoking their
tacit authorization to push things to you.</p>

<p>I regularly help pre-seed entrepreneurs identify and evaluate potential startup opportunities. The following is a set of heuristics I’ve developed and collected over the years that might of use.</p>



<p>These heuristics are just a starting point to <strong>identify interesting, unsolved problems</strong> in the world that may turn in to great startups. Entrepreneurs must still go deep on understanding their customers, the business model, have a clear answer to <a href="https://avichal.com/2017/11/27/why-now/">Why Now?</a> there is a big shift in the market, and <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">focus on identifying problems rather than generating ideas that <em>sound</em> good.</a></p>



<ol><li>Tools inside a big company — High growth companies often first experience a problem other companies will soon face and solve it internally. Bringing these tools to everyone else can work well, e.g. Asana was inspired by the Facebook internal tasks tool, Cloudera was inspired by Facebook’s internal data infrastructure. </li><li>Consumer generation shift — Think about a consumer company that started ~7 years ago. Generations shift in about 7-10 years, thus tastes evolve, and platforms shift. Thus there is an opening to acquire customers, e.g. Snapchat started 2011 while Facebook started 2004</li><li>Big company acquisitions — If a company is acquired for $5B+, consider a competitor. This may indicate product maturity, a departure of talent after earnouts, or becoming focused on profits vs. product investment. Now may be a great time to re-imaginge LinkedIn or Github</li><li>Market validation from other startups — Find a company that recently raised a series A and approach solving the problem differently. Often the first company to identify an opportunity will not win but does indicate customers have a real problem they want solved.</li><li>Revisit ideas that were too early — Look back at ideas that were hot 10 years ago because entrepreneurs have a tendency to be too early. See if any might make sense now, e.g. Instacart vs. Webvan.</li><li>Invert a successful company’s core competency — Take the core strength of a company and flip it on its head to see what a product experience may be if you did the opposite, e.g. Snapchat was based on ephemerality and Facebook based on permanence of identity, or Southwest was based on a point-to-point model with only one type of plane whereas other airlines use a hub and spoke model with multiple types of planes.</li><li>Extend consumer behaviors to businesses — Take a product used by consumers and think about how it might apply to prosumers, enterprises, and small businesses, e.g. LinkedIn vs Facebook.</li><li>Turn open source projects in to SAAS businesses — Find open source projects that are very popular and turn these in to out of the box services for enterprises, e.g. PagerDuty is like Nagios.</li><li>Compete with old world industries using software — Find an industry that is resistant to using software and build a vertically integrated version to compete with that industry, e.g. Atrium vs. law firms.</li><li>Low NPS, fragmented industries — Identify a large, a highly-fragmented industry with terrible net-promoter-score and build a modern, software-first version of their product, e.g. OpenDoor (credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois">Keith Rabois</a> for this one) </li><li>Make things programmable — Take a desktop utility, move it online, and make it more powerful by making it more programmable, e.g. Airtable and Notion (similar to <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/01/interesting-markets-2019-edition.html">Elad Gil’s idea around devsumers</a>)</li><li>Unbundle a company — Look at the functions of modern companies and unbundle them to make them available for companies of all sizes, e.g. WeWork is the unbundled facilities group at most big companies</li><li>Look to engineers’ hobbies — Figure out where hobbyist engineers are spending their spare time and how to productize that (<a href="http://cdixon.org/2013/03/03/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years/">Chris Dixon’s idea</a>)</li><li>Understand how teens communicate — Figure out where teenagers are spending their time to see what the communication products of the next decade may be. Teens are unencumbered and very creative, so seek to understand the motivations instead of judge.</li><li>Travel and observe non-software solutions — Travel to new places to discover non-software solutions that other countries/people/markets have come up with to various problems, e.g. I was in Moscow in 2006 and people could just hail any stranger on the street to drive them somewhere like a cab. It may not have been a big leap if you saw this behavior to Uber/Lyft on your phone.</li><li>Look at behaviors in certain geographies — Smaller, homogenous culture countries (Sweden, Korea, Japan) are early adopters of many technologies. Spend time there to understand what they are doing that isn’t globally popular yet, e.g. watching other people play video games or mobile payments took off in these markets very early relative to the US.</li><li>Unbundle the government — Think about what services the government offers and how you might build a profitable business model around these, perhaps even by offering these services in a more cost-effective way back to the government, e.g. SpaceX is a private NASA, FedEx is a private postal service.</li><li>Verticalize an already successful business — Find a massively successful business such as Salesforce and target it for a vertical that is traditionally challenging to access, e.g. Veeva is a pharma industry specific CRM worth $15B+ and raised only $7M in funding.</li><li>Build something for a distribution channel — Identify a new distribution channel that would enable access to a new customer, and then think through what that customer wants that the distribution channel does not want to provide, e.g. Pinterest and Yelp built on SEO, Paypal built on eBay, YouTube embedded inside MySpace before MySpace had a video product.</li><li>Draft on a regulatory shift — Build behind a big regulatory shift to compete with large incumbents who will be slow to move and have regulatory + technical baggage, e.g. Oscar Health after Obamacare. I’m sure some companies will spin up to help people transition to a post-GDPR world.</li></ol>



<p>I’m sure there are other good heuristics to use as a starting point. If anyone sends me others, I’ll add them to my blog post as a reference for others.</p>

		<p>I love my two cats dearly and they bring a lot of joy to my life, but they also bring other things, like poop, and fur.&nbsp; When I tried to research mitigations for any of these it was 100% SEO listicles, so I’m sharing my raw data in the hopes that the next person can find something real-if-incomplete instead of a list of every automated litter box that has ever been manufactured.</p>
<p>I wrote the bulk of this in February, but then one of the cats developed dermatitis and I put it on pause until I could make sure it wasn’t caused by anything on this list. Alas, it wasn’t, she’s just allergic to my new apartment. But then I wanted to test something else, and suddenly six months had passed. So if the tenses seem weird, that’s why.</p>
<p>(Links are affiliate links when possible)</p>

<p>I screwed up choosing my new apartment (this was written before the allergy thing). I remembered to check for space to put the litter box in the bathroom, but in my joy at finding a place that allowed that at all after so many that did not,&nbsp; I forgot to check if that space was also where you stood to wash your hands. So I ended up having to put the box in the living room. I’ve done that before and didn’t want to go back to having to keep the window open year round and still smelling poop. I also didn’t love the aesthetic.&nbsp; So I set up something kind of elaborate.</p>
<h2><a href="https://kittyvent.com/products/kitty-vent">KittyVent Litter Box Ventilator</a></h2>
<p>This is a long piece of hosing with a gentle fan in it, and a plastic thingy to block off a window that has a hole for the hose to connect to (similar to what you’d use for a portable air conditioner)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2969/4434/products/IMG_0842_075fb887-2c88-400b-9bc8-3973573e3915_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1545953794" width="423" height="282"></p>
<p>The window-blocking thing works vertically but won’t stay up on its own, I had to tape it. The fan is extremely quiet, you can’t tell it’s on from more than six inches away. I’m very sure it works because the first time I noticed a smell, I found the fan had been turned off.</p>
<p>There are instructions for how to DIY this available online (e.g. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Cat-Litter-Box-Odor-Eliminator-Fan-FlowCat/">here</a>), but I just bought it and it worked fine.</p>
<h2>Litterbox Holding End Table</h2>
<p>To make it less hideous, I got an end table designed to hold a litter box. Amazon is full of these, but most have only a single entrance and no ventilation. I assume these are aimed at people who haven’t thought things through. I wanted something I could connect a vent to and actually get rid of the smell. You might be able to cut a hole in one of the ventless ones to attach the hose to but I didn’t feel like bothering, so I got one with ventilation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iP7ZrigoL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="443" height="420"></p>
<p>I chose ecoFlex (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BM8E4KK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BM8E4KK&amp;linkId=12a658675d21d4d4f9cad298d5ba2314">affiliate link</a>)&nbsp; because matched my it existing furniture and was the only option with both ventilation holes and a second shelf. For this, I accepted it being really much larger than it needed to be. Also the copytext said something about liquid-proof, non-smell-absorbant material, although who knows how true that is. Then I packing taped the ventilation hose to a hole in the back that wasn’t shown in the pictures, apparently intended for electric cords to automated litter boxes.</p>
<p>My cats adapted stupidly well to this- when I set up the litter box with the door open, they both used it within 10 minutes, despite their other litter box still being available. They did just as well when I closed the door.</p>
<p>Some litter does escape the table, so have a plan for that.</p>
<h2>Dog Poop Bags</h2>
<p>My weird conservation instincts push me not to empty the litter box until I can fill a bag. Otherwise I’m wasting valuable bag. So I bought a bunch of very small, very cheap bags and stored them in that shelf in the litter box end table, which is why I wanted it so much. I chose Amazon Basics Dog Poop Bags (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NABTGY2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NABTGY2&amp;linkId=4d1641dea9b445b48539e119879ecada">affiliate link</a>) based on WireCutter’s <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dog-poop-bags/">recommendation</a> and so far they are resoundingly fine.</p>
<h2>Dr Esley Cat Litter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9WFY14/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07L9WFY14&amp;linkId=37e0a6f0fb2ce49f0ba47c52c36791d7">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I got this because Sweethome recommended it. I didn’t appreciate how much better it was working until a delivery screw up made me use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZYMWVT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06ZZYMWVT&amp;linkId=e9f8cccc7ed36fc1765011ac565da4d4">Arm and Hammer</a> and there started to be a smell where there hadn’t been before.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-3.html">Litter Robot 3</a></h2>
<p>This is so close to being a truly great product, but isn’t quite reliable enough to be the only litter box. It had a tendency to get stuck in an unusable position, which eventually forces the cats to go elsewhere. The drawer the poop stays in doesn’t completely contain the smell. Also the range of litter between “excess will get dumped” and “too low” is uncomfortably thin. I’d still recommend it as a second litter box to cut down on scooping, or in a populous household where there will always be someone to turn it off and on again.</p>
<h2>Two Layer Litter Mat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G67FD6W/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00G67FD6W&amp;linkId=9e1bbec26c9a003b834013f6cbb1bc7d">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BjAf-AA6L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"></p>
<p>This actually worked great at its stated purpose of catching litter the cats track out of the box, but when the cats pooped on it (say, because the litter box had been upside down for six hours), it was almost impossible to clean, especially if I caught it less than instantly. Plus it is ugly.</p>
<h2>Open Window with a Fan</h2>
<p>This was definitely better than not having an open window with a fan, but there’s no comparison between it and the vent-with-hose.</p>


<h2>Silicone Grooming Gloves (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9KSITZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9KSITZ&amp;linkId=cf4e5b0147e03c93e42da573c5afaf32">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713JHXyZS9L._AC_SL1000_.jpg" width="356" height="321"></p>
<p>These collect a lot of hair, plus their squishiness means you can brush bony areas that would be a problem for a metal comb. The cats start purring the instant I pet them with these.</p>
<p>Downside: kind of a pain to get the hair off the glove, does not pick up 100% of the fur it loosens, so be sure to use it somewhere easy to vacuum or at least not your own lap.</p>

<h2>The Dryer</h2>
<p>Turns out dryers are reasonably good at removing cat hair if you wait long enough. Remember to clean the lint trap frequently.</p>
<h2>Reusable Lint Roller</h2>
<p>I tried two made of the same material- a paddle shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBM761G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07SBM761G&amp;linkId=94a8f23a77ace6722af2df51d72f696b">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dh0-dIIwL._SL1467_.jpg" width="341" height="324"></p>
<p>and a more traditional roller shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BAGTNAQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00BAGTNAQ&amp;linkId=cb9987743b51a7b5feea72739bf6ac92">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VbLSzuCrL._SL1500_.jpg" width="340" height="272"></p>
<p>Of these, I found the wand shaped one easier to use, and the roller easier to clean. I prioritized use, but your mileage may vary. Also, you need to actually read the instructions on how to use it, running it back and forth like disposable lint roller just redistributes the hair.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a pillow after I ran the paddle shaped one over part of it several times. I think this gives a good idea of what it’s capable of, i.e. it’s a significant improvement but doesn’t get everything.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CdwlDpVYOYR7uoDoi2G-hNc8DLvvdJcuKTEiekukqxS_Ao3h9i5dMpu5j-s6GWrwGTe-34ILa7rc-Y83frrUc5SpqWEqErREaYHV8QACkzN1Qc7ziND_ZkQ7bPRcB2J6jcr9cxcOWwBpDKwT-zVo5dalEK1QTcm5cntNpZpe213JKFvj0cH-3aSXp9gjvW_yvmj_PRXNWBOEbkCwYiz_sVkrhebNvKv48qHgcu0hq7P-cW5DGbFncCoHJYGk0hn5zUSJGTfBZycsdWoq9wwXV3fepvtl8koVwGgAZTu-eGAifmoPK1RIQurOfZd8aYCANtifgD21PKFn0UTrFUx6gJ1paCdQ2uEVuYunpuxPVALjhQddhCI74D525eMhQ2b7-pj7q74Q9s-DI1_DHsmdvxwlGAzbPKowjkgj_XCi3kcq6MgV4ApNaZvSE89ZV3dok7peQEkh3WdP6p_V5WZbTMLdxwSqrUWU2gWNgt5R9Su6mxnSad_vpkMcSmCmln5j5aLfC0hBCOPWtYBiZ20pr0x9q2atPvG6kUhElanjCNtJBYvsgewnqxSCbzqB0tcfJ3UNFuETuFCgQ_kSU_5JMMeqa2oi94i1GH2Gogjm9wMKO3iruENNYaRmHW-9ogCsfvOHPPP558lJu78AOFY3Ld2zEjEfijgu22QP1U3vxkZBFGR_fKbfkvI=w1760-h1320-no" width="340" height="255"></p>
<p>Note: inbetween writing this and publishing, the paddle brush people offered me actual money to publish a review, which I plan on taking them up on, assuming I can find the form.</p>
<h2>Shark Pet-Perfect II Handheld Vacuum (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037HHFMO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0037HHFMO&amp;linkId=4140bcc636b3132e9c69552f56ebb21e">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>Sweethome’s top handheld vacuum pick was sold out everywhere and their second is specifically called out as being bad at fur, so I selected based on Amazon reviews. As a vacuum cleaner it is Not Fucking Around- it is super powerful and sucks anything off my floors. It advertises a special whirling brush aimed specifically at pet hair, but I found it choked on soft surface I tried it on, and the bristles were better. The biggest complain on Amazon was the battery life, but I got it for spot cleaning not marathons, so it’s been fine and I appreciate not paying for a feature I don’t use.</p>
<p>All of the anti-cat-hair devices work better if I stay very on top of them. Given time, the fur works itself deeper into the fabric and nothing will work except picking it out with actual human fingers.</p>

<h2>The Furminator (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MZLNVSW/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MZLNVSW&amp;linkId=ea4961e2a9d1ed7f9540a55d8364f886">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>This is another one that was great at its official objective but failed a secret objective. It was absolutely amazing at removing fur from the cats (on areas broad and unbony enough to support the comb), and they liked it, but it left them less soft. I did not get these cats to have them at less than their maximum softness.</p>
<h2><span>Rubber Thingies You Throw in the Washer and Dryer&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uRMoJP33L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="402" height="402"></p>
<p>I ran an experiment and as far as I can tell these are no better than just running an article through the dryer. Before/after photos (which I unfortunately didn’t save) didn’t show more hair being removed and the thingies are completely free of hair after many uses, which suggests to me they’re not helping much.</p>
<p>I tried wetting them and running them over a pillow case and they indeed picked up something, so I’m leaving them in my washer just in case.</p>
<p>I used LEADTEAM (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THZ68TT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07THZ68TT&amp;linkId=8efe81ab9e97d47fa558f5f04ff3d1f9">affiliate link</a>) and didn’t test any others, they looked identical.</p>
<h2>Wool Dryer Balls (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S0U2NVG/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00S0U2NVG&amp;linkId=6ab6affdfd3d806f607cc564889f6bbf">affiliate link</a>)</h2>

<p>Testing the dryer inserts is difficult because it’s really hard to get a control group. I can’t put in half a blanket and see what the other half does. I can’t even use my two identical blankets, because they’re not guaranteed to have identical amounts of hair on them. I tried with socks but was kind of out of patience by that point. I was pretty confident the rubber ones were doing nothing, but despite a really silly amount of rigor involving photos and test swabs with the lint roller, I just can’t tell with these.</p>
<h2>Disposable Lint Rollers</h2>
<p>These were better than nothing but not as good as the reusable roller.</p>

<p>My cats were never great at eating but had gotten to the point where between the two of them someone was vomiting almost every day without cause (cause = “I went too long without eating”, “I ate too fast because I went too long without eating” and hairballs), and one had lost a noticeable amount of weight (her current weight would be fine if she’d started there, but losing almost 20% of her body weight for no known reason is concerning). There was also behavior that made me think they didn’t like their food- things like persistently begging and then when I put new food down, sniffing it, looking upset and begging more. So I talked to the vet.</p>
<h2>Prescription Food and/or B12 vitamins (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MWKYP86/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MWKYP86&amp;linkId=8707696381553f9939f9fdf6dda878ff">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I started both of these at the same time and now the cats are down to vomiting once a week, tops, some of which is for cause. They don’t love the prescription food by they will eat it. They’re fine with the vitamins.</p>
<p>In terms of specific brands:</p>
<ul>
<li>They hate <a href="https://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/products/vet-products/feline-selected-protein-adult-pd-canned-cat-food">Royal Canin Duck and Pea protein</a>. When I included this in their diet they ate only two cans of food per day (one Royal Canin, one of their old food, Friskies), which is little enough that the already-underweight one was losing …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at daemons. We’ll understand exactly what they are, how they’re implemented, and the scope of their responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put, a daemon (pronounced dee-mon) is an intentionally orphaned background process. Additionally, daemons are detached from the terminal in which they’re spawned, operate without user interaction, and are descendants of the system’s init process.</p>



<p>Daemons will silently wait in the background for specific events to occur or conditions to be met before executing.</p>



<p>At boot time, Linux will start the init process (init is itself a daemon) which will serve as the parent of all processes and assign it PID 1 (process identification number). It’s important to mention that the init function is a special process that is not attached to any terminal.</p>



<p>After the boot sequence is complete, Linux will start up any previously declared daemons. These will be created through a series of fork() and exit() commands which will intentionally create an orphaned process that will eventually be adopted by the init process – more on this soon.</p>



<h2><strong>Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>Conventionally, daemon process names end with the letter “d”. If you’re interested in seeing all daemons installed on your Linux machine, use this command:</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<p>You’ve certainly encountered daemons whether you were aware of them or not:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A web server is simply a process that runs continuously in the background waiting to process and respond to HTTP requests (http daemon)</li><li>sshd is the dameon responsible for SSH operations</li><li>“MAILURE_DEMON” is a daemon that notifies the sender of invalid email recipients&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring hardware activity like hard drive health&nbsp;</li><li>cron jobs</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll take a look at the code to create a daemon shortly, but let’s establish some basics first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calling the fork() function creates a new process referred to as the child process. The child process runs in parallel with the process that triggered the fork() (the parent process).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A child process shares the same program counter and CPU registers as its parent. So, when a new child process is created, both the child and parent processes will execute the next instruction after the fork() call in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a simple example from Michigan Tech:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q9blfMxaFBFWjoLw_h9HxBAJYRhW5WO6ws4atHZKsY-6Bf5y9bu-EBQJ7qJ8F_piFCvK6wct0U-l9ykXRpt1DZZy_XdJZRCjnjx7WNjLpQu8sx59rsdAxQ25y-PGCJdGJ_VvpzwL" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>After fork(), both the parent and the child processes execute the following code in parallel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OeO_ztEonrxuE5Lw-N_7YS-3gOl0G0h8lQHUdax3632W6aooeiDSf7wOBIGU1aqyF_yCs6hnHv1IqJxtreeTsS_mkdukzMqcfbw2wPp_eEisclimHbtDUC45tetfvxQ_moeOVIvb" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>You can also make their execution paths differ if desired. If the fork() call succeeds, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a daemon, we’ll fork() to create a child process and then exit() the parent. This, as previously mentioned, will purposefully create an orphaned process that will be adopted by init. </p>



<p>Our new daemon is now free to sit silently in the background outside of any terminal and perform its task.</p>



<p>While this is a practical understanding, the actual implementation is a bit more nuanced. </p>



<p>We’ll need to make sure to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Close all open file descriptors</li><li>Change the working directory</li><li>Separate from the terminal and ignore I/O signals</li><li>Disassociate from the process group and control terminal</li><li>Don’t reacquire a control terminal </li><li>Reset the file access creation mask</li></ul>



<p>The following implementation is inspired by Pascal Werkl’s work. I’ve added additional documentation to make it more approachable for someone that is unfamiliar with C and/or Linux systems. I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/pasce/daemon-skeleton-linux-c/">checkout the original code here</a>.</p>







<h2>Understanding the double fork()</h2>



<p>Let’s try and understand why we need 2 fork() calls in the code above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we run this program in the terminal, several environmental settings – specifically the shell we’re working in – are replicated to our child process. So, we’ll need to disassociate our daemon from its spawning terminal.</p>



<p>That’s why we call <code>setsid()</code> and create our own independent session for the child process. </p>



<p>However, in doing so, this child process will be in its own session and process group and therefore it’ll be its own session leader. The main takeaway here is that there is potential for the session leader to reacquire a terminal later on (i..e. if say the user were to open up another terminal). </p>



<p>We don’t want that. Remember, we want to be completely independent of the terminal and any user-input.</p>



<p>By calling fork() a second time, we ensure that this new process (fork-2) will have a PID outside the bounds of fork-1’s session. Since we are not calling <code>setsid()</code> on the fork-2 process, no new session is being made. In other words, we know that fork-2 is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a session leader and therefore there’s no risk of it acquiring a terminal in the future. </p>



<p>Finally, by killing fork-2’s parent, we know that we’ve created an orphaned process that is adopted by init and can’t reacquire a terminal or be affected by user input.</p>



<blockquote><p>TLDR: The 2 fork() calls removes any chance of the daemon reacquiring a controlling terminal and helps ensure that the daemon is re-parented onto init. </p><p>If the use of the secondary fork() isn’t clear, don’t worry – it’s more to do with handling a potential edge case in the environment than a necessity in a generic daemon implementation.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks for checking out this article! If you have any topic requests, please contact me or leave a comment below!</p>



<p>If you’re interested in seeing all installed daemons on your machine, use this command on Linux machines:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<blockquote><p>Remember daemon names generally end in “d”</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>â€˜Just a second. I just need to respond to this one thing,â€™ I said to my daughter, as I attended to my iPhone.</p>
<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So The Register managed to incite a lot of discussion with a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/">headline</a>
that plain-text e-mail is a barrier to entry for kernel development. While
attention grabbing, this is actually not a new debate. Like a lot of tech
arguments this one seems to come up on a cyclical basis. Maybe because
maintainer summit didn’t happen this year it needed to come out elsewhere.
I gave a few thoughts on twitter but this topic really deserves a longer
look at the problem and what e-mail being a barrier really means.</p>

<p>Linux celebrated over <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commit-1-million-the-history-of-the-linux-kernel/">one million commits</a>
recently. The Linux Foundation also came out with a report about the
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/08/download-the-2020-linux-kernel-history-report/">history</a>
of kernel development. All of this work was completed with development being
done over e-mail. Clearly e-mail has been a successful method of development
for the past 29 years by many metrics.</p>

<p>So if it’s so successful why consider changing? Part of the answer to this
question lies in not what was accomplished by using e-mail but what was <em>not</em>
accomplished because e-mail was the preferred method of development. I
marked 10 years of being a full-time software professional a few weeks ago.
This was a recent enough time span that I can still remember enough of what
it was like to get started. There were a lot of steps to make sure your
e-mail setup was correct (i.e. plain text and no weird footers). It was a
little tricky but certainly doable. This is where the split comes in: what’s
‘a little tricky’ for one person may prevent someone else from contributing
at all. I was fortunate to have enough general working knowledge of Linux to
debug <code>git-send-email</code> when it didn’t work as well as having a corporate
setup that could actually send plain text e-mail. Google around for how to
set up <code>git-send-email</code> and you’ll see this is a step many people struggle with.</p>

<p>“But if you can’t even set up e-mail should you really be working on the
kernel?” This is unfortunately a common refrain in this discussion. I’d
turn the question on its head: why is setting up e-mail a core skill for
working on the kernel? There’s a lot of value in learning and following
community norms but what value does <em>that</em> particular norm bring? I’d argue
that showing you can set up and use plain text e-mail does not make you
a better kernel programmer. Supporting tooling for a project is important
but there’s nothing inherent to e-mail that makes it a good indicator of
anything. People can only handle keeping track of so many things at once.
Having to figure out plain text e-mail is one more task on the stack.
Reducing the overhead in mental load to participation lets people focus
much more on the actual kernel work. We can maintain tools that take less
work to run. Yes, the initial SMTP configuration is a one time setup but
sending out a patch each time with <code>git-send-email</code> involves a lot of manual
steps. Even if you get the manual steps right there’s always the chance
that your e-mail will be rejected due to over zealous spam filtering. There
was a three month period or so where all my e-mails to a particular maintainer
were being rejected because my 3rd party SMTP server had ended up on a spam
blocklist.</p>

<p>“But you can automate e-mail to do the manual parts” To some degree yes but
this is hard to do across the entire tree. The kernel has very few unifying
standards so for those who work across multiple areas you’re usually left
making a best educated guess about where things should go. MAINTAINERS is a
good start but it’s not always complete. And even if you <em>can</em> automate
everything expecting every contributor to come up with their own automation
is not a good use of time. “So provide everyone the automation” and there in
lies the problem: the fact that everyone can use their own setup is seen
as an advantage so it’s impossible to give something that works for everyone.
Even trying to guess what would be the most common setup to give some baseline
hasn’t been a fruitful conversation.</p>

<p>“So GitHub is the answer to our problems?” I’m not saying that either.
“kids these days are using GitHub so we should switch too” is a very weak
argument. Familiarity with a tool is a factor but it shouldn’t be the biggest
factor. Everyone, new and experienced developers, can learn new tools. If I
thought that e-mail was a suitable tool I would be promoting it as something
newer developers should learn. Compare that with git which both new and
experienced people will tell you can be difficult to use. It <em>is</em> worthwhile
to learn git though and there’s been some improvement in UX recently
(<code>git switch</code>). One objection to GitHub is the fact that it’s a proprietary
platform. I’m not willing to entertain conspiracy theories about GitHub
being owned by Microsoft and therefore wanting to destroy the Linux kernel
but before committing to any cloud platform it’s important to do due diligence.
Part of the concern about the ‘forge’ nature of GitHub is that it ends
up being an single point of failure. Anyone who has tried to get work done
when its down will know what a pain this is. The issue is that despite the
fact that git is a distributed version control system you end up needing
to host your repositories <em>somewhere</em> for pull requests to be useful. Anything
that’s useful is going to end up being popular so you’re going to end up
with more points of failure. “What if we all just hosted our own git trees”
running infrastructure takes time, energy, and money, it’s really nice to
not have to think about things like that.</p>

<p>“But e-mail is so much better for discussion and patch review” it’s hard
to differentiate sometimes between “better because I’m more familiar with it”
and “better because it has features I care about”. Is the experience of
reviewing code in GitHub identical to reviewing code in e-mail? No. The
steps are different. It’s never going to match 1-to-1. Do I think code
review in GitHub is usable? Absolutely. Would I take GitHub review over
e-mail? Unclear mostly because it’s hard for me to separate everything else
I hate about e-mail patches from the review part. One nice advantage of
GitHub is that it is incredibly easy to jump in on threads without having
subscribed to the thread first. <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html">lore.kernel.org</a>
has improved the experience of replying via e-mail significantly by providing
instructions and download links but it’s not as easy as point and click.
lore.kernel.org has also improved the archiving experience significantly
which was another area of concern with e-mail. Even with a proper archiving
system, discussion is still disconnected from both bug reporting and the
code review with e-mail. E-mail is really a lousy bug reporting system
simply because it’s easy for things to get lost. “You can filter e-mail”
yes, if you know what to filter on. Again, everyone having bespoke artisinal
e-mail filters doesn’t actually solve the problem. Having a distinct
separation between bug reports and new code is much easier to keep straight.
I also grow weary of having to explain to new contributors that LKML is
mostly just an archive and sending anything to LKML without another cc is
probably not going to get a response (a great way to discourage contributors).
Again, there is documentation out there to explain how to contribute but it
doesn’t actually <em>need</em> to be this complicated.</p>

<p>“GitHub could never scale to the volume of the Linux Kernel” This is an
interesting point. There was some discussion on twitter about monorepos.
The kernel does appear to be unique in terms of number of contributors and
volume of commits. Maybe GitHub can’t actually scale. That shouldn’t mean
the only option ever is e-mail. Git itself came out of a need for a version
control system that matched what the kernel needed (we’ll ignore other
parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a> saga).
The scaling issue often comes up when discussing CI. Those outside the
kernel community are somewhat shocked and appalled about how much manual
work happens. <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a> has come a long
way in integrating CI as part of the regular development process. It’s not
clear if a traditional CI system like GitHub offers would even make sense.
For one, testing kernels requires either physical machines to test on or
a virtual environment, neither of which are particularly standard for setups
like GitHub. The kernel is also (intentionally) designed to work on an
incredibly wide variety of hardware. Testing every commit against all
possible hardware is next to impossible. Even choosing a limited set of hardware
can quickly create a bottleneck for getting anything merged. KernelCI has
done a great job trying to balance coverage and speed. Part of the issue
with the scaling argument is that it’s a bit of chicken and egg to determine
if something like GitHub would actually scale. We can’t switch over because
we are concerned it might not scale but we can’t really know if it scales
until we switch over. The kernel likes small incremental changes but switching
development workflows may be impossible to do incrementally.</p>

<p>Plain text e-mail may not be the biggest barrier for many people wanting
to do kernel development but it can still be one. There are plenty of reasons
to want something better than e-mail for development. There may be some
reasons to stay on e-mail because no better tool exists but “lowering the
bar” or other gatekeeping nonsense is not among the reasons. I personally
eagerly await the day I don’t have to think about e-mailing patches.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>
