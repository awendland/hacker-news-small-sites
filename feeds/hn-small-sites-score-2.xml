  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Over the past 8 weeks, I built a HomeKit accessory to open and close the gate at the end of my driveway.  The project was really fun, and this document outlines the process of creating it, from concept to working prototype.</p>

<h3 id="additional-background">Additional Background</h3>

<p>Programming examples for microcontrollers will be in C++.  For the most part, we’ll be sticking essentially to “C with Classes”, which is typical of most Arduino and other microcontroller projects.</p>

<p>The data in this document is by no means meant to be comprehensive.  I am not an electrical engineer, and welcome any corrections or other feedback.  Where possible, I’ve cited references or resources I found useful at each step.  For the most part, extensive googling served as the primary research tool.</p>

<p>The swing gate in question is a Sentex Crown Jewel, which was available in the early 2000s. It interfaces with a home phone system to control 1 or 2 relays.  Programming is performed either via the gate keypad, or via 300 baud modem connected to a Windows program.  Later in this document we’ll show how to use a listening modem to eavesdrop on the communication to reverse engineer the app-only commands which are not in the publicly available references.</p>

<p>Further data for those interested can be found</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/51eik7/6001141">Crown Jewel Programming manual</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/np06ng/6001145">Crown Jewel Installation manual</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>The problem I aimed to solve was to interface the gate microcontroller to HomeKit.  The only interfaces to the gate are a keypad (outside the gate) and a home phone line.  The previous owners did not install the manual operation switch, so I would frequently forget to open the gate when walking into town, get to the gate, then go back inside to dial the phone access code.  It would be great to just pull out a phone or say “hey Siri open the gate”.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to decompose the goal into tasks small enough that each can have easily understandable requirements and success criteria.  Another benefit of this process is that having many small tasks to complete will give us a sense of accomplishment and provide motivation as we complete them 🙂</p>

<h3 id="problem-1---phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Problem 1 - Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h3>

<p>Objective: Implement software library that can send and receive phone number tones, and communicate with a 300 baud modem.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones to keep HomeKit state in sync when other users control the gate from the phone line.</li>
  <li>Take phone off hook and dial numbers to control gate relay.</li>
  <li>Communicate via 300 baud modem (Bell 103) protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-2---homekit-support">Problem 2 - HomeKit Support</h3>

<p>Objective: The microcontroller + phone line interface should appear as a home kit accessory.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Successfully pair the device with HomeKit</li>
  <li>Implement a service that  allows opening and closing the gate</li>
  <li>Demonstrate control via “Hey Siri open the gate”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-3---physical-prototype">Problem 3 - Physical prototype</h3>

<p>Objective: Combine the proofs of concept of the phone interface, and homekit device, into a single logic board, have that board manufactured, and enclose it in a case.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capture a schematic which contains all necessary circuits for correct operation of the system.</li>
  <li>Arrange the physical design of those components and signals into a printed circuit board using a CAD program.</li>
  <li>Manufacture the board.</li>
  <li>Enclose the assembled board in a case so we can handle it safely and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h2>

<p>The first piece of the project is the phone line interface.  Reviewing the requirements from earlier, our first requirement is “Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones”.</p>

<p>Decomposing this further, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand how to interface a microcontroller to a phone line</li>
  <li>Understand how to take the phone “off hook”</li>
  <li>Do some signal processing to detect tones, for example, someone pressing the number “9” on a phone keypad.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-access-arrangement">Digital Access Arrangement</h3>

<p>In the United States, home phone lines usually consist of a pair of wires, Tip and Ring, with a nominal -48VDC between them.  These wires carry the signal (voice or data), and the voltage and resistance between them indicates various states (on hook, off hook, ringing, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service" title="Wikipedia Plain Old Telephone Service">Additional info at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Since the voltage on the lines (48v) is well above that typically interfaced to a microcontroller (1.8-5.0v), we need some circuitry to extract the signal from the phone line, convert it to a voltage compatible with our processor.  Additionally, this circuitry should provide isolation of our circuitry from the phone circuit, to protect against transient voltage spikes.  A nice discussion of isolation is <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN1167.pdf" title="Safety Considerations for Silicon Labs Series Capacitor Isolators">here</a>.  In this application we’ve chosen to use a surge suppression capacitor that will fail open but magnetic isolation via a small transformer is also common in modem designs.</p>

<p>Since there are quite a few components in even simplified / cost reduced DAA’s (see page 21, &lt;&gt;) I opted to buy a reference board for the <a href="https://ixysic.com/Products/LITELINK.htm">Ixys CPC5622 Litelink III DAA</a>. Additional info can be found in the <a href="https://www.ixysic.com/home/pdfs.nsf/www/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf/$file/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf">CPC5622-EVAL Evaluation Board Users Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-arduino-uno">Integration With Arduino Uno</h3>

<p>Connecting the Eval board for the Litelink DAA to the Arduino so that we can start looking at phone line signals is pretty straight forward.  Looking at the Fritzing diagram below, we’ve connected an I2C oled to the Uno so we can see what’s happening.  The eval board implements DC-blocking capacitors on the TX/RX lines, so we implement a voltage divider with a pair of resistors, and connect the RX line (pink) from the 5622 to A0 on the Uno, putting the “zero point” at 1.65V (3.3/2).  We wire up a phone jack to the J1 header on the eval board, and we connect 3.3v through a 10k resistor to AREF on the Uno, setting the analog reference for ADC measurements at 3.3 * 32/(32+10) == 2.5v.  Since the Uno doesn’t have a differential ADC, the Vpp (peak to peak voltage) on the RX+ line from the eval board should be &lt;1V so we shouldn’t clip under normal operation, and get more precision out of the ADC by using more of its range vs. the standard 0-5V.  “Off Hook” (orange) is pulled up as required by the 5622.</p>

<p><img src="https://sampo3k.github.io/images/fritzing.jpg" alt="5622EVAL Fritzing"></p>

<p>Success!  At this point, we can read A0, and see the voltage held roughly constant at 1.65v when on hook, and if you pick up a receiver on the phone line connected to the 5622, you will start seeing the voltage vary as the call progress (dial) tone is received, or connect an oscilloscope and visualize it.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</h3>

<p>Now we have an analog signal into our Uno, and can move on to the next requirement: decode DTMF tones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling" title="Link to Wikipedia article on DTMF">Dual-tone multi-frequency</a> (DTMF) is way each key on a phone key pad is converted into analog signals.  The wikipedia article does a really good job summarizing what’s going on.</p>

<p>At this point we need to do some Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to figure out which frequencies are present in the signal we’re receiving, and then see if there are exactly two strong signals that happen to be one of the 16 DTMF pairs.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go too deeply into DSP here, but for a better understanding of what we’re trying to do, I cannot recommend these two resources highly enough.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/">Intro to DSP</a>: This website has amazing interactive tutorials that explains some of the fundamentals of digital signal processing in a really neat and useful way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">DSP book</a>: This book is a wealth of information on DSP techniques, and the PDFs of each chapter are available for free.  With some effort, you can even concatenate them together into the entire book :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tone-detection">Tone Detection</h3>

<p>For DTMF, the typical sequence we are looking for is &gt;=100ms of tone and &gt;=100ms of silence repeated for however many digits we are listening for.</p>

<p>The common approach to frequency detection is an FFT.  However, the performance of the 16MHz ATMega328P makes this difficult.  For example, we need the FFT bins about 70Hz apart or less to discriminate the DTMF tones.  So that means at 8KHz we need roughly  8000/70 = 114 samples or more.  Rounding up to a convenient power of 2 for the FFT, we’ll say 256/2 = 128 FFT bins. The bins will be 8KHz / 128 = 62.5Hz apart.</p>

<p>To do a 256 sample FFT, in addition to a reasonable amount of memory, we’d need something on the order of ~8k multiplies and ~8k additions, which given the performance of 16x16+32 MAC is around 50 cycles, our most wildly optimistic projection here if we hand coded a great FFT is like 25-30ms, or about 0.5x realtime. This seems to line up well with the results on this <a href="https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2019/03/arduino-fft-pt-2-improving-the-hardware-for-real-time-analysis/" title="Arduino FFT pt. 2: Improving the Hardware for Real-time Analysis">Arduino FFT post</a>. We also use the same performance hack noted there to reduce the ADC prescaler on the ATMega328 so that ADC reads don’t take so long.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm">Goertzel algorithm</a> which is essentially a single-frequency digital filter.  Doing 8 applications of the Goertzel algorithm including the ADC reads only takes about 12ms, which is about 1.2x realtime.  I think, based on the output of <a href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org</a> that AVR GCC is generating full 32x32 multiplies for 16x16+32 -&gt; 32 MAC so some hand assembly could probably make this go faster.</p>

<p>In order to generate some test cases for our code, I used this <a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/audiocheck_dtmf.php">DTMF WAV file generator</a> and converted the resulting WAV files into virtual ADC samples in the range of our analog circuit.  I then ran our detection code, to verify the algorithm correctness before moving it to the Uno.  A reasonable sample Goertzel implementation can be found <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/design_tip/dm00446805-the-goertzel-algorithm-to-compute-individual-terms-of-the-discrete-fourier-transform-dft-stmicroelectronics.pdf" title="The Goertzel algorithm to compute individual terms of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)">here</a></p>

<h3 id="bell-103">Bell 103</h3>

<p>Programming the gate microcontroller is done via the 300 baud modem protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_103_modem">Bell 103</a>.  The RX side of this seems well within the Uno’s capabilities, as we can likely count the number of zero crossings in every 3ms baud window to discriminate between the mark and space frequencies used by the <a href="http://edge.rit.edu/content/P09141/public/FSK.pdf">FSK</a> encoding.</p>

<p>The TX side however, seems much trickier on the Uno.  The Uno lacks a DAC, and while you can create one using PWM on a digital pin and then put it through a low pass filter, this seemed like a lot of work.  About this time I also wanted to get going on HomeKit portion of the project, and I took the easy way out: using an actual modem.</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/8 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/8">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">an article</a> explaining functors in simple terms and show why they are useful. It has well received, but some felt it was lacking in details which is true and by design. There is more to be said and some crucial details that I glossed over so I will try to address some of them now. Let’s get nerdy!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Functor as a context</h2>
<p>In the previous article I said you could think of a functor as a structure or container that has a mapping function. This is not strictly wrong as it is one way of thinking about the concept, but can be a bit misleading and confusing as it does not fit all situations. For example a functions can in some cases be a functor. A structure might give us thoughts about data structures or types. Container is fitting when talking about lists or other types that can contain data. Is a function a structure or container? For this reason it is common to refer to some of the general concepts and abstractions we use in FP (functor, monad etc.) as contexts which has some properties.</p>
<h2>The functor laws</h2>
<p>Unlike my vague explanation in the previous article a functor is actually a very specific thing, and is defined by rules or properties the context has to adhere to. These laws come from mathematics, specifically a branch called Category Theory. This is an area that I will not claim much knowledge of but great minds have found similarities between this particular part of mathematics and what we do in programming. </p>
<p>In addition to having the <code>map</code> function, functors needs to follow some rules.
The rules for functors are often called the functor laws. I'm not completely sure why. It might have something to do with math and also its sounds very sophisticated. :P Let’s get in on the sophistication!</p>
<h3>1. Law of preservation of identity</h3>
<p>The first law or rule of functors is that if the <code>map</code> function is given the identity function as its mapping function it will return the same functor.
The identity function is just a function that has one argument which it returns right back (<code>\x -&gt; x</code> in Elm or <code>function(x){return x;}</code> in JS).</p>
<p>Let’s use lists to visualize this a bit more. Elm actually has the identity function in its standard library so we will just use that one:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>List.map</span> <span>identity</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the javascript example we will add the identify function inline:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When following this law the functor can not make any weird changes to the result. <code>List.map someFunction [1,2,3,4]</code> can never return an empty list. It can only map the function over the values. When mapping over a 4 item list, the returning list will always be a 4 item list. </p>
<h3>2. Law of composition</h3>
<p>The second law is not very complicated either but assumes that you know about composition. Lets quickly go through composition before looking at the next law.</p>
<h4>Composition</h4>
<p>Composition in functional programming (FP) is the ability to compose multiple functions into one single function. This is not often used in object oriented programming (OOP) but quite common in FP. </p>
<p>Composition is "gluing" functions together into one function. This is such a common thing to do that many languages have dedicated operators for this. Lets look at an example to see it in action to see why this might be useful. I'll be doing the examples in Elm as composition is a bit awkward in javascript and not that common.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a user record that has the fields name and age:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get the age of a User record we can in Elm use an accessor function which is available for every field defined in a record.<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> For the <code>age</code> field this function is called <code>.age</code> and has the type signature <code>User -&gt; Int</code>. It takes a <code>User</code> type as an argument and returns a <code>Int</code>. In this case it is the content of the age field.</p>
<p>Go get the age from a user you would to: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>


<span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At some point in your program you might have a <code>User</code> and need to display the age on a webpage, print it in a log or anything else that needs the age to be a string. To convert a <code>Int</code> into a <code>String</code> we can use the built-in function <code>fromInt</code> in the String module. </p>
<p>So where you have a user and need the age as a string you can use the compose operator in Elm to create a new function that gives you the user age as a string. I will write the type signatures for the functions as well so we can see how they fit together: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>

<span>fromInt</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

<span>ageAsString</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>ageAsString</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fromInt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the output of a function matches the input of another we can compose them together and make a new function that has the input of the first and output of the second. Note that <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the rightwards compose operator.<sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4>The second law</h4>
<p>Now that you hopefully know a bit about function composition lets look at the second law of functors. The rule says that composing functions into a single function and then mapping that function over the functor should produce the same result as mapping the individual functions over the functor in sequence. Lets look as some code to make sense of it:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>User</span>
<span>users</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>[</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Mary"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>22</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Kevin"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>users</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>String.fromInt</span>

<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>=</span> 
	<span>List.map</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>String.fromInt</span><span>)</span> <span>users</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we have a list of users and two constants<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> that both are a list of the users’ ages as strings. </p>
<p>The first constant, <code>agesThroughMaps</code>, is defined using two map operations. The first run passes the <code>.age</code> accessor function to <code>map</code> and gives us a list of ages (of type <code>Int</code>). In the second map operation the <code>String.fromInt</code> is used to create a list of the users’ ages as <code>String</code>. </p>
<p>For the last constant, <code>agesTthroughMaps</code>, the list of the users age is created with one map operation where the function passed in to <code>map</code> is composed of the <code>.age</code> and <code>fromInt</code> functions with the compose operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>). </p>
<p>And this is the result of the second law: the values in the two constants should be equal. A list of strings: <code>["20", "22", "30"]</code></p>
<p>See full example in Ellie: <a href="https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1">https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1</a></p>
<h2>The consequences of the laws</h2>
<p>The laws might seem a bit random and not very helpful at first glance, but it can actually help us a lot. To be a functor the structure/container/context has to follow these laws. It can not do anything weird with the value/values in it or the function that is passed inn. The only thing it can do is apply the function to the value in the context. The functor might have some extra logic around when to apply the function. A list might be empty so there would be nothing to apply the function to and similarly with <code>Maybe</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">last years article</a> to see a more complex example.</p>
<p>With these rules for what constitutes a functor in place the behavior of functors become predictable. So if we see it in code or talk about it with fellow coders we know exactly how it should behave! 😄</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>To make matters worse: the company behind the app were in the middle of a perfect storm. The business was being changed by regulation. The core business idea were changing. This meant large changes coming to the digital side, including the app.</p>
<p>Naturally, we had quite mixed feelings about our ability to meet delivery expectations from the business side, given the bad state of the app codebase. We were at a crossroads, and felt we had to pick one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Negotiate a feature timeout while we frantically renovate the core code, or</li>
<li>Start a long-term migration plan towards a hybrid app, or</li>
<li>Write new features in React Native and eventually move all the JS code over to a new app shell</li>
</ol>
<p>We decided to try out React Native. Roughly three years later, the app is now 100% JavaScript. The big business transformation has come a long way, and I’ve experienced that React Native as a technology has played a key role in that success.</p>
<p>This article contains some reflections on <em>why</em> switching from pure native technologies to React Native worked so well for us.</p>
<h2>Starting Out Small Felt Really Safe</h2>
<p>We gave React Natives two tests. First, we wrote a small feature with a few developers. Futhermore, we did a larger, several-month feature where the entire team participated. A critical part of the tests was making sure that React Native would work as the small cogwheel it would necessarily start out as, inside of the large legacy app monster.</p>
<p>The people involved in each phase would evaluate the React Native developer experience, carefully considering if moving forward with React Native would be the right choice for us. After all, continuing with RN would mean a long migration process. Lots of our features would exist in the old, smelly native code for a long time, we would have to manually ensure backwards compatibility, handle (deep) navigation from old to new code (and vice verca), and lots of other things.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges in mind, the team were crystal clear post-testing. React Native made work easier, faster and more fun! In case we’d conclude differently, the investment made was so low that we could safely discard the effort as a proof-of-concept, where the learnings were enough to justify the time spent.</p>
<p>Trying out new technology this way just seems like a very smart way to do it. It was also key that it was the voice of the developers spending all day with the technology that weighed the most.</p>
<h2>We Actually Did Develop New Features Much Faster</h2>
<p>They say React Native save you half the work. Since your code will run on both iOS and Android, it eliminates the need to develop separate code &nbsp;for each platform. Write code once – not twice. Neat!</p>
<p>In our experience, this was mostly true. We did end up doing minor platform customizations here and there. Shadows don’t work as well on Android as iOS. Sometimes you’d want different UI behaviours to adhere to platform guidelines. And as with web development, you’ll encounter visual bugs for each platform that need special attention.</p>
<p><strong>I’d say we saved about 45% of the work involved.</strong> It’s not half - but it still makes a tremendous difference on productivity!</p>
<p>It’s also hard to not talk about the productivity boost obtained by Hot Reload (now Fast Refresh). Seeing the effect of my last code edit presented visually on screen immediately (with state preserved) is simply marvelous. Scale up the time saved for each little change with the amount of the developers involved and the amount of time spent… it’s just huge!</p>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/fastrefresh.gif" alt="animation showing how react-native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot; works" title="React Native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot;"></p>
<h2>All Developers Code For Both Platforms</h2>
<p>I’ve met hundreds of fine developers, if not thousands. But those skilled and efficient in both native iOS and native Android development - I can count them on one hand. And they’re not exactly looking for work.</p>
<p>With React Native, we experienced that the entire team could do work for both platforms. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this fact. Instead of having dedicated iOS and Android teams, we’d have a feature being made by the same person (or small group) on both platforms, reducing the overhead involved in coordination and organization between devs and designers, business folks, product owners, etc. Also, fewer people needed to learn the ins and outs of that particular feature in a quite complex domain.</p>
<p>This provides great flexibility and robustness for a development team, and was much needed in our setting.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and Onboarding</h2>
<p>Not too many people are familiar with native mobile technologies. In comparison, capable JavaScript/React-developers come a dime a dozen. We found that finding talent was easier, and the newcomers found themselves productive way quicker than we’d expect. In a period with frantic scaling and expansion, this was critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine recruiting top-notch mobile development specialists is easier if you’re a huge company with infinite resources. In that case, you could staff the necessary amount of specialist teams for iOS and Android and just steamroll whatever you’re making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Norwegian market, with finite resources, easing your requirements from <em>«five years of Swift»</em> to <em>«five years of JavaScript experience»</em> makes all the difference. The programming language in itself is one thing, but there’s also the ecosystem, development enviroment, IDE, etc. Apple make a lot of really sweet products, but XCode surely isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2>Team Organization</h2>
<p>Our old codebase was.. entangled. I imagine it would be challenging to attempt doing distributed development on the same codebase across several teams. At least when aiming for near-continuous delivery. Doing a Spotify-like product team organization with an app dev in each team seemed utopian at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few years, we went from a dedicated mobile team of five to a product team organization with near 20 mobile developer spread across all teams. This would be much harder without the flexibility and familiarity of <em>«it’s just JavaScript»</em> or <em>«it´s just React»</em>. Not having to invest as much time and energy in specialist competencies for iOS or Android, app devs have more cognitive surplus to work on other things as well - web, cloud stuff, backend, UX-collaboration, etc.</p>
<h2>Deploy To Production At Will</h2>
<p>Mobile apps have always had a longer way to production. The <em>«quality control»</em> mechanism with manual app reviews adds several days to the pipeline. The Apple App Store was alone responsible for up to a 14-day delay at it’s worst, although the wait times have been vastly reduced since then. Now they’re averaging at about a day.</p>
<p>A good dev team in 2020 will deploy to production many times each day. Looking at some of the biggest Norwegian apps today, it is not uncommon to see two-three-four week old builds as the most recent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The negative effects of not releasing your code often, and not even having the possibility to release at will, are well documented. React Native with it’s <em>over the air</em>-update called <em>CodePush</em> allows for continous delivery, even for mobile apps!&nbsp;</p>
<p>CodePush allows your app code to download the latest version of the compressed JavaScript bundle from a third-party server. When a user opens the app, the new bundle is downloaded and immediately installed. Voilà – immediate deploy to production!</p>
<p>Our app’s release cycle went from semi-monthly to several releases per day. Paired with great monitoring, this reduces the need for testing. Non-critical bugs can be tolerated to a larger degree if they don’t reach your entire audience before they’re automatically detected and shortly fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product development is also way faster. The team can iterate on small changes on real customers in production as a part of the development process, instead of lengthy sketching and laboratory user testing. This made the entire organization more customer-focused and impatient for real customer feedback.</p>
<h2>A Note On The Rewrite</h2>
<p>The whole codebase transformation to React Native took about two years. We only wrote already-planned new features in React Native, allowing us to be productive and produce new features during the process. The business transformation underway meant that most of the features would have required changes anyway, and it could actually be faster to implement them from scratch in React Native than to modify the legacy code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant that we didn’t need a feature-freeze period with the team stuck on unproductive rewrite work. However, when most of the old app was rewritten, we needed a month-long cleanup to move all the separate features in the old app over to a new, fresh React Native repo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From around March 2017 until June 2019 the app was in a state where some features existed in the old codebase and others in the new codebase. That wasn’t a pleasant situation, but not more unpleasant than working in the old legacy codebase before.</p>
<h2>Status As We’re Looming On 2021</h2>
<p>A total of <strong>10,000 commits</strong> have been made by <strong>33 contributors</strong> across <strong>5 teams.</strong>. Nearly 50 pull-requests from 14 authors was merged the past week. Our ability to deliver on business requirements have been strengthened. Looking back on our big choice of 2017, it’s truly awe-inspiring to see how big an effect a simple technology choice can have on helping teams reach lofty goals.</p>
<p>No technology is a silver bullet. React Native surely isn’t either. But it does have some truly wonderful effects on an impatient, agile, modern development organization that Swift, Kotlin or C# currently can’t offer, in my opinion.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. When a message is encrypted with a secure algorithm, i.e. an encryption cipher, no one should be able to read it without the decryption key. However, the promise of security falls apart if the encryption algorithm is weak, or if someone has created a backdoor. In this article we’ll examine the modern history of encryption. We’ll learn that while the mathematical underpinnings of modern encryption is stronger than ever, government agencies have a history of thwarting efforts to reach the goal of truly secure communication. </p>
</section><article><section><p>The world’s first encryption ciphers often used algorithms that were themselves secret. The rather intuitive belief that security increases if the encryption details are hidden is a misconception, and is often referred to as <em>security by obscurity</em>. The algorithms that dominate the modern era rely on full openness, in accordance with <em>Kerckhoffs's principle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This transparency allows the rest of the world to attempt to break the cipher. Every failed attempt at breaking a cipher reinforces the belief that it is secure. While there is a chance that someone breaks a cipher and does not report it, there is a far greater chance that a homemade algorithm will be broken easily.</p>
<h2>A big moment in cryptographic history</h2>
<p>Up until 1972 there was no standard cipher for encrypting secret messages. The US <em>National Bureau of Standards (NBS)</em>, which later became the <em>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</em>, started an initiative for finding a single secure algorithm. This was rather revolutionary. The American government had traditionally kept their knowledge of cryptography to themselves - they considered it to be crucial to national security. As a result of the NIST initiative, several ciphers were proposed as candidates for the first encryption standard.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate was contributed by a team of cryptographers working at IBM. They developed a refined version of an earlier encryption cipher called Lucifer, which was first developed by Horst Feistel in the late 1960s. Their candidate was a block cipher with a key size of 128 bits. A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts several bits at a time, i.e. a block of bits, as opposed to stream ciphers that encrypts bit by bit. A sufficiently large key size is necessary for a cipher to withstand brute force attacks, since these attacks generate all possible decryption keys. In context of a brute force attack, one would say that the larger the key size the more robust the cipher.</p>
<h2>Speculation of NSA backdoors</h2>
<p>When the NIST examined the security of the cipher candidates, they reached out to the <em>National Security Agency (NSA)</em> for assistance. At this point in time the NSA did not even admit their own existence. The involvement of the NSA lead to speculation and rumors, since the cipher went through a couple of peculiar alterations during the cooperation between NSA and IBM. </p>
<p>The most worrying change was that the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits. This made the cipher considerably less resistant to brute force attacks. Concerns were raised that this change was motivated by the NSA, in order to provide themselves with a backdoor. Maybe their computers were powerful enough to brute force a key size of 56 bits – but not quite powerful enough to brute force a key size of 128 bits? </p>
<p>The cipher was also altered to be resistant to attacks using differential cryptanalysis. That doesn’t sound too bad, but this particular attack was not known to the public until 1990 – almost 20 years later! If the NSA were familiar with an attack the world would need 20 more years to discover, it is not hard to believe that they might be able to brute force a 56 bit key. However, it should be noted that none of these claims have been proven. </p>
<p>In 1977, the NIST presented an altered version of the IBM cipher as the new standard, which they named the <em>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</em>. It became the first modern, public, freely available encryption algorithm. All details regarding DES were made public, which is good practice since it allows researchers to scrutinize the mathematical details. However, the motivation for the design criteria remained secret. The public never learned why the key size was reduced, and this was the main cause for suspicion regarding the involvement of the NSA.</p>
<h2>DES cracked through brute force attack</h2>
<p>DES was initially meant to be the standard cipher for encryption for 10 years; from 1977 to 1987. But no serious weakness was found, and DES went on to reign as the standard algorithm for more than a decade past its due; until 1999.
In the final years of DES, several attempts were made to design and build a machine to brute force it. Building such a machine would cost millions of dollars. It was speculated that only government agencies would have the necessary financial resources to build it, and by this time it was widely believed that the NSA could in fact crack DES.</p>
<p>As the price of hardware fell, the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</em> built the machine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">Deep Crack</a>.
In 1998 Deep Crack was able to brute force DES in 56 hours. This event demonstrated that it was time to select a new standard cipher for encryption.</p>
<p>In 1997, the NIST initiated an open competition to find a new standard encryption cipher. The competition had five finalists:
<a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc688.012/rijndael/rijndael_doc_V2.pdf">Rijndael</a>,
<a href="http://cryptosoft.de/docs/Mars.pdf">Mars</a>,
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.1151&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">RC6</a>,
<a href="http://www.networkdls.com/Articles/serpent.pdf">Serpent</a> and
<a href="http://gazizova.net/pub/Library/ihtik_Library/dvd_(%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BE)%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/rea_2/Schneider%20B.Twofish.A%20128-bit%20block%20cipher.1998.pdf">Twofish</a>.
This time the selection process was completely transparent. In 2001, after three competitive rounds and intense cryptanalysis by the world’s foremost experts, the decision was made. The cipher Rijndael, designed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was declared as the new standard. It was given the name <em>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</em>. This cipher has three possible key sizes: 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. All these key sizes were sufficiently large to withstand brute force attacks.</p>
<p>AES is widely regarded as the most secure encryption cipher invented. It has been battle-tested for decades and is expected to remain the standard cipher for many years to come. So far there are neither any known critical weaknesses, nor suspicion of backdoors.</p>
<h2>Attempts at legalizing government backdoors</h2>
<p>Algorithms have matured to be practically unbreakable, but current legislative measures attempt to undermine the basic purpose of cryptography. There are recurrent proposals for allowing government backdoors. For instance, the recently proposed <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity"><em>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</em></a> aims to force technology companies to implement backdoors. The right to privacy ends when the government institutions deem it useful to their own agenda. If such a law were to pass, the consequences would be immediate and severe. It would grant immense power to the government, and if a key is leaked or stolen, all encrypted communications are out in the open. Lawmakers argue that having a backdoor would help fight crime and terrorism, but this view assumes that criminals play by the rules and communicate through services using government issued encryption. </p>
<p>In the modern era the goal of private digital communication is, from a technological standpoint, a solved problem. It remains to see if future citizens will be able to enjoy digital privacy in their lives. It’s a question of balancing power between the government and the people – and problems of that nature are not solved as elegantly as cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p><em>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, I highly recommend listening to the following episode of the Darknet Diaries podcast: <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/12/">Episode 12 - Crypto Wars</a>.</em></p></section></article></div>]]>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

This could include porting configuration, integrating with CI, or even adding new features and configuration to Rome.</p> <p>Interested in something else or have questions?

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=YmY0MDNlNzYxN2QwM2UxZmMwZGU0MDY5YjZlNGE2OGIxNjYzN2EyZSxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607574919">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=NDJmZWUwYjA4MmJmMjJhMjAyZDIxZWUyNDQ5MTZkMTEyMGEzODU0ZSxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607574919">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

These peptides are small synthetically produced portions of viral sequences. A peptide-based vaccine is not infectious. We have selected these peptides as the basis for our vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The antigen portion of the vaccine can be substituted by other antigens; for example, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD. By appropriate selection of antigens, the intranasal vaccine design described here can also be adapted for use against other viruses, especially respiratory viruses, such as influenza or non-SARS coronaviruses.</li><li><strong>Chitosan nanoparticle delivery</strong>. Chitosan is a form of chitin, which is found in mushrooms and the shells of crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs (seafood allergies are not allergies to chitin). Chitosan acts as both delivery vehicle and immunostimulatory adjuvant.</li><li><strong>Extremely simple and inexpensive preparation</strong> with easily obtained materials.</li><li><strong>Short-term safety. </strong>This type of vaccine has shown excellent safety in animal studies and human clinical trials. The RaDVaC vaccine has been used repeatedly over several months,  by over 100 self-experimenters, with the most extreme complication in some recipients of stuffy noses. </li></ul>



<p>Protocols for the simple and robust production of chitosan nanoparticle vaccines for intranasal delivery have been published for over two decades. Intranasal delivery of chitosan-based vaccines have shown mild side effects and high levels of efficacy of both mucosal and systemic immunity, when delivered in a prime-boost regimen (in both animal models and human trials). </p>

<p>I recently talked to a company growing and selling in-home hydroponic kits to grow crops in an apartment in the city for example, where most people do not have gardens like in suburbia. Given my experience in the startup world as well as in technology, I thought of their idea for some time and realized that there are quite a few business models that they can go towards, as they had the tech but didn't know how to progress it into an actual business.</p>
<p>Here's the list I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the infrastructure (but not the infrastructure itself) with which customers can then do whatever they want
<ul>
<li>Sell access to hydroponics kits (kits) for individuals, restaurants, companies (groups) to grow their own crops, but they have to maintain it themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> - Selling infrastructure with less control over the details but more ease of use for customers
<ul>
<li>Sell access to kits with certain crops already available, and groups can pick what they want to grow, and perhaps customize the crops and crop choice</li>
<li><em>Serverless</em> - Grow crops on demand based on needed capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the product without selling the infrastructure itself to run the product
<ul>
<li>Sell the crops themselves to groups so that they don't need to grow crops themselves</li>
<li>Boutique grocery stores</li>
<li>Delivery of crops on a regular basis</li>
<li>Delivery of meal kits on a regular basis with additional included groceries such as pasta or rice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</strong> - Sell remote access to the product
<ul>
<li>Monitor crops from anywhere with a web app or mobile app. The app could show crop yields, stats, expected time to delivery, expected time to expiration, et cetera</li>
<li>Complementary to the other models, not a replacement</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Allow other people to grow crops and sell them locally</li>
<li>The crowdsourced Uber/Airbnb model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list came up due to my experience in business and technology, but if I had expertise in other fields, then this list would've been different. Learn from different domains and create analogies between them to think of new ideas and combinations of those ideas.</p>

<p><span>The world has changed and nothing will be the same: Companies all around the world are shifting to remote work, employees have been adopting new work habits for more than 8 months now. So let’s be honest, employees won’t return to the office as before. Remote work is no longer a temporary situation. You have to create your future environment of work right now because it’s the new norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So when companies shift suddenly from a 100% office environment to a home environment, what do they do? They shift all their in person meetings to video meetings! Really?? Some even double down on it to be sure their employees are working!!</span></p>
<p><span>What happened? Zoom fatigue became the new popular hashtag and people were less productive and less engaged. And we are not talking about “Zoom bombing”!</span></p>
<p><span>I think we have to completely reinvent the way of working, communicating, collaborating and learning in this new world and not just duplicate what we do in person in a digital form.</span></p>
<p><strong>I BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS ASYNC VIDEO COMMUNICATION.</strong></p>
<p><span>Async video meetings are all about optimizing your team’s time, and they are a great way to get information in front of people who don’t have availability for a meeting, or who are working remotely across multiple time zones. When you work in the way I do,having time to think on and internalize information before acting is critical.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of coordinating schedules, opt to send a quick async video with key info that your remote colleagues can view during normal work hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronous communication allows people to first absorb and then act on information when they are able to, rather than the moment a piece of information is put in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are my 5 beliefs to embrace this new world&nbsp; :&nbsp;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>1. The remote worker is FREE, completely FREE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Your employees are working remotely, they decide where and when. They are working from their personal environment, so you don’t oversee how they want to manage their time and where they can or want work. You don’t offer them a work environment anymore so you have to admit that you also lost this power.</span></p>
<p><span>If an employee wants to work from 5am and go hiking or kayaking by 2pm, he can do that!! Why not? Trust me, he will be much more productive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about children: When you are working from home, you are sharing the same family space and property. You cannot ask them everyday “Please be quiet, Iwill be on a zoom meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously!! I am sure this generation will hate zoom meetings. They are synonyms to online school and now“mom and dad are not available”! You are physically here but not really here, it’s difficult for our loved ones. We need to take that in consideration and not impose our timing on others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I encourage your people to work the hours that suit them and their lives, in the middle of what is a stressful time for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>I think we need to be more respectful of each other’s time and not interrupt with alive meeting each time we need it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to be more respectful of each others’ home life: We enter each other’s personal space. It’s why weet captures a small portion of your background and you can even blur it.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>2. The remote worker is MORE PRODUCTIVE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>With asynchronous communication you allow yourself – or your employees – to put all energy into what you do each time and have better control over your workload.</span></p>
<p><span>In workplaces where asynchronous collaboration is reinforced and enabled with technology, productivity is higher. People can follow their agenda and complete daily tasks more easily when they are able respond to their colleagues’ requests based on bandwidth or set up time slots throughout the week to prepare feedback for specific projects. Plus, by focusing their attention on one task at a time they have a more detailed look and bring in better results.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>3. Working remotely = HUMAN &amp; EMOTION</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>It’s important to keep a human and emotional connection with our team and clients even if we cannot see them in person. I personally attach great importance to emotional communication where I can see facial expressions, hear a warm voice, and feel others’ mood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot can be lost in translation in writing, including empathy, body and facial language, and often the attention of the reader when it’s a long note.</span></p>
<p><span>Async videos accomplish a number of things that emails or text chat cannot. They create more of a human connection, which makes it easier to understand each other and makes it clear to the recipient that the ideas being shared are well understood. Async meetings are ideal for giving feedback, because empathy comes through much more clearly when you can see face-to-face or hear a warm voice.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll be surprised by the power of emojis in a video or just how a voice tonality can say a lot!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every person is different and some are not comfortable with the camera. For this reason, we offer the capability to&nbsp; record without the camera but we always show a profile picture in all the videos: It’s a good way to keep a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span>And Weet offers the ability to add filters on your webcam to create a fun environment&nbsp; and make your teammates smile 😉</span></p>
<p><span>We also discovered that&nbsp; async video gives a voice to those who are quieter. Contributing to live meetings can often rely on speaking skills of speed and volume, while async videos let people share their thoughts at their own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>While some people prefer reacting spontaneously others need time to think and video recordings accommodate both approaches to produce a clear “leave-behind” that allows everyone to review feedback at their own speed. </span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>4. STOP CHAT &amp; LONG MEETINGS</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Working remotely equals working alone. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to concentrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever found it difficult to concentrate on your daily job duties after being interrupted by an unexpected casual chit-chat about a project your colleague is working on? It’s fine if this happens sometimes because mutual support and camaraderie is a critical part of being a team. But what if it interferes with your productivity?</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid being interrupted and interrupted for just asking a question.&nbsp; Divide your time between working time and communicating time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/"><span>Recent research</span></a><span> has shown that we live in a more collaborative era; We schedule our working day around meetings, Slack conversations and emails with our colleagues and sometimes these events could take up </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload"><span>80% of a full working day</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be detrimental to our performance; Technically we spend more time hopping from one meeting to another or replying to messages than focusing solely and mindfully on our tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I shut down all my notifications and connect only 4 times in the day to check my emails and my weets. What is great is that if someone needs to ask me a question and would need to do it in a live meeting, he can record it and I answer when I am available. You cannot imagine the freedom that it gives me and above all, the time I gain!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why async video meetings are so effective : We talk faster than we type and we retain more information when delivery is via video. Plus people can review recorded videos at their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to make a clarification : I am not saying to cut off all the live meetings (at least 2/3) but for those that are necessary, put 30min max in your agenda settings. It seems sometimes too short but you will see people will accomodate.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><span>2020 has been a challenging year, no doubt. But one thing is clear – the way we have adapted will inform how we work for years to come, empowering us all to do the best work of our lives. Allowing people to work at a time and a pace that suits them is key to this.</span></p>
<p><span>In this new remote world, we can hire anywhere in the globe. Embracing async collaboration allows companies to access a wider range of candidates and freelancers all around the world;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><b>5 tips to embrace async video meetings :&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>1- the most important: Emphasize trust, organization &amp; independence: Evaluate people based on their results, not the number of hours spent online or number of emails.</span></p>
<p><span>2 – Be cool with the video as a media: Not everyone is comfortable with a camera, communicate that it’s ok to cut off the webcam. You are not looking for perfection, just authenticity; Your employees can record their video as they talk in a real conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>3 – Create an async culture mindset: Explain how it works, share the benefits, share some examples and ask top management to begin by creating some enthusiastic video messages and above all, share that in async communication, we don’t wait for an immediate answer.</span></p>
<p><span>4 – Ask your employees and teammates for feedback: Does it work? What are their feelings?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5 – Minimize the number of meetings you have, but don’t blacklist them.&nbsp; The async work communication stack looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><span>80% async video </span></p>
<p><span>15% live video meetings </span></p>
<p><span>5% physical meetings, e.g., annual company or team retreats</span></p>

<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>

									<a href="https://julian.digital/2020/12/03/banking-on-status/" target="_blank">
										Banking on Status									</a>
									 &nbsp;by Julian Lehr									<br>
								</h5>
								
								<p>
									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<p><span>Julian wrote “</span><a href="https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/"><span>Signaling-as-a-Service</span></a><span>” back in March 2020 (which I highly recommend reading) that dove deep into many aspects of signaling. In this piece however, he outlines the mix between signaling and neobanks.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, Julian believes signaling explains our everyday lives, “what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A Rolex isn’t any better at telling time than a cheaper watch. However, a Rolex signals status and wealth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Most of us know traditional banks such as Chase and Wells Fargo, however, there’s a less traditional kind of bank called a neobank:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Neobanks are entirely managed via an app&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank card holders are the equivalent to the kids that sit at the cool-kids-table. Many of the neobanks feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies, Julian mentions.</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank premium subscriptions come with nicer looking cards: </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/"><span>titanium</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.treecard.org/"><span>wood</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832"><span>glow-in-the-dark yellow</span></a><span>, </span><span><a href="https://n26.com/en-de/metal">N26</a>,</span><span> or </span><a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/revolut-metal"><span>Revolut Metal</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Some neobank cards have no credit card number on the front. “[Making it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.” — Julian Lehr</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A main point in Julian’s piece is that on in-groups and out-groups. Every signaling scenario has those two possible audiences. “The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Think iMessages blue text messages vs. Android’s green text messages.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Here are two ways to increase the signaling power of an out-group:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Raise prices</span></li>
<li><span>Create artificial scarcity&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Have a larger out-group who is aware of the in-group and vice versa</span></li>
</ol>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: Neobanks aren’t as talked about as much as people think. Maybe it’s because I’m not sitting at the cool kids table. A friend of mine got a titanium Apple credit card and would “accidentally” drop it on the table before handing it over to the waiter. Of course, it would make a significantly louder noise than my battered-plastic card. Signaling can take many forms. </span></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p><img height="269" width="268" data-delta="1" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/Libbie-Mills-IMG_1510-1-300s.jpg" alt="Libbie Mills"></p><p><strong>Libbie Mills</strong>, an assistant professor in the department for the study of religion in the University of Toronto’s&nbsp;Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, noticed something interesting this fall in her introductory Sanskrit class: computer science students.

</p>

<p>The course typically attracts students majoring in the study of religion, who are learning the language to further their research into Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Reading through her class list, however, Mills found that of six of the 40 enrolled students were actually computer science majors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm always excited when there are students from an unexpected place,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lingual connection between Sanskrit and computer science, it turns out, has been the subject of interest for quite some time. The first well-known publication that examined the relationship was in 1985, when NASA scientist&nbsp;Rick Briggs&nbsp;published a research paper in which he argued that the 3,500-year-old language was the best candidate for programming artificial intelligence technology&nbsp;– namely because of its adherence to rigid grammatical rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Thomas</strong>, a fourth-year undergraduate student at St. Michael’s College who plans on majoring in computer science next year, says he&nbsp;has a proclivity for learning languages, but ultimately took the course because of its connection to coding.</p>

<p>“Sanskrit is a very computational language,” he explains. “It’s a lot of syntax, which is the structure of programming itself. Classical Sanskrit is an engineered language.”</p>

<p>There are nearly 4,000 rules&nbsp;recorded in the fourth&nbsp;century BCE grammar of Pāṇini, an ancient scholar of the language&nbsp;– and&nbsp;Mill’s approach to teaching it is methodical.</p>

<p>“I'm a nerd” she says. “I like mathy type things, and I teach in a bit of a sciencey way.”</p>

<p>She stresses to her students that this is not a typical language class, where after a few classes they’ll be able to casually practise what they have learned over coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s not conversational, there’s too much to learn at the beginning,” she says. “They must learn the characters&nbsp;and how words get put together. It’s mind-bogglingly awful at first.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She starts with what she calls the building blocks&nbsp;–&nbsp;“the order of sounds we produce out of our mouths ... from the throat to palate to teeth to lips” –&nbsp;and enthuses over the “tidiness of the language”, where a few root words are the basis of the entire Sanskrit vocabulary.</p>

<p>“It's orderly,” Mills says. “If you know the systems for making words you can work backward&nbsp;to the root to understand the meaning of the word. It’s creative in an organized way. It is kind of amazing.”</p>

<p>Mills adds that she&nbsp;understands the affinity that computer programmers have with the language. “It’s good coding,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Thomas, the strict grammatical rules of Sanskrit&nbsp;align well&nbsp;with the goals of computer programmers who are ultimately interested in the “question of how to create interface between computers and human languages.”&nbsp; He maintains that Sanskrit is well positioned to do so because of its algorithmic foundation. “Computers don’t understand linguistics, they understand rules,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the rigidity of Sanskrit makes it less likely that an artificial intelligence algorithm would misinterpret commands. The same can’t&nbsp;be said of a language like English, which is&nbsp;looser with its rules and where words have multiple meanings.</p>

<p>“In English, there are so many influences from different language streams,” Mills says. “It’s kind of a mess.”&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>

<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war.

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

	<div>
		<p>As Europe and the United States are experiencing a second or third wave of the pandemic, depending on how you count, the debate about lockdowns is raging again. Many people are convinced they are the best way to deal with the pandemic until a vaccine arrives. Back in the Spring, I argued in favor of lockdowns because we didn’t know much about the virus and Western governments were caught by surprise (I’m not even sure I was right anymore, even when you don’t look at things in retrospect with the information we now have, but that’s a question for another day), but now I think we should not resort to them anymore. The main reason is that, after looking at the data we have accumulated in the past few months, I have come to believe that lockdowns weren’t as effective as most people think relative to less stringent restrictions. People seem to believe that lockdowns are the only kind of policy that can prevent a colossal loss of life, because less stringent restrictions just don’t cut transmission enough. They also say a lot of things about lockdowns, especially about their effects on the economy, which I think are false, but in this post I want to focus on the claim that only lockdowns are really effective to cut transmission and ultimately prevent a lot of people from dying.</p>
<p>Whenever someone makes that claim, you can be certain they will cite the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7" rel="nofollow">paper</a> Flaxman et al. published in <em>Nature</em> a few months ago, which concluded that non-pharmaceutical interventions had saved more than 3 millions lives in Europe in the Spring and that among those interventions only lockdowns had a substantial effect. This paper went viral when it was published and continues to be cited all the time as proof that lockdowns saved countless lives during the first wave. This isn’t just true in informal discussions, but also in the scientific literature, where this paper is systematically cited to support the claim that lockdowns are very effective. (It’s already been cited almost 450 times since it was published a few months ago.) I hadn’t read it until very recently, but since the debate about lockdown has been rekindled by the second wave in Europe, I decided to read it and I was astonished by how bad it was. Since it still plays a very important role in that debate, I think it’s important to explain why it’s bad, so in this post I’m going to take it apart and explain why even Flaxman et al.’s own analysis shows that, while lockdowns do make a difference, they don’t cut transmission that much more than other, less stringent and therefore less costly restrictions. (I basically taught myself Stan over a weekend to do this, so someone should probably check my <a href="https://github.com/phl43/flaxman-lockdowns-analysis" rel="nofollow">code</a>, though I’m pretty sure there are no major mistakes.) After pointing out that it changes the policy debate quite a lot, I conclude with a few remarks about the role bad science has played in this debate and how this paper illustrates why the cult of science that many people have fallen into is bad.</p>
<p><strong>What Flaxman et al. did</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen many people claim that Flaxman et al.’s paper showed that lockdowns were very effective, but I don’t think many of them know what they actually did in that paper, because it showed no such thing despite what the authors claim. In fact, what they did is assume that non-pharmaceutical interventions work (as we shall see, the model was bound to find that lockdowns specifically did most of the work, but more on that later), fit the data on deaths to a model that makes this assumption in order to infer various epidemiological variables of interest such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t"> and the number of infections. Once this was done, they just compared the number of deaths predicted by this model, which by construction is going to be very close to the actual number of deaths, to the number of deaths in a counterfactual where there were no interventions. I will come back to this counterfactual, but first I want to say more about what this model, because it will be important to understand why this paper doesn’t show what Flaxman et al. claim it shows.</p>
<p>Here is the equation they use to model the true number of infections:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png" alt="" width="1986" height="890" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png 1986w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-300x134.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1024x459.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-768x344.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1536x688.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1986px) 100vw, 1986px"></a>It’s basically a discrete version of the SIR model, the most basic model of epidemiology. Don’t worry if mathematical symbols scare you, what it says is just that, on any given day, the number of people who get infected depends on the number of people who got infected previously and are still infectious, when they were infected, as well as on the reproduction number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">, which is the average number of people that a person who is infected goes on to infect.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions affect the number of infections through their effect on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">. Here is how they model the way in which those interventions affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png" alt="" width="1996" height="1362" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png 1996w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-300x205.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-1024x699.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-768x524.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-1536x1048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px"></a>Again, it’s not a big deal if you don’t understand everything, what you need to remember is that each non-pharmaceutical intervention is assumed to affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t"> immediately, only non-pharmaceutical interventions are supposed to affect it&nbsp;and each is assumed to have the same effect in every country where it’s implemented.</p>
<p>Many people have criticized the first assumption, but while it’s no doubt unrealistic, the second and third assumptions seem even worse. Indeed, it’s obvious that even in the absence of any government interventions, people would still change their behavior in response to the pandemic because they’re afraid. This would reduce transmission and therefore it’s not true that only non-pharmaceutical interventions affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">. Moreover, there is also no doubt that each non-pharmaceutical intervention is not equally effective in every country where it’s implemented, so it’s not true that each intervention has the same effect in every country. First, although various restrictions are modeled as the same in the paper, they were actually pretty different. For instance, the intervention that Flaxman et al. call “public events banned” consisted in forbidding gatherings of more than 5 people in Austria, 100 people in France, 500 people in Sweden and 1,000 people in Germany, but in the model all those different policies are treated as identical. Indeed, even “lockdown” was not the same thing everywhere, since under “lockdown” people in France couldn’t leave their place without filling a form while in Denmark people could meet as long as they were no more than 10.</p>
<p>Not only very different interventions are treated as the same in the model, but even if they had really been identical, their effect in different countries would still have been different for idiosyncratic reasons. Everybody has noted how people in some cultures might be more willing to follow rules, but there are many other possible factors that could also affect how effective the same intervention would be in different countries, such as differences in the proportion of people who need to take public transportation to go to work, differences in the age distribution of the population, etc. As you can see above, Flaxman et al. did include a country-specific effect in the model, which is supposed to model the fact that, precisely for this kind of idiosyncratic reasons, we don’t expect that even the same non-pharmaceutical interventions will be equally effective in every country. I will come back to this country-specific effect later, because it plays a very important and largely unacknowledged role in Flaxman et al.’s paper, but for the moment it’s enough to say that it’s only associated with the last intervention, which is a lockdown in every country except in Sweden where it’s the ban of public events. So the model only acknowledges that idiosyncratic factors could affect how effective the same interventions are in different countries for lockdowns but not for the other interventions.</p>
<p>Another problem with the model is that it assumes the population of each country is homogenous, which is undoubtedly false and might result in getting the dynamic of the epidemic wrong even in the early phase, though as I have <a title="Let’s have a honest debate about “herd immunity”" href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/lets-have-a-honest-debate-about-herd-immunity/" rel="">discussed</a> before we don’t really know. (Some people seem to think that, since I wrote this, various things have shown that the naive model was correct, but they are confused. However, there is only so much you can talk about in one post, so perhaps I will revisit that issue some other time.) I just mention that issue because I think it’s important and people should try to model heterogeneity more often, if only as a robustness check, but I won’t be focusing on that in the rest of this post because we don’t know how much it matters and, even if heterogeneity actually had a large effect on the dynamic of the epidemic and the final attack rate, I think not modeling it would mostly affect their counterfactual and not their estimates of the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>Finally, they don’t fit their model on data about cases, but instead assume a particular infection fatality rate for each country and use this plus the infection-to-death distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\pi" title="\pi"> to work backward from data on deaths and&nbsp;infer the number of infections over time. (The infection fatality rates they use are derived from Verity et al.’s <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30243-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow">paper</a> and adjusted for each country based on age-specific mixing patterns.) To be more specific, they assume that the reported daily number of deaths in a country <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" title="m"> follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $latex d_{t,m}, which they modeled like this:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png" alt="" width="1962" height="436" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png 1962w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-300x67.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1024x228.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-768x171.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1536x341.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1962px) 100vw, 1962px"></a>Again, don’t worry if you don’t understand everything, what’s important is just that you understand that Flaxman et al. assume a particular infection fatality rate and a distribution of the delay between infection and death (both of which are estimated from data collected early in the pandemic), which they use to infer the daily number of infections during the period they consider by working backward from the data on deaths. This is a good idea because, while data on deaths are hardly perfect, there are definitely more reliable than data on cases, which are a mess.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll go back to the model …</p></div></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.community.com/">Community</a> we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, a lot. It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>
<span># Usually it looks like: "caller_service.#{UUID.generate()}"</span>
<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Queue</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>auto_delete:</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Basic</span><span>.</span><span>consume</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a response comes back, the caller does a key lookup on the response’s request ID in the in-memory key-value data store to retrieve the original request and moreover the process that’s waiting on the response. It looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>handle_rabbitmq_message</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>decode!</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>caller_process</span> <span>=</span> <span>KVStore</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>re…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <section>  <section> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction"></a></h2>  <p>I’m Sebastian McKenzie, the creator of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

</figure></div></div>

<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/no-escape-from-our-techno-feudal-world/">Asia Times</a>.</em></p>
<p>The political economy of the Digital Age remains virtually terra incognita. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technof%C3%A9odalisme-French-C%C3%A9dric-DURAND-ebook/dp/B08GS8XV47/ref=pd_ybh_a_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=ZCPCTPFZXYQBGGRPBDH3">Techno-Feudalism</a>, published three months ago in France (no English translation yet), <strong>Cedric Durand,</strong> an economist at the Sorbonne, provides a crucial, global public service as he sifts through the new Matrix that controls all our lives.</p>
<p>Durand places the Digital Age in the larger context of the historical evolution of capitalism to show how the Washington consensus ended up metastasized into the Silicon Valley consensus. In a delightful twist, he brands the new grove as the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>We’re far away from Jefferson Airplane and the Beach Boys; it’s more like Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” on steroids, complete with IMF-style “structural reforms” emphasizing “flexibilization” of work and  outright marketization/financialization of everyday life.</p>
<p>The Digital Age was crucially associated with right-wing ideology from the very start. The incubation was provided by the <a href="http://www.pff.org/">Progress and Freedom Foundation (PFF)</a>, active from 1993 to 2010 and conveniently funded, among others, by Microsoft, At&amp;T, Disney, Sony, Oracle, Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>In 1994, PFF held a ground-breaking conference in Atlanta that eventually led to a seminal Magna Carta: literally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39342741-cyberspace-and-the-american-dream">Cyberspace and the American Dream: a Magna Carta for the Knowledge Era</a>, published in 1996, during the first Clinton term.</p>
<p>Not by accident the magazine <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired </a>was founded, just like PFF, in 1993, instantly becoming the house organ of the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>Among the authors of the Magna Carta we find futurist <a href="https://www.tofflerassociates.com/about/the-toffler-legacy/">Alvin “Future Shock” Toffler</a> and Reagan’s former scientific counselor George Keyworth. Before anyone else, they were already conceptualizing how “cyberspace is a bioelectronic environment which is literally universal”. Their Magna Carta was the privileged road map to explore the new frontier.</p>
<p><strong>Those Randian heroes</strong></p>
<p>Also not by accident the intellectual guru of the new frontier was Ayn Rand and her quite primitive dichotomy between “pioneers” and the mob. Rand declared that egotism is good, altruism is evil, and empathy is irrational.</p>
<p>When it comes to the new property rights of the new Eldorado, all power should be exercised by the Silicon Valley “pioneers”, a Narcissus bunch in love with their mirror image as superior Randian heroes. In the name of innovation they should be allowed to destroy any established rules, in a Schumpeterian “creative destruction” rampage.</p>
<p>That has led to our current environment, where Google, Facebook, Uber and co. can overstep any legal framework, imposing their innovations like a <em>fait accompli</em>.</p>
<p>Durand goes to the heart of the matter when it comes to the true nature of “digital domination”: US leadership was never achieved because of spontaneous market forces.</p>
<p>On the contrary. The history of Silicon Valley is absolutely dependent on state intervention – especially via the industrial-military complex and the aero-spatial complex. The Ames Research Center, one of NASA’s top labs, is in Mountain View. Stanford was always awarded juicy military research contracts. During WWII, Hewlett Packard, for instance, was flourishing thanks to their electronics being used to manufacture radars. Throughout the 1960s, the US military bought the bulk of the still infant semiconductor production.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/21/161487/the-rise-of-data-capital/"><em>The Rise of Data Capital</em></a><em>, </em>a 2016 MIT Technological Review report produced “in partnership” with Oracle, showed how digital networks open access to a new, virgin underground brimming with resources: “Those that arrive first and take control obtain the resources they’re seeking” – in the form of data.</p>
<p>So everything from video-surveillance images and electronic banking to DNA samples and supermarket tickets implies some form of territorial appropriation. Here we see in all its glory the extractivist logic inbuilt in the development of Big Data.</p>
<p>Durand gives us the example of Android to illustrate the extractivist logic in action. Google made Android free for all smartphones so it would acquire a strategic market position, beating the Apple ecosystem and thus becoming the default internet entry point for virtually the whole planet. That’s how a de facto, immensely valuable,  online real estate empire is built.</p>
<p>The key point is that whatever the original business – Google, Amazon, Uber – strategies of conquering cyberspace all point to the same target: take control of “spaces of observation and capture” of data.</p>
<p><strong>About the Chinese credit system…</strong></p>
<p>Durand offers a finely balanced analysis of the Chinese credit system – a public/private hybrid system launched in 2013 during the 3<sup>rd</sup> plenum of the 18<sup>th</sup> Congress of the CCP, under the motto “to value sincerity and punish insincerity”.</p>
<p>For the State Council, the supreme government authority in China, what really mattered was to encourage behavior deemed responsible in the financial, economic and socio-political spheres, and sanction what is not. It’s all about trust. Beijing defines it as “a method of perfecting the socialist market economy system that improves social governance”.</p>
<p>The Chinese term – <em>shehui xinyong</em> – is totally lost in translation in the West. Way more complex than “social credit”, it’s more about  “trustworthiness”, in the sense of integrity. Instead of the pedestrian Western accusations of being an Orwellian system, priorities include the fight against fraud and corruption at the national, regional and local levels, violations of environmental rules, disrespect of food security norms.</p>
<p>Cybernetic management of social life is being seriously discussed in China since the 1980s. In fact, since the 1940s, as we see in Mao’s <em>Little Red Book</em>. It could be seen as inspired by the Maoist principle of “mass lines”, as in “start with the masses to come back to the masses: to amass the ideas of the masses (which are dispersed, non-systematic), concentrate them (in general ideas and systematic), then come back to the masses to diffuse and explain them, make sure the masses assimilate them and translate them into action, and verify in the action of the masses the pertinence of these ideas”.</p>
<p><strong>Durand’s analysis goes one step beyond Soshana Zuboff’s</strong></p>
<p><em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> when he finally reaches the core of his thesis, showing how digital platforms become “fiefdoms”: they live out of, and profit from, their vast “digital territory” peopled with data even as they lock in power over their services, which are deemed indispensable.</p>
<p>And just as in feudalism, fiefdoms dominate territory by attaching serfs. Masters made their living profiting from the social power derived from the exploitation of their domain, and that implied unlimited power over the serfs.</p>
<p>It all spells out total concentration. Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel has always stressed the target of the digital entrepreneur is exactly to bypass competition. As quoted in <em>Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World</em>, Thiel declared, “Capitalism and competition are antagonistic. Competition is for losers.”</p>
<p>So now we are facing not a mere clash between Silicon Valley capitalism and finance capital, but actually a new mode of production:</p>
<p>a turbo-capitalist survival as rentier capitalism, where Silicon giants take the place of estates, and also the State. That is the “techno-feudal” option, as defined by Durand.</p>
<p><strong>Blake meets Burroughs</strong></p>
<p>Durand’s book is extremely relevant to show how the theoretical and political critique of the Digital Age is still rarified. There is no precise cartography of all those dodgy circuits of revenue extraction. No analysis of how do they profit from the financial casino – especially mega investment funds that facilitate hyper-concentration. Or how do they profit from the hardcore exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The total concentration of the digital glebe is leading to a scenario, as Durand recalls, already dreamed up by Stuart Mill, where every land in a country belonged to a single master. Our generalized dependency on the digital masters seems to be “the cannibal future of liberalism in the age of algorithms”.</p>
<p>Is there a possible way out? The temptation is to go radical – a Blake/Burroughs crossover. We have to expand our scope of comprehension – and stop confusing the map (as shown in the Magna Carta) with the territory (our perception).</p>
<p>William Blake, in his proto-psychedelic visions, was all about liberation and subordination – depicting an authoritarian deity imposing conformity via a sort of source code of mass influence. Looks like a proto-analysis of the Digital Age.</p>
<p>William Burroughs conceptualized Control – an array of manipulations including mass media (he would be horrified by social media). To break down Control, we must be able to hack into and disrupt its core programs. Burroughs showed how all forms of Control must be rejected – and defeated: “Authority figures are seen for what they are:  dead empty masks manipulated by computers”.</p>
<p>Here’s our future: hackers or slaves.</p>

<p><em>Gender inequality</em> examples are all around us, and we learn to recognize them from a very early age. However, most cases based on differences between men and women usually praise <em>one</em> side while undermining the other. Female developers enter into this problem reluctantly, being an ever-present target for inequality proponents.</p>
<p>We want to believe that gender should not be a discriminative factor in IT, and the sooner everyone accepts this realization, the better we look in the eyes of our future selves.<br>A quick look at how women rank in the tech business shows us how vulnerable companies are to gender-based attacks. At Facebook and Apple, most employees are men. The same goes for Microsoft and Google. Is the IT industry going to stay a man’s domain?<br>Although the IT Industry feels the man-to-women ratio discrepancy, it is not a strictly IT-related problem. In fact, all other sectors <em>except manufacturing</em> are all man dominated.</p>

<p>A GAO report from 2015 suggests that a little over one-third of people working in the tech sector are female in the US. Even though the discrepancy gap between gender has been evening out since the 80s, gender issues are still stagnating the market with equal opportunities demands of all nature.<br>The number of female software engineer graduates ready to enter the workforce is even lower than the number of total employed women in the sector, which shows that they are somewhat reluctant to pursue a career in this domain. Even more — nearly half of the women who graduate as certified engineers choose not to enter the industry market as coders. Most females from the IT industry prefer more creative positions like <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/ui-ux-design-explained">graphics</a></strong> or fashion designers.<br>Some might suggest that coding is hard for girls, which mostly deters them from taking this path. However, there is a lot more ingredients brewing in the pot. And besides, software development is <strong>not exactly rocket science</strong>. Female working in high tech is under the constant umbrella of possible male repression and the fear of being undermined. Gender inequality claims and conditions are prerequisites for creating a very unhealthy work environment and navigating around them, sometimes facing the facts straight away.<br>We believe the female contribution to software development and the way it changes and improves is undeniable. The fact that gender inequality factors sustain a <em>dogma</em> in the business world is what some female programmers recognize as motivating factors. We strongly encourage all girls interested in software engineering to pursue their dream because very soon, all traces of discomfort coming due to inequality will be a thing in the past.<br>Let’s look at some concrete reasons why women may feel threatened while impacting the tech industry.</p>
<h2>Feeling like a stranger in your own yard</h2>
<p>During college and her first year on the job, Maria shared that she felt like an <em>alien</em>. She was repeatedly asked about her <em>qualifications</em> and peppered with comments on her excellent dress style and <em>neat appearance</em>. They even used a loud pitch to inquire about here future planning on family and children.<br>Such experience comes with an initial shock, Maria said. She decided to <em>desensitize</em> herself from this disturbance and focus on picking up <em>skills</em> quickly. She learned how to rise above obstacles and familiarized herself with strong male rivals, as well as a horde of competition from the same gender. These initial struggles were very challenging, but she eventually learned how to better promote her accomplishments and successes.<br>Nowadays, Maria is an intrapreneur working for <em>Samsung</em>. She quickly adapted to the male ruled world of IT and learned how to be excellent at it.</p>
<h2>Why women leave</h2>
<p>Maria was motivated to succeed, but as we mentioned before, many women in <strong>software engineering</strong> decide to move to industries outside the tech domain shortly after getting their first job. We are not busting a myth here. Evidence is abundant for the fact that most of all high-ranked employees are men.<br>Part of the reason can be the already discussed reluctance of women to become software engineers. It is almost normal to see young female developers leaving their current job and switching to a different career path.<br>We know that the role of women in technology use and development is somewhat under-represented. However, it’s much more essential to recognize the need for more women to engage in activities previously associated with men stereotypes. History is rich in examples of women with stellar minds and determination. We have collectively allowed for a working environment that admits discrimination. Gender-based factors are both powerful arguments as well as liability for all parties involved. They sometimes cause damage and eventually delay our progress.<br>Companies that are more gender-neutral in their approach towards employees and businesses create a friendly ecosystem where professionals work closely with each other and learn ways to optimize their collective output as a team.<br>In contrast, <strong>gender discrimination</strong> is a recipe for a toxic work environment with seriously undermined potential. The value of any <em>Men’s club</em> is denominating with each passing day. We must be smart and quickly acknowledge gender discrimination as something we need <em>to put in our calendars</em>.<br>Of course, if too much energy goes into denouncing some of the patriarchy-based business models, the opposite effect is due. We can see the impact in companies whose mission is to turn their female employees into relentless business warriors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to understand that if we all work on inclusion together, it’s going to be faster, broader, better, and more thorough than anything we can do on our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former Reddit CEO + Current Co-Founder of Project Include</p>
</div>
<h2>Focus on belief</h2>
<p>The level of confidence of women has very much detrimental to their success rate. One such woman brings the statistical part of gender distribution in the workforce to another level — she created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxbEifUr1z6HwY2_IcExQwUpKPRZY3FZ4x4ZFzZU-5E/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spreadsheet with about 80 different companies</a> and their man/women employee ratio. I’m very eager to point out that these numbers represent not <em>all the women</em> in a company, but <em>all the women who are software engineers.</em> This spreadsheet is a fine example of how science can help us use data to better deal with a century-old problem.<br>Women are fully equipped <em>to do well in IT</em>. Sara Gottlieb proves that a strong belief is at the base of success. She is the software engineer behind <em>SurveyMonkey</em>. Sara is an excellent software engineer who decided she didn’t have enough on her plate already and started learning more about <strong>engineering management</strong>. Not long after that, she became a recognized mentor in Hackbright Academy, teaching programming classes to other women.<br>Focus on belief is a powerful success tool, significantly when others recognize it and support it. Joyce Jang was encouraged by both men and women in her company to pursue her career advancement. Having a lady in high positions is excellent makes the real difference. It also sets a healthy pace for all men. </p>
<h2>Less Shy, More Direct</h2>
<p>Caroline Tess, a VP, has been trapped under a male dominance sea before realizing her best card. She says that when making a conversation, she tries to stay as clear and assertive as possible while maintaining directness and presence. Speaking up, especially when you have a valid argument, helps understand your work potential and your identity as a professional. Speak up and be heard!<br>Women are somewhat less competitive than the testosterone-driven men, who are creative enough to turn anything into a fierce competition. Women are less likely to demand recognition or honor but just as <em>equally entitled to it</em>.<br>Joyce Stack, an engineer advocate in Mendeley, says the best recommendation for women and visitors to surrender is to ask for something acceptable to them. It is what Stack did to get a major position in programming testing. “After the meeting, they asked the spot if there were any additional inquiries, and I requested this activity.” “Because you are considering it, no one will give you anything. You need to open your mouth and question.”</p>
<h2>Find a coach or a supporter</h2>
<p>Ladies looking to ascend the career ladder and reach leadership positions line up with male <em>and</em> female coaches and supporters.<br>Maria perceived the significance of having a coach right off the bat. It kept on searching them out all through her profession, remembering for her developer functions at eBay and Microsoft. Besides, she established a versatile web-based media stage Flockish and Anecdote, an inventive photograph network bought by Samsung.<br>She claims that your guide can’t be an arbitrary person.<br><em>“You need to discover somebody that acknowledges you and your abilities,</em>”<br>she clarifies.<br><em>“Your mentor better be a senior who can convey their knowledge and perspective.”</em><br><em>“That is the secret to escaping a reality where work becomes more of a minefield than a healthy environment for personal and professional development.”</em></p>
<h2>Talk to Female Role Models</h2>
<p>Women continue to prove they can lead and be excellent role models – most examples from history ring true even today. The world’s top female developers now are just as stellar as those <a href="https://wiredelta.com/the-history-of-women-in-software-and-programming/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">from our not so distant past</a>. Creating a LinkedIn profile and contacting other female software engineers is an incredible way to strengthen your network and widen advancement opportunities. Start a discussion with a female professional and share some views about your personal experience and professional interests. You will be amazed at the freedom and openness level when it comes to getting help from peers.</p>
<h2>Be Bold for Change</h2>
<p>The International Women’s Day is bringing awareness with the <strong>#BeBoldForChange</strong>. Change happens when we get to work in full swing. We urge you to learn improvement, attend tech opportunities, work tirelessly, value yourself, and be confident in fulfilling your potential. </p>

December 7, 2020 | https://billisfun.com/blog/10-Culture-Lessons-from-Tony-Hsieh | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://billisfun.com/blog/10-Culture-Lessons-from-Tony-Hsieh">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main><p>Personally, I didn't know Tony or his previous history until my Tweeter feed got filled with the sad news about his death. It took me some time to learn more about Tony and his impact on our world today. After doing my research, I came to a conclusion: most of the companies today are totally missing out on creating a strong team culture. So, here are some key things that I was able to extract from numerous interviews and talks with Mr. Hsieh.</p><h2>What is your bad culture experience?</h2><p>Before Zappos, Tony was running a startup called LinkExchange. It was sold to Microsoft. Tony's reason for the exit was bad team culture. Tony admitted to this, and used it as a motivation to create a great team culture at Zappos. You can think about your own bad employee experience. What sucked for you at your first job? Perhaps you still have similar problems at your current company. Can you find a fix for them?</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff1d3c31c-1fcf-4309-b409-96d87ba41b57%2Fgift-habeshaw-Of8C-QHqagM-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dc1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=c1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Focus on your employees as much as on your customers.</h2><p>Don't forget that people who are on-board with your vision have their own dreams and aspirations. Try to think of ways you can make their job more enjoyable. For example, Zappos employees claim that they make decisions on their own. How great does that sound?</p><h2>Give Freedom to your employees.</h2><p>No micromanager will admit they micromanage. Maybe you should always assume that there's some micromanagement involved. So how will you create the type of environment where your team doesn't get told what to do yet still  achieves needed results? At Zappos, Tony was able to create this atmosphere. The customer support team doesn't have scripts. Their whole aim is to help people. They act based on principles and not direct tasks.</p><h2>Your focus should be your customer not your product.</h2><p>While Zappos started as an online shoe store, Tony said that they want to be much bigger than that. At the core of his company he preached to focus on customer and satisfy their needs instead of improving the product. At Zappos, the whole strategy was to ignore advertising as their growth channel and instead think about how customer service can be improved. This approach led to great sales results and mutual understanding inside of Zappos on what matters.</p><h2>Think creatively about your hiring.</h2><p>Zappos hires based on 2 fits. Fit for the hiring position and fit for the culture. After an interviewee is determined to be a great fit, Zappos offers them something very intriguing. A new hire has a chance to get paid for the training, plus a $3000 bonus if they reject the hiring offer. That way the people who accept the job feel more committed. Only about 2-3 percent of people take that offer. It's a great bargain for the company to onboard people who are there for the right reason and not just a paycheck. </p><h2>Don't start a brand, start a philosophy.</h2><p>The Zappos team created a set of 3 things that are essential for the brand: <b>Clothing, Customer Service, Culture. </b>By putting it all together, they have realized that Zappos is about <b>delivering happiness</b>. That's a genius way to distill your mission.</p><blockquote>“People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them <b>feel</b>”</blockquote><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0f41dc6c-adcd-40ca-ab18-1b4ce5cad667%2Flex-sirikiat-YlHhljkuEFE-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Hire, promote, and fire based on culture values not on performance.</h2><p>It's up to you to decide what your company values are, but you should have them set. For Zappos, one of them is being humble. Turns out it's not easy to ask people about this value while hiring. The response won't be very accurate. To fix this issue, Zappos came up with a pretty smart way to uncover the truth. Since a lot of job applicants are out of town, Zappos hires a driver that picks them up from the airport. After the interview done, a driver is asked how the job applicant was treating them. If the driver says "bad", it doesn't even matter how good the interview was.</p><h2>Core values don't matter, committing to them does.</h2><p>Tony said that he took this idea from nature by looking at flying birds. As they fly they look like one organism. Birds do have very simple rules while traveling. Have some distance from the bird to the left, have some distance from the bird to the right. They are not guided by one main bird that tells them what to do. Those simple rules are just like your company culture principles. Commit to them and your team will be united. That's how Zappos was able to scale their team culture.</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe8254a5a-318a-475d-98ed-82ba113c641d%2Fvincent-van-zalinge-fiQ7YrVFPqs-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3De99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=e99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Chase the vision not the money.</h2><p>Even though it might sound obvious, Tony is very convinced about this idea. He was often being asked about what industry to enter to make a giant pile of money. This response was standard. Focus on problems and customers that you like the most. Money will follow. After selling his first startup, he was able to invest in dozens of startups. It was his choice to join Zappos. Without his love for the customer service, he wouldn't achieve such result. </p><blockquote>“Don't chase the paper- chase the dream” — P. Diddy</blockquote><h2>Rediscover your Happiness.</h2><p>Even though Tony left the world on a sad note, he was standing firm on the idea that we should focus on happiness. By happiness he didn't mean running after every pleasure but rather fulfilling purpose. I guess we should take a lesson from that and apply it to what we do. </p></main></div></div><div id="article-bottom"><hr><div><p><h2>Looking for new ways to stay connected with your team?</h2></p><p>Bill is a Slack app that helps your team get to know each other better using fun icebreaker games.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="Post__Main-Content">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Hey Kaio! Thanks for taking the time to talk with me about your journey! To start, why don’t you tell me about yourself!</strong></p><p>I’m originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goi%C3%A2nia+-+State+of+Goi%C3%A1s,+Brazil/@-11.7982607,-55.4825581,4.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x935ef0ede1248cf7:0xbaedffbfd0c11fd1!8m2!3d-16.6868982!4d-49.2648114">Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil</a> but currently live in a small city called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palmas,+State+of+Tocantins,+Brazil/@-11.6859599,-50.3391487,6.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x933b3439911f1257:0x93b8070d05c818f!8m2!3d-10.249091!4d-48.3242858">Palmas</a>. Well it’s small by Brazil standards, it’s no São Paulo (12 million people) - there are about 400,000 people here. When I first arrived I only had my bike with me, I really like biking so I thought it would be all I’d need, but everything is pretty spread out so I now have a motorcycle as well.</p><p>For fun, I’m always reading plus... <em>something else</em>; for a while this was dancing. I learned 4-5 kinds of ballroom dancing, tango, zouki, forró and, of course, Brazil’s popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CimlZ1Vaqzc">samba!</a> At some point I realized that I wanted to fight more than I wanted to dance so I started training in jiu jitsu!</p><p><strong>Hah! A bit of a change!</strong></p><p>Yes, I’ve been doing it for 3 years. After practicing on a daily basis, I can tell you the best defense is to run! Always try to run first in a bad situation, you never know the other person’s intentions, if they have a weapon, or what their training is.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Great advice! So that’s your “something else” right now, but what do you like to read?</strong></p><p>I read a lot of different things. I’ve always read fantasy, but lately it’s been more “reality-related” stuff - a lot about leadership (like, <em>a lot</em>) or books that have communication as the main topic. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057">“Extreme Ownership”</a> by Jocko Willink and Leif Brabin is one of my favorites. Jocko has a podcast that I listen to as well and he talks about a book in almost every episode.</p><p>I’ve also been reading a lot of war-related books. They’re very interesting even though they get in the way of my sleep. It’s quite hard to sleep after you read about the ugly stuff of war! Though it doesn’t affect my dreams. The only fighting that happens in my dreams is jiu jitsu - I <em>always</em> wake up right after I get a hold locked on my opponent. Always!</p><p><strong>So you’re the CTO. How do you describe what you do here at Codelitt?</strong></p><p>The shortest description is: my job is to make sure that everyone on the engineering team has what they need to succeed in their tasks. Since I'm no longer a full-time engineer (although I work with engineering as much as I can) my goal is to make sure my team has all the resources they need. </p><p>So yes, I’m the CTO, but in the tech world my role goes by a lot of different names. It’s kind of a hybrid of management and engineering. At the end of the day a person in my position is leading, but I also have to be in the trenches to ensure that the quality of the output is something that I myself would be proud of.</p><p><strong>How did you end up in software engineering?</strong></p><p>I’ve always loved technology. I got my first computer when I was 11 years old. I like to say that I “never really left the chair” even though I grew up with my mom telling me that I’d lose the use of my hands if I worked on the computer all day. </p><p>For university, I was initially focusing on Biological Sciences but 2 years in when I was 19 years old I made the switch to software engineering. I used to think these two were <em>totally</em> different, but I realized that a lot of areas, ecology and DNA work for example, are very mathematical in their approach. Also I saw that there were some lessons in biology, like the importance of naming and classification, that are also key in software engineering. We try and fail miserably in engineering, but we’re getting there! </p><p><strong>What made you switch?</strong></p><p>I became frustrated that I had to go through an entire course to properly work in the biology market. I could do some internships, but they were pretty limited. I also looked into the future and didn’t like the idea of doing research for the university. I believed that the idea was to write <em>papers </em>instead of getting <em>results.</em> There seemed to be too much focus on getting points academically than producing quality output, you know, to be promoted at the university it is about research points, not research results.</p><p>Software engineering also gave me the freedom to work <em>where</em> I wanted to. I didn’t have to be in a lab to work. I could use my <em>reasoning </em>to solve problems and get results - I didn’t need something physical, a specimen, to solve a problem. When we studied substances and their effects on rats, we had to go to the lab. I realized I’d rather get the problem that I was supposed to solve and then go off somewhere to think about it.</p><p>I’m also a big fan of small victories. You know, the really small things that add up at the end of the day. You can have this in biology, but every advancement is pretty huge since we know so much at this point. With software engineering, you can literally create anything out of thin air. Goals are only limited by <em>time</em> and not by any <em>physical</em> resource. </p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio-1.jpg"></figure><p><strong>I like that! So how did you find Codelitt? </strong></p><p>So before I started with Codelitt I was working for a tech company in Goiânia. At this point, I had already been studying software engineering for a while. I made up my mind to find the top engineer within my company so I could find out what makes them the best at what they do. This person was Bruno! He would later go on to become the CTO.</p><p>A year or so after I met him, Bruno and I had teamed up to lead an effort to create a new product for the company and started discussing the idea of working remotely. One thing I noticed was that there were a lot of positions looking for Ruby engineers, so I teamed up with him to learn it - although he knew quite a lot of it already. We both decided to start looking for remote jobs with US based companies. It was actually Bruno that found Codelitt first!</p><p>So before Bruno started working as Codelitt’s CTO, I reached out to him to see if there were any open source projects that I could work on after I’d finished with my day job. For me it was all about practice and the chance to get some more experience. Luckily Bruno said, yes there was a project!</p><p>This project was actually the side project for Cody, Codelitt’s Founder, so I had the opportunity to meet him briefly. A few weeks later, Bruno sent me a screenshot of a Slack conversation where Cody was asking Bruno if he “knew this guy Kaio” because they needed a Ruby developer. I was so happy.</p><p>I was initially offered a contract job for 3 weeks. Cody made sure this assignment was super clear for me saying something like, “Hey this is the deal - we only have work for 3 weeks. I just want to make sure you understand that if you leave your job for this, then in 3 weeks you won’t have a job anymore.” </p><p>This was the first opportunity to work remotely <em>and</em> for the US. It was huge for me! I was <em>terrible </em>at English, though. Like seriously, at one point during the interview Cody said, “Hey Bruno you can continue the interview in portuguese and just let me know what you think.” Honestly though, as soon as I received the screenshot from Bruno I knew I was going to say yes!</p><p>With Bruno being the CTO of Codelitt, I had a lot of responsibilities that I wouldn’t normally have had as a junior developer. He was working side by side with the CEO. Career-wise, it was great for me. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">Jeff Bezos calls it “regret minimizing”</a>. The idea comes from the question “What will you regret - doing something or <em>not</em> doing something?” If I hadn’t taken the opportunity I know, then I would have regretted it.</p><p><strong>What are some of the big differences between then and now?</strong></p><p>First thing that comes to mind is the size. I first joined as a contractor and at that time this meant I only had contact with the people that I <em>needed </em>to have contact with: the CTO and COO. We were a total of 7 people then and today we’re 35-40 people typically. Back then the engineering team was only 3 people and more often than not we were working on the same project together.</p><p>The amount of projects that we manage at the same time is different too. In the early days it was no more than 2-3. It took a while to run 4 projects. Now we’re much more efficient.</p><p>The third biggest difference is communication. In the beginning, communication was easy with so few people and projects. It was almost too easy! Back then, I had direct access to the CTO. You know, I didn’t have to run a question to HR. Anything project-related I ran to the CEO! &nbsp;Now it’s very different.</p><p><strong>What are some of your favorite memories or favorite projects that you’ve worked on? </strong></p><p>I think about this a lot - I have a lot of good memories. With projects, we always have something new which is always fun. In the beginning, it would often be only myself and another developer on a project, most of the projects in my first two years were like this.</p><p>I’d say my favorite project was my first project. </p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard in my life. I mean, I’ve probably worked harder on other projects in recent years but I’m stronger than I was then. It’s like a guy going to the gym the first time and trying to lift. It was the first project that I owned fully - pages, process, etc. - I was the one developer tasked with building <em>everything </em>the user will see. Working together with the CTO was huge because he was able to provide me with a ton of technical help. I wasn’t as good as someone should be for this project, so I had to work <em>extra </em>hard for it.</p><p>On a common day, I worked 14 hours. Between Aug 1st and Oct 11th I worked 7 days a week, 14 hours a day. I may have taken two Sundays off, but I still worked 6 hours. That was a “day off” for me. </p><p>I mention that not because I think it was good. It was NOT healthy. Nowadays I would <em>never </em>accept working like that again. It was a “high cost” experience because it’s not just about the time spent working, it’s also about mental health. At one point I remember getting to my desk and seeing 5 empty cans of Red Bull. Sometimes I’d go to bed at 12am and wake up at 4am. </p><p>It was a great experience because it showed me how far I could go.</p><p>Although I’d love to say that I was up for continuing on like this if needed, I wasn’t.

I’m your host, dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Thomasz Łakomy.</p><p>But before I start, let me share something fantastic news. The podcast has gotten its first sponsor. I’m so happy about this because it means I can focus even more on producing episodes for you. And it’s not any sponsor. It’s an amazing match. Actually, two founders, Tracy and Dom reached out to me. They are building CodeSubmit, a take home assignment platform to streamline your tech recruiting. They’re already profitable and they are part of the TinySeed Accelerator. The reason for them to build CodeSubmit is because they strongly believe that take home challenges are the most candidate friendly way of assessing developer talent. And they could not find a dedicated tool for them. So they set out to build the best experience for take home assignments for hiring managers and developers. It’s built on Git and they support 64 different languages and frameworks, even though it’s a young startup, and it’s built the Indy Way, they already worked with hundreds of companies. Well, last weekend to show me the whole experience and it’s fantastic. So I really hope you go and check out CodeSubmit. You can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://codesubmit.io/" rel="nofollow">https://codesubmit.io</a>. And they also offer a free trial. Well, if you like it, please give them some love and social media for sponsoring this episode.</p><p>But now, back to Thomasz. Thomasz is a senior front end engineer at the Alix group, which is a fast-growing platform for trading businesses. Commercial is also an ad hack instructor. He’s certified for AWS and he’s a speaker and blogger. So I’m really happy to have Thomasz here with me, Thomasz, welcome to the show.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:46] Hello, everyone. I’m very happy to be here.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:48] So, Thomas, maybe as a start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at Alix group on the website? It says it’s a platform for buying and selling cars, finding housing, getting jobs, buying, and selling household goods. But what are your team’s responsibilities? What are your tasks at this company?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:02:05] Sure. So, as you’ve mentioned, like basically what we do at Olin’s group is, but we did a huge number of different websites for like buying stuff, selling stuff. So as you mentioned, we have cars, we have real estate, we have goods, we have services. So there’s obviously a lot of things going on. And obviously, you know, my team in particular, like we cannot be responsible for everything. The way we work at all X group is about each team is focused on a certain area of the business and they own it competently. So my team is focused on all the jobs because not only you can bounce stuff, but you can also find a better hopefully job at all X. So what we are building is what we are building solutions. That has people find a, you know, a newer better job in particular, we are working on something that is called a candidate profile, because the idea that we have in mind is about, you know, CVS are kind of outdated because this concept of a CV has been around for, for ages and when we need something better. So not only people can create basically are four fires at all X, but we also are going to use the data in the profile. In order to find people. I bet a job automatically because we send them recommendations based on their profile and also the face on the job ads that were actually, they were going through on the other side. So we are kind of, kind of trying to find a better job for them.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:34] Okay. So can I imagine it as like LinkedIn, but a little bit different or is it very different?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:41] Is this somewhat different than LinkedIn? I think LinkedIn has this very, very focused on like white collar jobs. So, you know, white collar, basically what I mean by that is that, you know, you work in the office, you probably have a product to probably have a, you know, a title that is in English and you probably spend your time in front of a computer. And this is not the reality of like, I suppose like majority of people, because people have different careers, people have different skill sets and whatnot. So what we are trying to build is to have a product that is somewhat similar to LinkedIn as a new, create a profile. And you can use it to find a better job, but with a much broader focus. So we are wanting to target basically everyone who is looking for a job in Poland. And also help them find a better job because like not everybody is used to, you know, searching for a job, offer online, not everybody’s student negotiating. So one of the experiments that we’ve had a couple of times, I go, there’s also building a platform in which the employer would have to provide a salary because we also would like to in ideal a scenario, avoid this process of, you know, Whenever you have to negotiate a salary, how much do you want? How much are you willing to give me? How much do you want? And so bucket and so forth.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:05:02] Yeah, for me, it’s always mind blowing that, you know, I, to be honest, I haven’t known about all ex before. Right. And so for this podcast, I researched it a little bit and I went on the website and I see like this large numbers of employees that you have. And then I went to the career side and I see, wow. There, I think if I, on the top of my head, I think there were like 16 open positions in data analysis or data engineering, something like this. Right. Then there were like 80 positions for engineers. Right. And I was like, Wow, because I worked as a data scientist or like a researcher before. Right. And sometimes struggling, like where are the companies that actually hiring, you know, people with these skillsets and then you’re stumbling across a company that you never heard of anything like, well, this is not a small company. It’s a large corporation, right. That you’re actually working for. And so, yeah, maybe what would be interesting for me is like, well, you said my team, right? So my team, and then you’re working with data scientists. What are other engineers that you’re working with? Right. You’re a front-end engineer. So who is on your team? You know, do you have like testers on your team? Do you have like designers on your team and, and then you’re working with data scientists. How does the communication work like this? Can you tell me a little bit about the structure and you know, how, how are teams collaborating at all X.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:06:13] Sure. So the way we kind of work at all X or X group is, but each team is a park. So we are defined the divided into something that is called a park and a park is this like self-contained unit of the organization that can ship their staff to the production. So each park has, you know, If you need front-end engineers, you have a front end engineer, you have buckets, engineers you’ll have product managers. There’s usually an engineering manager. If there are no engineers on the team, that’s kind of all, it is also useful. Some teams have a dedicated designer, some teams are working closely with, you know, with the designers, but they’re not necessarily in that team because some teams have like different needs when it comes to things like design. We also have a business analyst in our team. So again, like this is a very kind of self contained unit. What I like about this setup is because I used to work in the companies where we have, we had a front-end department and we had a backend and not only was communication tricky, but also working in an actual AI way was some somewhat difficult because as a front end engineer, if I wanted to get, by the way, I would like to get this one more piece of data from the backend. Then you had to go do the backend team, talk to them, but they apparently have the authority for this, for this space. I have to wait for the next bit and whatnot. Whereas in our current setup, we’ve worked very closely together. So we are not working in a silo, but quite the contrary, we are working very closely together with backend engineers, front end engineers. All of those skill sets that are required to build amazing products. Everything is included in that team. And I are very proud as a front end engineer of our backend engineers, because there are actually submitting a feedback when it comes to design and when it comes to UX solution that we build it. So this is honestly, this is something that I haven’t seen before then. Just the level of commitment to building. Uh, great products and not only, you know, juggling Jason data, as some of buckets engineers are used to doing.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:23] Okay. Yeah. And so how many front end engineers are, for example, in your team, but</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:29] those themes, they don’t have to be very large. So in my thing currently, we have two trumpet engineers. There’s two backend engineers. We have a dedicated contact in the data science team. So he’s not technically in our team, but we are working very closely together. We also have a dedicated designer, a product manager, business analyst, and my engineer manager. So there’s less than 10 people in total. I like this role that each team should be large enough that a one pizza can fit the entire theme. And I think this is not a good metric for how large the teams should be. Yeah, I like that.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:07] But with 10 people and one pizza, I mean, everybody gets a little slice. Really?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:14] Yeah.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:15] Yeah. And so one of the things that I love is code reviews. And so if you have like two front end engineers, do you do code reviews for each other? Or do you have like the back end engineers also looking at your code? …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week my mom died after a three year battle with cancer. I was fortunate to be by her bedside in the last few days of her life. At the beginning she was lucid and we got to say good bye— a great privilege. Then, for days, I watched her struggle for every breath as her breathing got shallower and shallower, until it eventually stopped.</p><p>Watching your parent die momentarily changes your executive depth of field. Important aspects of life near the foreground and assume unprecedented sharpness; unimportant ones recede and blur with the background. What matters and what doesn't becomes exceptionally obvious. For a moment, there is no mistaking one for the other.</p><p>In her last days, my mom had the long view on her life. Our conversations were emotional, but in part they sounded like a strategic postmortem, the way one might analyze key moments of a football game. Much of what she recalled was surprising— details that must have been mundane at the time, but turned out to have crucial importance to her in the end.</p><p>I wanted to write the lessons that seemed obvious to me while I was with her before they fade from memory. This is my writing and my view.  If my mom wrote this, the list would have been different. In all likelihood, she would have disagreed with many of my conclusions. Most of them contradict each other anyway. Caveat emptor.</p><ul><li><p>At the end, you will care about 3-5 things.</p></li><li><p>Your relationship with your parents, your spouse, and your children will be on that list. Get as many of these right as you can.</p></li><li><p>You can't know everything you will care about, but you can introspect the most important things. Do that early.</p></li><li><p>Always keep them in mind. Write them down. Review them daily. This is your North Star.</p></li><li><p>Declare bankruptcy on bullshit— faux emergencies, manufactured glitter, family and relationship drama, pointless errands, gossip, events you can't control, judgement of strangers, the opinion of Jeremiahs. My god, what an exhausting waste of time! Let it all go.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something that you regret later, write it down. Then do those things less.</p></li><li><p>There will be times when you will have to be ruthless. When those times come, do not flinch. Do what must be done.</p></li><li><p>Addiction, abuse, depression and violence erode your humanity. Extricate yourself from these situations without mercy. Be strong. Do not permit anyone to harm you.</p></li><li><p>Don't neglect your body and don't obsess over it. Eat good food, exercise, attend to medical needs when it becomes necessary.</p></li><li><p>Get off the internet.</p></li><li><p>Cultivate a reading habit, and read widely. Reading broadens the imagination and expands the space of possibilities. It's a way out of the prison of your circumstance available to almost anyone who wants it.</p></li><li><p>Do more. Don't wake up one day thinking you haven't done all you could.</p></li><li><p>Have faith that the powers of darkness will, in time, <a href="https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/bad367b8edfc189a337bbf691b8fcb32">be crushed by the spirit of light</a>.</p></li><li><p>Seek  advice, but don't outsource your decisions. No one can make them for you.</p></li><li><p>Make a list of people you want to impress. Keep it very short. Be sure these people have your best interests at heart. Then ignore judgement from anyone not on the list.</p></li><li><p>Learn to think for yourself. The best way is to be around someone who can already do that. The second best way is to read correspondence of inventors, scientists, mathematicians, and artists. Third best is to read biographies. Ideally, do all three.</p></li><li><p>Examine your circumstance every few months. If something makes you unhappy for too long, make a change. Don't live a life of quiet desperation.</p></li><li><p>Strive for excellence, not greatness. <em>(thanks Robert!)</em></p></li><li><p>The hardest battles are the ones you’ll fight with yourself.</p></li><li><p>Accept people as facts.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something you don't want to do, but are happy about it later, write it down. Do those things more.</p></li><li><p>Have adventures that carry risk. Start a business, ask out the girl you like, climb a mountain. This is where you'll find the 3-5 things that matter.</p></li><li><p>Have children.</p></li><li><p>Cultivate a sense of humor in all things. Prefer comedy over tragedy.</p></li></ul><p>My mom’s last words to me before she fell asleep and never woke up:</p><blockquote><p>Wear warm clothes. There is apple strudel for you on the kitchen table. Be strong.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll miss you every day, mom ❤️</p></div></div>]]>

  <h2>Pixel-Perfect Scrolling With a Mouse Wheel Under Linux</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-01-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Jan 2020</time>
  <p>Yesterday, I plugged in my Logitech mouse into my laptop and started reading a PDF file. I started scrolling the page and realized that the scrolling is not as smooth as with my touchpad. The difference is that the touchpad scrolls the PDF pixel-by-pixel, whereas my mouse scrolls the PDF with one scroll-wheel click roughly 3 lines at once.</p>

<p>I previously had a look into the HID++ protocol of Logitech mice to <a href="https://github.com/fin-ger/logitech-m720-config">enable the thumb button of my M720</a>, and did know that my mouse has a high-resolution mode for the scroll-wheel. So, technically it is possible to get high-resolution scrolling data from my mouse and translate it to smooth pixel-perfect scrolling in my PDF viewer.</p>

<p>I searched the internet, read systemd source code, dug into libinput documentation, and finally found a way to achieve pixel-perfect scrolling! 🎉</p>

<h2 id="here-is-how-to-set-it-up">Here is how to set it up!</h2>

<p>First you have to install the <code>solaar</code> package with your Linux distribution’s package manager.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/solaar">Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/eoan/solaar">Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/solaar">Fedora</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-misc/solaar">Gentoo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/solaar/">Arch</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madb.mageia.org/package/show/release/cauldron/application/0/name/solaar">Mageia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/Solaar">OpenSUSE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After installing, follow the wizard to configure your unifying receiver and mouse. Now, you can use <code>Solaar</code> to configure some options on your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property enables the high-resolution mode on the mouse-wheel.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/solaar-config.png" alt="Solaar configuration window"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the wheel resolution property is not working with all unifying receivers. If it is not working, you can try restarting and disconnecting and reconnecting the unifying receiver to see if it works then, but some receivers of mine were no able to set the property. The receiver with <code>Bootloader 34.00.B0004</code> and <code>Firmware 04.02.B0009</code> worked best for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can try to set the property via the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>solaar config <span>"M720 Triathlon"</span> hires-smooth-resolution <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property could be successfully set, you will recognize way too fast scrolling behavior. This can be changed by applying some <code>udev</code> <code>uwdb</code> rules.</p>

<p>Create the file <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-logitech-m720.hwdb</code> as <strong>root</strong> and open it in your preferred editor (also as root or with sudo). Insert the following lines and save the file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mouse:usb:v046dp405e:name:Logitech M720 Triathlon:
mouse:bluetooth:v046dpb015:name:M720 Triathlon:
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_ANGLE</span><span>=</span>1
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_COUNT</span><span>=</span>360
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Documentation on all available options for your mouse can be found <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/05de16766b6bae290c500857269b753df2a0c649/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a>. A more up-to-date version may be available <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a> (might be broken in the future).</p>

<p>Next, we have to apply the changes. Run the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm hwdb <span>--update</span>
<span>$ </span>libinput list-devices | <span>grep</span> <span>-A</span> 1 M720
Device:           Logitech M720 Triathlon
Kernel:           /dev/input/event15
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm trigger /dev/input/event15
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replace <code>/dev/input/event15</code> with the result shown by `libinput list-devices**</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

<p>You got pixel-perfect scrolling with your mouse-wheel!</p>

<video width="1000" controls="">
  <source src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/m720.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>A before/after comparison of the proposed configuration</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="persisting-the-configuration">Persisting the Configuration</h2>

<p>The <code>hwdb</code> configuration will be automatically loaded when you plug in your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property is sometimes restored by Solaar, and sometimes not. Try to put Solaar in the autostart of your desktop environment. It might work. Otherwise, you have to manually enable the property 😢</p>

<h2 id="enhancements-and-future-work">Enhancements and Future Work</h2>

<p>The scrolling can stutter or jump when scrolling really slow. Also, when the middle mouse button is clicked you may unintentionally scroll, as the sensitivity of the scroll-wheel is so high. Maybe, this can be solved by applying a filter with libinput on the incoming scroll events. I have not figured out, how to set this up, yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>DevOps, the method of <strong>automating processes between development and operations</strong>, is one of the essential factors of successfully implementing a cloud-native approach. Since cloud-native has a purpose to<strong> reduce go-to-market time and bring more efficiency to companies</strong>, DevOps is what streamlines individuals, tools, and systems, contributing to the overall success of the enterprise. This is what makes cloud-native DevOps a logical step towards improved productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both cloud-native and DevOps movements are on the rise. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/devops-market#:~:text=The%20global%20DevOps%20Market%20is,USD%2017.27%20Billion%20in%202027." target="_blank">Reports and Data</a> predict that <em>the global DevOps market will grow from $4.49 billion in 2019 to $17.27 billion in 2027</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is more, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/devops-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank">the COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced cloud adoption</a>. <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/idc-worldwide-it-predictions-for-2021-that-cios-need-to-know/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20a%20dramatic,affect%20the%20enterprise%20by%202023.">Predictions</a> say that by the end of 2021, <strong>80% of companies will double the adoption of cloud-centric infrastructure and apps</strong>. This is mainly due to the shift to a remote-first workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A cloud-native DevOps approach maximizes agility with continuous deployment. Moreover, it scales up systems and applications without the need for drastic changes.</p>



<p><em>Let’s dive in and see what this approach really means.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>What is the cloud-native approach to software development?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Adopting the cloud-native approach means embracing many new options for leveraging innovations. <em>The primary tools cloud-native teams use are offered by the cloud instead of on-premise infrastructure.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Cloud-native applications are <strong>agile, adaptable, robust, and easy to monitor.</strong> This means that teams build them with frequent and quick deployments and iterations. Instead of preventing failure, they embrace it and have <strong>the ability to improve in real-time</strong>. </p>



<p>Furthermore, they don’t rely on external factors when it comes to monitoring. Instead, the application can be controlled from the inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cloud-native beginnings date from around ten years ago, when a group of tech leaders introduced it to the public. <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/2010/05/cloud-native.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This blog post</a> by Paul Fremantle,  VP of Technical Product Strategy at Weaveworks, is among the first related articles. In the post, he claims that applications should be written FOR the cloud to behave well ON the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 2015, Matt Stine, Executive Director at JPMorgan Chase, cleared the cloud-native concept in his book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/migrating-to-cloud-native/9781492047605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now,<strong> the cloud-native umbrella covers many tools and methods, including microservices, containers, CI/CD, multi-cloud</strong>, etc. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape</a> provides a great overview of most of the tools used in the cloud-native approach.&nbsp; To help and provide development communities with good alternatives for building cloud-native applications, the CNCF cultivates this landscape of open source tools.</p>



<h2>What is cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If we combine the two definitions, cloud-native DevOps turns into <strong>a set of practices that consists of constant development, automated actions, and cross-functional teams,</strong> which result in improving the entire experience of the end-user. Cloud-native DevOps is all about <strong>making your company more flexible.</strong> You achieve this through technologies like Kubernetes and containers, which can automate processes and make applications more scalable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these practices apply to almost every aspect of the company. This means changing the entire culture which involves tools, people, and processes. When it comes to <strong>culture, </strong>you need to <a href="https://microtica.com/want-to-move-from-ops-to-devops-here-is-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopt a DevOps-oriented approach</a>. This will foster better alignment between people and tools. </p>



<p>You have to motivate your employees to collaborate more effectively, encouraging a faster feedback circle. Faster feedback will enable quick iterations and real-time improvements. </p>



<p>You’ll also have to make some <strong>technical changes</strong>. This refers to adopting technologies that are in the center of cloud-native DevOps, such as containerization and microservices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How to get started with cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>These are the options to get started with a cloud-native strategy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Implementing a cloud-first strategy by choosing a cloud provider instead of an on-premises one</li><li>Adopting a multi-cloud strategy if it meets business needs more closely</li><li>Embracing DevOps, which is obviously what we’re going to focus on further in this post.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>When companies realize that agile development requires both automation and culture transformation to produce quality applications faster, DevOps becomes a priority. Handling multiple hybrid environments or streamlining infrastructure stuff can get very complicated. That’s why the popularity of tools that align cloud-native and DevOps processes is rising rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make the implementation of cloud-native DevOps easier, these are some things you should pay attention to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Containerization</strong> enables the creation of environment-agnostic software. It also eliminates implementation conflicts between developers and operation departments, enabling developers and testers to communicate easier.</li><li><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/why-transition-from-monolith-to-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Going from monolith to microservices</a> </strong>also makes the company more agile. This establishes a set of tools, terms, and processes for both development and operation teams. With microservices, you get sophisticated process automation and an easier transition towards agile product development, which is what continuous delivery requires.</li><li><strong>Using a container orchestration platform</strong>. The most popular is Kubernetes because it solves the challenges related to underlying computing, storage, and networking.</li><li><strong>Automating CI/CD pipelines </strong>in order to reduce complexity and the chances of errors. This automation can save a lot of headaches for developers. Moreover, it allows them to focus on the actual product instead of fixing issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Writing code <strong><a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the 12 factors</a></strong> also makes things more transparent.</li></ul>



<h2>Most common mistakes in adopting cloud-native DevOps</h2>



<h3><strong>Using too many tools</strong></h3>



<p>Once you switch to cloud-native DevOps, you’ll try automating as many processes as possible. However, you don’t do this by just adding and adding tools. You have to pick the right tools and make the best combination that’s right for your application. Overusing tools will also cost you a lot of time and money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another mistake here is that developers often get too reliable of a certain tool. The essence of DevOps, however, lies in the team spirit and the implementation of correct practices that contribute to increased productivity and enhanced processes.</p>



<h3><strong>Avoiding continuous monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>While testing inside the implementation pipelines makes the things more straightforward and flowing, it also makes them limited&nbsp; and incomplete. Continuous monitoring, on the other hand, can optimize the entire process by highlighting each malfunction that happens even after the testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Not paying enough attention to security</strong></h3>



<p>Security checks can be quite time-consuming and costly. Teams often think of that security checking capabilities as something that is put to use within the CI/CD workflows. The implementation of a separate tool that takes care of security is a critical move for DevOps to turn and avoid any vulnerabilities in the process.</p>



<h3><strong>Making the transition too fast</strong></h3>



<p>Adopting cloud-native DevOps should be a slow process with a lot of learning on the way. Expecting a company that has been using on-premise applications to immediately align all their structures and platforms into a single cloud-native architecture is simply impossible. Maybe you can quickly make new cloud-native applications, but transitioning existing applications will take a while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best solutions would be to go step-by-step. Start by migrating applications to the cloud and continue with transitioning from monolith to microservices. Then, you can set up containers and container orchestration platforms. However, none of this will be successful unless you undergo the culture shift we talk about so much.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>To wrap things up</h2>



<p>Effective implementation of cloud-native DevOps helps businesses to market fresh technologies more rapidly, speeding up their digital transformation. Through cutting enormous cloud costs and rising efficiency and performance, the cloud-native approach has become a blessing to companies with software products. Completely relying on the potential of cloud-native DevOps, unlocks on-demand, unlimited software development powers.</p>

<h3>[ 2020-December-05 19:55 ]</h3>
<p>When accepting a job or working at a startup, you need to understand what startup options might be worth. In this article, I'll describe the simple models I use. I learned about options during the 7 years of my career running a startup (failed), then working for one (still doing well!). Stock options are a complicated subject, and I will not explain anything other than how I personally estimate their value. My advice is probably wrong. Like any financial decision, you should research your choices carefully. If you want to understand startup stock options in depth, I recommend the book <a href="https://www.venturedeals.com/">Venture Deals: Be smarter than your lawyer and your venture capitalist</a>.</p>

<h2>Trivial model: Your options are worthless</h2>

<p>Assume your stock options are worth $0. If this is true, will you still take the job, or stay with your employer? If the answer is no, I recommend looking for other jobs. There are many, many ways that startup stock will become worthless. The company can go bankrupt. It can have financial trouble, and dilute existing investors in order to raise money (research: "down round"). It can be purchased for a small enough amount of money that investors get all of it (research: "liquidation preference"). It can continue to exist for a long time, either as an independent company, or be acquired by another private company for stock. The average outcome for a startup is that it is worth $0, since most startups fail. You should estimate how likely you think this is, based on what you know about the company. However, you should be pessimistic, since even high-flying companies can run into challenges (e.g. WeWork, Theranos, and many, many others). I like to assume that even good startups have at least a 50% chance of being effectively worth $0.</p>

<p>This does not mean you should never consider working for a startup. However, you should have good reasons other than the potential financial reward. The reliable way to earn a lot of money in the software industry, at least for the last 20-30 years, is to work at a big publicly traded software company. However, small companies have other advantages. Working at a small company gives you more responsibility and an environment with a higher rate of change. In the best startups, this means you can learn different skills, and might learn at a faster rate than at a large company. More specifically, I think that startups provide much better insight into how businesses work. You will get more exposure to important concepts like revenue, cost of good sold, and the cost to acquire customers. At large companies, other job functions are very remote, so you are isolated from having to know anything about them.</p>

<p>As a personal disclosure, at the time of writing, I am working at Datadog, which I consider a big company. However, working at startups taught me an enormous amount about the business of software. I do not regret my choices, even though I likely would have made more have working at Google, Twitter, or any other publicly traded company. (Although that could still change! Come on <a href="https://www.bluecore.com/">Bluecore</a>, I'm rooting for you!) I would also consider working for another startup, or even starting my own again at some point in the future.</p>

<h2>Financial model: Value the company</h2>

<p>The next approach is to estimate how valuable the company is. You can then compute your stock value = (company value)×(ownership fraction). This is very hard, and professional investors make or break their careers on their ability to do this. However, even a simple model is useful, as long as you recognize that it is probably wrong. I like to assume that I have a 50% chance of the stock being worth $0, a 40% chance of getting the money I use to exercise the options back, and a 10% chance of the stock being worth something. This means that my risk-adjusted "expected value" of the stock is approximately 1/10th the estimated value. Another way of saying this is you should believe that your options have some chance at being worth 10× what you will pay to exercise them. If this sounds crazy, you should walk. Again, you should adjust the chance of the stock being worth something based on your opinion of the company, since every company is different. But again, be pessimistic! It is easy to be sentimental for companies that you have worked for, or where you know employees personally.</p>

<p>To compute the ownership fraction, you should ask the company for the total number of outstanding shares, including the options pool. Private companies are sometimes hesitant to provide this information. If they don't want to divulge, I like to tell them that means I have to assume the stock is worthless when comparing their offer to other companies. This should motivate them to share some information, or you should take a job elsewhere. It is a bad sign if your employer lacks transparency for a basic thing like company value.</p>

<p> The numbers I like to use to estimate the company value are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Last 409a valuation</strong>: The 409a valuation is an IRS requirement, and is the "fair market value" of common stock, based on <a href="https://carta.com/blog/what-is-a-409a-valuation/#jumpto6">a number of evaluation methodologies</a>. I think of this as a "low" estimate. It is supposed to be approximately what an investor would pay for a share of common stock, at the time of the estimate. The company is either worth more than this in the future, or it is worth $0. This mean you should consider a range of values, based on your opinion of how fast the company is growing (e.g. maybe 1×, 2×, 5×, 10×?). If you are a current employee, this number should be available to you, since you need it for tax purposes if you exercise your options.</li>

<li><strong>Last round valuation</strong>: At the last round of investment, professional investors believed they could earn a profit by buying shares at this price. In one way, this is a low estimate because it was made some time in the past. You can only sell the shares in the future, if the company has grown and is more valuable. However, this is also a high estimate because as an employee you have common shares, while investors have preferred shares. Preferred shares are less risky because they typically have a liquidation preference, so therefore are worth more.</li>

<li><strong>Multiple of annual recurring revenue (ARR)</strong>: A rough way to value companies, particularly SaaS companies, is to assume they are worth some multiple of their revenue. <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/valuation_multiples_2020-03-02/">An evaluation of public company SaaS revenue multiples in March 2020</a> showed that the average public SaaS company has a valuation that is about 6-8× their ARR. However, the faster the growth, the higher the valuation, so it ranges from 30× to 1×. You should calculate a range of values, based on how fast you think the company is growing.</li>

<li><strong>Comparable acquisitions/fundraising (high)</strong>: If you know of similar or competing businesses that have recently raised money or have been acquired, you can use their valuations. You will need to scale them to match the size of the company and to adjust for differences in their businesses. This is complicated because no two businesses are the same, and you need to know about comparable events. I usually don't bother with this, unless you know of something relevant.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Regret minimization</h2>

<p>After I have some rough idea of what the company might be worth, I like to imagine how I will feel in the future in two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stock is worth $0, and I exercised my options or accepted the job: How bad will I feel about losing this money, or about the other job opportunities I passed up?</li>
<li>The stock is worth something, and I did not exercise my options or passed on the job: How bad will I feel hearing about how much money I could have made?</li>
</ul>

<p>I find it useful to think about what choices I will regret the least. Avoiding regret is why I usually advise people leaving a startup to exercise some of their options (e.g. $100-1000), even if they think the company is not doing well. If I walked away from options after working at a company for some time, then later learned those options would have been worth something, I would be very annoyed at myself. If you own at least a token amount, you can share in any potential future success, while limiting the amount you might lose.</p>

Starting from an initial guess and iterating to an optimal point is key to getting  the right kind customers and many of them.</p><p>That’s no different as a marketplace, but the vectors are different. Especially if you are taking <a href="https://twosided.io/p/monetization-strategies-for-marketplaces">transaction commissions</a>, many changes can only applied to new users (i.e. taking a bigger cut) at a time or need to be agreed to.</p><p>This can be painful and difficult. Marketplaces are more static for that reason. Some commission schemes at leading marketplaces have stayed unchanged for years.</p><p>Let me show you an example that it’s still worth to experiment with your pricing, though. At <a href="https://mentorcruise.com/">MentorCruise</a>, pricing is moving and changing all the time, but in 2020  there were two really big changes, can you spot them?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:1306,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72638,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I’ve made it easy for you, but let me walk you through it :)</p><p>In <strong>March 2020</strong>, I decided to push for a monthly subscription model. Previously, mentees were able to pay weekly and one-off rates and churned quickly at the sight of those many transactions. Going with longer windows yielded longer mentorships.</p><p>That growth compounded to something along a 600% growth in just six month, but it was harder to pull off than just setting up a new pricing plan.</p><p>While great for creating longer lasting mentorships, mentors were now getting access to their funds a lot slower.</p><p>Previously, if they had set up weekly calls, they got funds sent to their accounts not more than 7 days after. Now, they would take up to a month to clear!</p><p>Documentation and customer support were crucial here to explain these new delayed payouts.</p><p>Then, in <strong>September 2020</strong>, I felt locked in by my fee structure. From any transaction I would take a 20% cut. Pricing was in the hand of mentors. That didn’t allow me to expand and experiment on that front a lot.</p><p>While transparent, it’s also a fee structure that hurts to see. Frequently I would get messages why after all fees a mentor would only receive $78 out of their $100 price tag.</p><p>So, I ran a wide migration that would give mentors 100% of what they wanted to charge and put my own fees on top. On one side, that made the prices go a little higher, but would give me a change to experiment with that cut, run promotions, try and round to $xx9 instead of $xx0, all without adjusting the partner agreement.</p><p><strong>So, let’s stop with the anecdotes. Pricing changes in the right direction are worth it, but how are they done right?</strong></p><p>1) If you are building something new, my advice would be to choose a structure that does not limit your freedom. Agree on a flat fee with your suppliers, then experiment with whatever fee or pricing you put on top.</p><p>If you work on something where pricing changes require you to change partner agreements, work on one last migration that will get you away from that.</p><p>2) If you do need to change partner agreements, provide an option to be grandfathered or opt out. For example, a few months into operations, we started to provide a 7-day trial at MentorCruise. Three mentors opted out, but were later convinced by the far more superior numbers.</p><p>3) Look into non-commission based pricing schemes. For example, sites like MicroAcquire charge a subscription for access and a lot of the revenue of ebay comes from advertising.</p><p>4) Communicate! Pricing changes that are visible to suppliers will always produce customer support load, be braced for it.</p><p>Going for a marketplace structure should not limit the decisions you can take around pricing.</p><p>Instead, they should be a tool you can utilize to get more high-quality leads to your suppliers and hopefully more money in everyone’s pockets.</p><p>As you can see, even for marketplace getting to the right pricing scheme is immensely valuable!</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[How many layers of my BERT model should I freeze?]]>

December 7, 2020 | https://raphaelb.org/posts/freezing-bert/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raphaelb.org/posts/freezing-bert/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p><span>S</span>ince the advent of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) and of BERT models (Devlin et al. 2019), Transformer models have become ubiquitous in NLP, achieving SOTA results on most NLP datasets.</p>
<p>Before Sesame Street puppets flooded on ArXiv, the de-facto method to train an NLP model leveraged word embeddings pre-trained using Glove or word2vec. These word embeddings were used to initialize the first embedding layer of your model, and you just had to plug the rest of your architecture above this first layer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s increasingly common to use BERT-like language models trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text, and fine-tune the model on task-specific data. This change of paradigm led to a new subfield in NLP called BERTology which studies the ins and outs of BERT-like models.</p>
<p>Many hyper-parameters of BERT — such as the number of attention heads or the learning rate to use — have been studied, but few papers looked at how layer freezing affects performances.  Freezing layers means disabling gradient computation and backpropagation for the weights of these layers. This is a common technique in NLP or Computer Vision when working on small datasets as it usually reduces the chances of your model to overfit. Usually, models are frozen from bottom to top, as the first layers of neural networks are thought to encode universal features while the top layers are more task-specific. Another advantage of freezing is that it provides a nice speed boost and reduced memory usage during training.</p>
<p>Most machine learning teams in industry don’t have access to high-quality and domain-specific datasets. As the costs of building custom datasets are high, these datasets are usually way smaller than those often used in academia. Learning how to train better models with fewer data is a major concern, especially in industry. While the effect of freezing on performance has been explored (Lee, Tang, and Lin 2019), the low-resource setting hasn’t attracted much attention yet. Luckily, it’s what this post is all about 😎</p>

<p>To test how freezing affects performances when data is scarce, we will use the now popular <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗 Transformers library</a> from Hugging Face to train a RoBERTa model (base version) on two standard binary classification datasets from the GLUE benchmark: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability).</p>
<p>SST-2 is a sentiment analysis task and CoLA a dataset containing sentences labeled with respect to their grammatical acceptability (i.e whether each sentence is grammatically correct or not). SST-2 and CoLA contain ~51% and ~69% of positive samples respectively in their validation set, which gives us a majority class baseline to compare to. We will use accuracy as the metric of evaluation for both datasets.</p>
<p>We will train models with a subset of the training dataset and evaluate on the whole validation dataset. For CoLA and SST-2, we generate subsets of size 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking care that the fraction of positive samples is the same as in the original train dataset (stratify splitting)</li>
<li>generating the splits by increasing size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000) and reusing all samples from the previous split. By doing so, we limit the variability coming from using different samples in each split.</li>
</ul>
<p>To assess the impact of layer freezing on performances, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, or 12 encoder layers were frozen. I also tested to only freeze the embedding layers (frozen layers = -1).</p>
<p>Similar to the original RoBERTa paper (Liu et al. 2019), I fine-tuned for 10 epochs with a linear warmup of 1 epoch followed by a linear decay to zero. As my computational budget was limited, I didn’t perform any hyper-parameter search and stuck to the default values (<code>lr = 5e-5</code>, AdamW optimizer).</p>
<p>On both datasets, for each layer freezing value (-1, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12) and for each train size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000), 5 replicates were trained with a different random seed.</p>
<p>I decided to use the recent (and pretty awesome!) <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗Datasets</a> library — also developed by folks from Hugging Face — to easily fetch and process these two datasets:</p>

<p>Here comes the most interesting part!</p>
<p>Below is displayed for both datasets the best accuracy obtained during training on the development set for all train sizes and all numbers of frozen layers. Each red dot on the plot represents a single run.</p>
<p>The complete results can also be found as tables at the end of the post.</p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/sst2.png" alt="Results on SST-2"></p>
<p><em>SST-2: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/cola.png" alt="Results on CoLA"></p>
<p><em>CoLA: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p>As expected, having more data always help: we gain +0.15 (0.75 → 0.90) in accuracy by increasing dataset size from 50 to 1000 for SST-2.</p>
<p>Freezing all (12) layers of the encoder is definitely not a good idea when dealing with limited data: there is always a significant performance drop, and the resulting models are barely better than a majority class classifier. Freezing 10 layers is also associated with degraded accuracy, even if the effect isn’t as strong. Aside from 10- and 12-frozen layers, there are no clear impact of layer freezing on performances.</p>
<p>We also observe high variability in accuracy between runs with the same settings (but with different random seeds). This instability is known since the release of BERT. While catastrophic forgetting and the small sizes of datasets were first suspected as the causes of this instability, more recent work (Mosbach et al. 2020) suggests that optimization difficulties leading to vanishing gradients are the actual reasons. For both SST-2 and CoLA datasets, there are no clear evidence that freezing reduces these instabilities.</p>
<p>As a final note, the performance gap between SST-2 and CoLA with 50 examples is interesting: while best models for SST-2 classify 82% of samples correctly (with 51% of positive samples), best run are barely better than the majority class baseline with 70% of samples correctly classified. This is indicative of the inductive bias of these models, which are more prone to detect polarity than grammatical correctness.</p>

<p>And that’s all for this second post 😊!</p>
<p>The results of these experiments were surprising to me, I initially thought layer freezing would have a more visible impact on performances.</p>

It lists ~30 libraries for creating web components, comparing code style, performance and bundle size. One of the libraries got me intrigued - Stencil - which looks very promising and has lots of stars on GitHub - about 8.6k.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-m0td"><span><a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Stencil</u></span></a><span> is a React-inspired web component library. It is using the same JSX as React and some of the same concepts (Render function, props, state). However, Stencil differs as it compiles to an optimal bundle, creating Virtual DOM that is consolidated directly into the DOM itself (no VDOM to VDOM comparison). The result is standard web components with optimal performance.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-876ce"><span><span>On top, Stencil provides good development experience through their template applications - for building a component, a website / app or a PWA. Stencil also supports server-side rendering and hydrations for websites that need to be optimized for indexing.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4f7v9"><span><span>To learn Stencil, we decided to build yet another version of </span><a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC</u></span></a><span>. TodoMVC is a great platform to compare different javascript libraries - it </span>exposes<span> 54 Javascript UI libraries on one simple use case - a Todo list application.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.
As our favorite proverb goes, "you don't need lots of resources when all your content is static and you can get someone else to serve it for free".</p>
<p>We're pretty confident in our ability to scale our infrastructure in the event that more users join the service, as our VPS provider has a button we can press to make the server larger, solving all scalability problems once and for all.</p>
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After taking a look at <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/vue-overview/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/angular-overview/">Angular</a> it’s time to check out the last of the big three -  <strong>React</strong>. </p>
<p>In terms of popularity and user base it might be the biggest of the three so let’s look at how it got here. It’s also worth mentioning there has been a lot of discussion on if React is a framework or a library, with both sides of the argument nitpicking the definitions. How you call it isn’t really of the utmost importance when you’re actually using it, so let’s just call it a library since that’s how it’s referred to on its official website.</p>
<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook and it first appeared as FaxJS in 2011. The same year it got its first use in Facebook’s newsfeed and a year later on Instagram.com. May 2013 saw the big launch with React becoming opensource and publicly available, it was a bit of a rocky start with many being sceptical about its usefulness. Later the same year it became available in Python Applications and Ruby on Rails. By 2014 was steadily gaining users and the community started growing quickly. 2015 was the big break and the start of mainstream recognition as big companies like Netflix and Airbnb started using the library. The following years saw numerous improvements with the most recent version 17.0 coming out on October 20 2020.</p>
<h2>JSX and Virtual DOM</h2>
<p>Shedding some light on the background is fine and all, but the main ‘selling point’ (don’t worry, it’s opensource) of the library are its features. React is basically a frontend library aimed at helping developers build user interfaces. The most basic advantage, as with any library, is that it provides reusable code which saves time and reduces the chances of coding errors. Obviously that’s not all it does, ever since its initial release two features have been the backbone of React</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSX:</strong> React uses JSX (a syntax extension to JavaScript) instead of basic JavaScript for templating. It lets you easily modify the DOM using simple HTML-style code and is compatible with all web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React creates a data structure cache which traces the changes made and then updates only the relevant part of the DOM. Let’s say a user leaves a comment under the article, normally for it to appear the entire DOM would have to be updated, while React scans the DOM for changes and updates only the relevant segment. This makes for an important performance boost since it means way less computing power used and significantly shorter loading time. While that might not sound like much, think about the scale, we’re talking here about something made for Facebook and not some small blog with a handful of users commenting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Going native</h2>
<p>With the basic features out of the way we can look at some things that were added later. React Native was released in March 2015 letting developers create natively-rendered apps for iOS, Android and a multitude of other platforms. It quickly became one of the most used tools for mobile app development and was adopted by big companies like Skype, Soundcloud, Ubereats or Walmart. What’s the difference? Well ReactJS still uses some CSS and HTML elements while React Native uses native mobile UI elements. As cross-platform is very highly valued in mobile development it’s little wonder why it quickly became so popular.</p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>The new feature in version 16.8 released early last year was adding Hooks. Hooks are basically functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. This way you can ‘hook into’ React and use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components. They are reusable and provide better code composition and flexibility in moving around the component tree. With Hooks functional components can be used for almost everything from rendering UI to handling state and logic. You’ll find some built-in Hooks shipped with React and since they are reusable you’ll find lots of useful ones created by others or you can always create your own. There are two main rules to Hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions</strong> - this ensures that Hooks are called in the right order each time a component renders and their state is preserved between multiple calls.</li>

<p>Version 17.0 was released about a month and a half ago and it was the first major release without any developer-facing features. The update was primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. It’s not like that’s it though, the team even called this update a stepping stone while they work on new features. So if those mentioned above did not convince you there’s more coming soon. Oh and if you’re up for some more convincing, next time we’ll take a look at some of the most useful component libraries for React.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://dmellonielet.com/images/onboarding.jpg" alt="WFH!" title="Photo by XPS on Unsplash"></p>

<p>Career moves like starting a new role are challenging, can often be unnerving, and for sure requires leveling up. <img title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A few months back, I accepted an offer with another business group at Intel. To me, it was a great way of exploring new opportunities within the company and experiencing another flavor of its engineering culture. This new role was a scale-up from my previous one, a lot of new areas for me to contribute, learn, and explore.</p>

<p>What helped me tackle this was defining how I onboarded in the new role. In this article, I am sharing the framework and ideas from my onboarding learnings.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-done-right">Onboarding done right</h2>

<p>A well-defined onboarding is crucial to provide team members with the resources they need to succeed and ensure their expectations match the reality of the organization. It also clears any confusion about the role. Not having the right onboarding experience can often lead to not clearly understanding the new work environment leading to one as the wrong fit for the team.</p>

<p>Usually, onboarding has two distinct &amp; complementary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Onboarding</strong>: Getting familiar with the company culture, vision, mission, value, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Role-specific Onboarding</strong>: Acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to master the role effectively and efficiently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Joining a new team brings in a plethora of information and emotions and can be quite stressful. If you are reading this as someone who needs to onboard a team member, I highly encourage taking some time to think through the prep work covering basics for onboarding. At the end of the article, I have listed some useful resources for the same.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is someone (particularly a software engineer) who will be onboarding a new role.</p>

<h2 id="the-onboarding-template-page_with_curl">The onboarding template <img title=":page_with_curl:" alt=":page_with_curl:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c3.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-expectations-with-yourself">1. Set expectations with yourself</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” ― Paulo Coelho <img title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important thing is setting expectations for your new role. Sure, you have done quite some assessment before accepting the offer. However, this step talks about goal setting before your first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-clear-expectations-with-your-manager">2. Set clear expectations with your manager</h3>

<p>Well, you have cracked the role owing to your strengths and the value you potentially bring to the team. Hence, it is vital to discuss the expectations of onboarding with your manager. A few questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you suggest I focus on for my first week and month in this team?</li>
  <li>How can I learn more about the project(s)?</li>
  <li>Is there a team ‘how-to’ document I can refer to?</li>
  <li>Who is my dedicated buddy for onboarding?</li>
  <li>What accesses a new member needs to request?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-create-a-plan">3. Create a plan</h3>

<p>Now that you have a fair idea of the expectations, chart out an onboarding plan. It helps to list out activities to not be overwhelmed and create a to-do list to cover all essential tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-meet-with-as-many-team-members-as-to-familiarize">4. Meet with as many team members as to familiarize</h3>

<p>In the pre-covid world, face to face introductions were much easier. It’s not quite the same in a remote environment.
Make it a point to proactively reach out to as many team members/ stakeholders and set introductory 1:1s to learn about them, get a preliminary idea of the project, learn more about their preferred working times/ style, etc. This is an opportunity to get started on the technical details about the systems, projects, etc., and also provides a window into other team members’ interests.</p>

<h3 id="5-work-with-your-buddy-on-the-team">5. Work with your buddy on the team</h3>

<p>“There is no such thing as a stupid question!”</p>

<p>It can be a bit daunting to ping someone with a question that feels stupid to ask even if it is not. A dedicated buddy on the new team makes it easier to figure out the correct point of contact for your questions. A buddy can help understand communication dynamics within and across the teams, help understand the company/ team abbreviations &amp; acronyms, guide you on your tasks, etc.</p>

<h3 id="6-ask-questions-a-lot-of-them">6. Ask questions.. A lot of them</h3>

<p>Your imposter syndrome sure will not kick in until the first week or two. Maybe it won’t kick in at all. But if you are venturing out for something new, more often it does. A great tip for dealing with this is to be fearless and ask questions (<em>again..there are no stupid questions..</em>). The more you can familiarize yourself with the new team, the project, and the business, the better. It may not all make sense to you all at once but keep notes. Eventually, it will all come together.</p>

<p>It also helps to schedule regular 1:1s with members of your team and driving the agenda on things you wish to understand in the project.
Another great way to learn fast is to shadow experienced team members on tasks, understand their thought process, watch them debug issues, understand their communication style.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-the-documentation-and-code">7. Read the documentation and code</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to read the documentation and code. The information you have heard from your teammates will now start making more sense. Additionally, this will help you recognize potential improvements in the documentation/ codebase for future contributions.</p>

<h3 id="8-contribute">8. Contribute</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to do. Nothing beats the feeling of your first commit in the new project- be it a bug fix, a small feature enhancement, documentation improvements, etc. Channel your doer mindset and look for ways to make things better.</p>

<h3 id="9-seek-feedback">9. Seek feedback</h3>

<p>In a loop of continuous improvement, nothing triumphs feedback. Seek constructive feedback from your manager, your teammates on what you did better and what are your blind spots. Where can you improve as well as discuss what challenges you are facing and how can you address them?</p>

<p>Good feedback is a two-way conversation. Not only should you receive feedback but also provide it. Be open to sharing what you learned through the onboarding process, what can potentially improve for the future, how did your team members help you feel comfortable with the process, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning your onboarding can contribute to your success in the role and can bring joy. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c8.png" height="20" width="20"> I hope these tips and ideas can help new engineers navigate the onboarding successfully.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum is resin&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Mastic tree found on the Greek island Chios. It's been labelled as a superfood because of its numerous health&nbsp;properties- which we'll talk about in just a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the last 5 years its popularity has skyrocketed for&nbsp;a reason no Greek farmer could have ever expected.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>It can sharpen your jawline</em></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People are catching on to an old BodyBuilder method for building muscle in the jawline- chewing mastic gum! Because it's 10x harder than regular gum it's basically like taking your jaw to the gym.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently this is relatively well-known in Hollywood and the BodyBuilding space. Now it's&nbsp;making its way into the mainstream. More on that later. First you've got to understand where it comes from to know why it's so special:</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>he people of Chios have&nbsp;cultivated and harvested mastic or "Mastiha" for over 2500 years. The hot and humid climate is ideal for the 6-month, laborious process.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_0706dfc7-3e37-472b-9669-5ec2e9f92bad_480x480.jpg?v=1607283273" alt="Farmers harvesting chios resin"></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Every 4-5 days, several&nbsp;cuts are made in the trees to slowly drain the resin. It takes roughly 15-20 days for the crystal to solidify and fall off. Because of the way it falls from the tree and it's shape, these small pieces of resin are called "Tears of Chios". The farmers then collect these small teardrops and wash them in natural spring water.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>It&nbsp;has a refreshing pine/cedar flavour.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>M</strong>astic's earliest identified uses was as chewing gum- the additional benefits were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic producing villages&nbsp;were fortresses,&nbsp;bordered by huge walls. The only way to enter these villages was by ladder, designed to shield the resin from invaders.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre"><strong>wars were fought over mastic gum</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Ottoman rule of Chios in the 1800s, mastic was <strong>worth its weight in Gold.&nbsp;</strong>In todays gold prices that means 1 piece would cost $59.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for us, it doesn't cost that much. But with its growing popularity, maybe someday it might. Let's talk about <em>why </em>it's selling out around the world:</p>



<p><strong>T</strong>he ancient Mediterraneans loved mastic and thought it had "magic" healing properties. Thanks to modern science we know today how that "magic" works. Here's the 7 main health benefits we use it for today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#dental">Aids Dental Health</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#inflammation">Anti-Inflammatory</a></strong></li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#cholesterol">Lowers Cholesterol &amp;</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;Blood Sugar</strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="#biotic">Anti-Biotic&nbsp;/ Anti-Fungal</a></strong></li>

<li><strong><a href="#cancer">Cancer Preventative</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#asthma">Asthma Treatment</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Here's The "Magical" Ingredients (Skip If Boring)</b></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic gum is composed of several bioactive compounds responsible for its numerous health benefits. These include <em>triterpenic acids</em> (TAs) such as <em>isomasticadienolic acid</em> as well as triterpenes. These are natural antibiotics that also act as strong anti-inflammatories.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastiha naturally&nbsp;contains large percentages of organic compounds like Terpenoids, which add to its aromatic element. The main active Terpenoids include&nbsp;<em>alpha-pinene</em> (40%), <em>beta-myrcene</em>, <em>beta-pinene</em>, <em>limonene</em>, and <em>beta-caryophyllene</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Alpha-pinene</em> is also found in pines and rosemary. It's what gives Mastic a fresh pine/cedar flavor.&nbsp;As well as providing a strong woody aroma, it's also a potent topical antiseptic. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike regular chewing gums, which are</span><span>&nbsp;filled with artificial coloring and flavors, <strong>mastic gum&nbsp;is 100% natural.</strong></span></p>


<h2 id="dental"><span>1. Aids Dental Health (Prevent Cavities)</span></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>here are&nbsp;multiple studies about Mastic gum and its positive effect on dental health.&nbsp;A <span><a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/angle-orthodontist/article/77/1/124/58081/Short-term-Effect-of-Mastic-Gum-on-Salivary">2007 study</a>&nbsp;</span>found that chewing&nbsp;mastic gum may potentially help prevent teeth cavities by&nbsp;reducing bacteria in the mouth and the pH of saliva.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/Tooth-decay-diagram_b8ee88bd-931a-4d5d-b51e-ad0d796e9211_480x480.jpg?v=1607283312" alt="Diagram of tooth decay"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum has been shown to reduce the build-up of plaque</em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing mastic gum for 15 minutes, participants in the study were found to have lower levels of&nbsp;</span><em>lactobacilli</em> and <em>S Mutans</em> in the oral cavity. The rate of bacteria levels even remained low even 2.25 hours later. This same effect was further supported by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281189/">2014 study</a></span>.</p>
<p>What this means for you is:</p>
<h3><strong>Mastic Gum Prevents Cavities And Bad Breath</strong></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There's no need to worry about chewing a random resin that came from a tree in Greece- it's recommended by dentists!</p>
<p>Just chew it&nbsp;like a regular piece of gum and chuck it when you're done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WEIRD FACT:&nbsp;</strong>you can swallow mastic gum! It can be broken down by your stomach like any other food because it's 100% natural.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="inflammation"><strong>2. Anti-Inflammatory (Heal Faster)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic's anti-inflammatory properties may help with autoimmune illness&nbsp;and chronic inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It decreases the levels of various inflammatory substances and blocks inflammatory pathways. It also aids the activation of neutrophils which is a type of white blood cell.</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8"><br>
<h2 id="cholesterol">
<span>3.&nbsp;Lower Cholesterol &amp; Blood Sugar&nbsp;</span>(Healthier Heart)</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>O</strong>ur modern lazy-lifestyles and unnatural diet have made high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels commonplace. These two things increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest that chewing mastic gum could help&nbsp;restore these levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487315603186">2015 study</a></span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;<span>with</span>&nbsp;156 healthy individuals found that daily mastic consumption lead to lower total cholesterol levels. These results were observed after 8 weeks.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2047487315603186">2016&nbsp;study</a></span>, people who took mastic&nbsp;in some form also experienced lower blood glucose levels which are&nbsp;sometimes associated with high cholesterol levels. Mastic was found to have&nbsp;a greater effect on people who are overweight or obese.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="biotic"><strong>4. Anti-Biotic / Anti-Fungal (Good For Everything)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>B</strong>alancing our body's bacteria is a crucial function of our diet. Mastic has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that&nbsp;serve as a&nbsp;cure for several ailments.</p>

<h3>Soothing Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to&nbsp;help in treating symptoms of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A well-known <span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a>&nbsp;</span>conducted in 1984 on 38 people demonstrated that 1 gram of mastic gum taken daily, results in reduction of ulcer symptoms in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Reducing Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria In The Stomach</strong></h3>
<p><span>Helicobacter pylori bacteria infections are a major risk factor that can contribute to stomach ulcers. If left unchecked, t</span>hese bacteria&nbsp;may potentially lead to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic gum's antibacterial capabilities against&nbsp;<i><span>H. pylori </span></i>have been shown to mitigate these risks. A<span> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711309002396?via%3Dihub">study</a></span>&nbsp;from 2010, found that mastic gum destroyed&nbsp;H. pylori colonies faster than a placebo in a 14 day period.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="digestion">
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</strong>
</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic gum's most common use (for health purposes) throughout history has been as a cure for digestive problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One<span> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a></span> found that 1g of mastic gum a day, led to fewer stomach aches and heartburn in volunteers. If you read <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mastic+gum&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></span> reviews for Mastiha and mastic gum, you will find hundreds of cases where it has cured men and women's ulcers and digestion problems:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/amazon-review-for-mastic-gum_480x480.png?v=1607283351" alt="Amazon review of mastic gum"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum is an almost "magical" cure for stomach ulcers&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Helps Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3>
<p>New research presented in <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/">2015 review</a></span> suggests that mastic gum can help with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;A study conducted on 60 people with IBD found that individuals who consumed mastic in any form had&nbsp;measurable improvements in their IBD inflammation markers such as&nbsp;</span><span>decreased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein. This was over a 3 week period.</span></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="cancer"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cancer Preventative</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>R</strong>esearchers</span>&nbsp;are currently investigating mastic gum’s role in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer. According to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.21935"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2006 study</span>,</a> mastic gum can inhibit an androgen receptor that could have an effect on the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to weaken the function of the androgen receptor in&nbsp;these&nbsp;cancer cells. More recent<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951764/"><span>laboratory studies</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;have uncovered more about how this effect works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476564/">Research from 2017</a>&nbsp;</span>suggests that mastic&nbsp;may also help suppress the growth of tumors that can lead to colon cancer. Researchers found that mastic inhibited the increase of colon cells. It has been show to&nbsp;inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma tumors.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="asthma"><strong>7. Asthma Treatment</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum's anti-inflammatory properties may make it useful in treating<span>&nbsp;allergenic asthma</span>. This type of asthma often includes airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2010-0212OC">2011 study</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;</span>on mice, mastic gum significantly inhibited eosinophilia, reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, and blocked the production of inflammatory substances. It had a positive effect on lung fluid and lung inflammation. In vitro tests found that mastic gum inhibited cells that react negatively to allergens and cause airway inflammation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These results are promising but further studies are needed to determine efficacy in human cases.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><span><strong>G</strong>enerally well-tolerated and 100% natural, mastic and&nbsp;doesn't have any major reported side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In some rare cases, it may cause dizziness, headache, or an upset stomach. These cases are likely due to increased tension in the muscles surrounding your skull because mastic gum is so much harder than what we are accustomed to chewing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Start with a small quantity and see how your body reacts to it</strong>.&nbsp; Once you're sure there's no&nbsp;negative&nbsp;effects you can gradually increase the dose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's always possible to have an allergic reaction to something new</span><span>. So monitor how you feel and consult a doctor if you're concerned.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>You shouldn’t take mastic gum if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.</span>&nbsp;</p>

It gives me perspectives on issues that could be getting carried over from the previous week and any critical changes I should be aware of.
Although you can’t plan for all that happens during an oncall week, a proper handoff helps you prepare for it.</p><h3 id="organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</h3><p>As an SRE on LinkedIn’s container scheduler and deployment infrastructure team, our users are engineers at LinkedIn. We use Slack for internal communication and we have certain channels where users share issues they are experiencing with the tooling or to get our oncall’s attention. During an oncall week, I star these channels and organize my sidebar so that I can easily notice messages from our users and distinguish them from the other messages I receive. As an optional tip - I also like to mute/leave channels that I am not actively participating in to reduce clutter.</p><p>As compared to a normal week, I spend more time on Slack when I am oncall - responding to people, answering support requests, helping users with tooling. These Slack notifications can create a little bit of distraction, however, considering all our users are internal, a rise in messages on our channels can also indicate that something might be wrong with our system and our alerting hasn’t caught it yet.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/slack-pings.gif" alt="slack pings during oncall"></p><h2 id="signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</h2><h3 id="trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</h3><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/trust-but-verify-you-must.jpg" alt="trust-but-verify-you-must"></p><p><i>This is something I learned during my interview at LinkedIn and it has been very applicable in my experience since.</i></p><p>In early days of oncall and incident management, it is very common to feel as if things are on fire when any alert gets triggered. Over time, I have realized that gaining context and verifying that the alert is actually indicating an issue helps with the right next steps. It is important to distinguish signal from noise because:</p><ul><li>An alert could be non-actionable as it was recently configured with a threshold that’s making it too noisy</li><li>The monitoring stack is down and the alert is being triggered because the configuration treats a lack of data points as an issue</li><li>Your service is operating perfectly fine, however, the traffic tier routing requests to your service had an issue</li><li>Timer on a deliberately silenced alert expired and the alert started triggering</li></ul><p>I have experienced all of the above at some point in time. Now when I either receive an alert or a user reports an issue, I check our services (metrics, logs, reproduce the reported problem etc.) to verify that the issue is real.</p><h3 id="declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</h3><p>Not all actionable alerts result in an incident. To be effective at identifying the ones that do, it is extremely crucial to think about the bigger picture of mitigating the issue than be overwhelmed by the technical task of resolving the alert.</p><p>Some of the qualitative measures that help make this differentiation is to consider whether an issue requires coordinating the fix with other teams or whether the issue is impacting customers or violating an SLO. If any of the conditions are true, declare an incident. It is always better to declare an incident early in the process than waiting too long.</p><p>At LinkedIn, we have defined guidelines for all teams about what warrants an incident along with different levels of severity. This takes guesswork out of the picture, and provides a shared understanding to every team member.</p><h2 id="communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</h2><h3 id="the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</h3><p>Every incident gets a title. I didn’t realize it initially, but giving an incident a title forces one to define the problem and communicate it to the stakeholders very succinctly. When communicating to stakeholders, <strong>scoping the incident is very important</strong>. What I mean by scoping is identifying how big the impact is - which environment is impacted, is the impact limited to a region or is it global, how many customers are impacted, etc. For instance, “the login feature on the site is not working” vs “the login feature on the site is not working for traffic originating from Asia Pacific” say two very different things.</p><h3 id="establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</h3><p>We heavily rely on Slack to communicate during an incident. A dedicated slack channel helps focus all the energy and inputs from everyone in one place. It helps the incident lead collect data about symptoms that the users are experiencing and also captures a log of considered/discarded hypotheses and any changes made to the system. Once the Slack channel is created, establish an incident lead and let everyone know who is driving the incident forward.</p><p>Eslablishing explicit comms channels for reporting and identifying issues and establishing an incident lead reduce the delay in action and disambiguate any confusion.</p><h3 id="communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</h3><p>If there’s a fix you’d like to try out, let others know who are and encourage everyone to do the same. This ensures that the potential fix doesn’t make an already bad situation worse and helps catch any blind spots early. If you do end up making a change to the system after getting consensus, let others know and follow up on its effects.</p><h3 id="provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</h3><p>While working towards a resolution for the incident, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the technical details and miss to communicate an update. This leads to angry leadership and annoyed customers who have no insight into what’s happening.</p><p>An update provides visibility to the customers that the issue is being worked upon and lets the leadership identify if they can help out with anything. Depending on the severity of the incident, an update every 15-30 mins serves pretty well. The update doesn’t have to be extremely detailed, rather a brief summary describing the current state and immediate next steps is sufficient. An example update:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Our hypothesis about the memory leak checks out and we have validated the fix in the staging environment. We have pushed out the change and as soon as it goes through the CI pipeline, we’ll canary the new release, monitor metrics and promote the change after verifying the fix.</p></blockquote><h2 id="incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</h2><h3 id="get-help-early">Get help early</h3><p>In my earlier days, I used to think that it was solely my responsibility to mitigate the issue, find the root cause, and roll out the fix. If I couldn’t do it, it wouldn’t reflect well on me. In reality, incident management, like much of software development, is a very collaborative process.</p><p>One of the big differences in how I approach it now is I focus on actively pulling in other engineers who could help with debugging or resolving the issue early in the process. This change in perspective has relieved me of a lot of unnecessary stress and also made me more effective at resolving incidents.</p><p>When requesting help, be specific about the task as well as the urgency. It helps others calibrate their response and manage things they might have at hand.</p><h3 id="working-with-others">Working with others</h3><p>One of the most important things while handling incidents is working with others. Considering the multi-faceted nature of an SRE role, it’s one of the most important while underrated skills.</p><p>With multiple people involved, various possibilities get shared and one of the responsibilities of the incident lead is to guide these discussions in a productive direction while filtering out the noise. One should be cautious about going down any rabbit holes and focus on stopping the bleeding first. If there’s a probable cause, share it early - it helps rule out possibilities. And it’s okay to ask questions that seem obvious, but specific questions are more helpful.</p><p>Being fearlessly curious, and keeping an open mind enables one to consider possibilities that could be overseen otherwise. Remember, you are working together as a team on sharing and ruling out hypotheses to solve a challenging problem.</p><h3 id="video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video Conferencing is your friend</h3><p>We …</p></div></div>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

			<p>In 1995 LEGO conducted a study to determine how to become “digital” – how to do it and what it would take. This study took place from May to October in a secret lab on the third floor of LEGO&nbsp;headquarters, Legocentret. At the end of the study LEGO&nbsp;management received a report detailing programs, people, and resources needed to move into the new paradigm. LEGO&nbsp;quickly approved the plan, and SPU-Darwin was set in motion at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>This website is the story of SPU-Darwin, of moving LEGO&nbsp;into the 21st century. I’m not sure yet how to tell that story, so it’s organized as a blog. This will allow me to present pieces of history as they come, without worrying about having to have everything set before presenting anything, and will allow me to experiment with presentations. Also, a great deal of leading edge science and engineering had to be developed, and those stories will require intense technical material, which might not appeal to everyone, and those entries will be separate from the general ones.</p>

<p>To Darwin members: the blog structure of this website is expressly designed to allow everyone to chime in with their memories. Please do that. Periodically I’ll go through the topics and concentrate them down into organized stories. It’s my hope that this path will eventually lead to an actual publication someday, like an interactive multimedia book, but we’ll worry about that later.</p>
<p>I’m not a designer, so if you’d like to contribute anything about this website design, PLEASE do so.</p>
<p>Note: only Darwin members (which is not just LEGO employees, it’s everyone who was intimately involved – this means you, SGI and Informix and DDE) will have editing access. Everyone else can email, which will be dealt with separately.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

<p>Sunday December 6, 2020</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://planspace.org/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="https://planspace.org/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>

<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#9" name="9">9</a>. Work hard</h3>
<p>You need to focus. You need to put in time and effort. Sometimes you
have to stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. There is no royal
road. Work harder than anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#10" name="10">10</a>. Relax</h3>
<p>Take some time to change the nature of your focus on the problem. Pull
back from single-minded concentration. Don't focus on anything else
either. Relax. Don't micromanage your brain. What comes to you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#11" name="11">11</a>. Work smart</h3>
<p>Even if you're already making progress, is there something you could
do more effectively? Can you find a better process if you reconsider?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#12" name="12">12</a>. Find support</h3>
<p>What would help you to be effective? Is there a group or team you can
join or form? What people or other resources can you engage with?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#13" name="13">13</a>. Understand the problem</h3>
<p>Do you completely understand what you're working on? Are all the
definitions clear? Does everyone involved agree on the problem
statement and objective?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#14" name="14">14</a>. Find roots</h3>
<p>What is the root cause (or causes) of the problem? Is the problem as
stated the real problem? How did the problem come to be? Keep asking
why.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#15" name="15">15</a>. Know what you know</h3>
<p>What do you know, and how do you know it? Are you sure? Could you
explain it to someone else? What do you not know, and how could you
come to know it? What else might be relevant?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#16" name="16">16</a>. Question assumptions</h3>
<p>What are you taking for granted? What is so obvius that you haven't
thought about it? What biases might be affecting your thinking? Are
there alternatives that seem "out there"?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#17" name="17">17</a>. Find similar problems</h3>
<p>Do you know a related problem? What have others done in similar
situations? How is a similar problem solved in nature, or in another
field? Can you build on work you or others have done before?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#18" name="18">18</a>. Consider quitting</h3>
<p>Is this a problem that shouldn't be solved? Is this problem the right
use of your time, right now? What if you didn't solve this particular
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#19" name="19">19</a>. Get an easy win</h3>
<p>Find a task that you can succeed at in the next two minutes. It could
be getting out a pen, or opening a book. Do it, then praise yourself
for that victory. It may be easier to keep making progress afterward.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#20" name="20">20</a>. Start things cooking</h3>
<p>Many tasks involve some waiting after you initiate them, like waiting
for food to marinate, or waiting for responses to an email. Make a
point to get these things started as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#21" name="21">21</a>. Take a step</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure of your whole plan, do something now. You can
always reevaluate afterward. Choose some goal that you can accomplish,
and do it now.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#22" name="22">22</a>. Do an experiment</h3>
<p>You don't have to only do things that you know will work. Try
something and see what happens. Be prepared to throw it away. You'll
learn from it and it will help you to make progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#23" name="23">23</a>. Guess and check</h3>
<p>A particular kind of experiment is to choose a next step, even if you
don't know that it's right, and see what happens next. Follow the
consequences forward. Even if you guessed wrong, you'll learn
something.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#24" name="24">24</a>. Write down what you’ve done</h3>
<p>Keep some log of what you've been doing, what you've tried, and what
the results have been. If you haven't been doing this, try to remember
and write down what you've done so far.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#25" name="25">25</a>. Try again</h3>
<p>Sometimes when you try something and it doesn't work, it isn't that
the approach was bad, it's that something didn't align that time. It
could be worth trying again, especially with things you tried when you
knew less.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#26" name="26">26</a>. Zoom in</h3>
<p>How close can you get to the tiniest pieces? What happens for exactly
one component? For a global problem, how does a single individual play
a part on a daily basis?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#27" name="27">27</a>. Zoom out</h3>
<p>What's the big picture? How does the problem fit into larger systems?
What's the global view? What's the long term view?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#28" name="28">28</a>. Draw a picture</h3>
<p>Make a graphical representation. It could be a sketch, a plot, a
diagram, a mind map, a flow chart. Make something you can see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#29" name="29">29</a>. Change representations</h3>
<p>What's another way to conceptualize the problem? In math, you might
switch between numeric, geometric, and algebraic forms. You might
change domains, or phrase the problem as a story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#30" name="30">30</a>. Use a different tool</h3>
<p>Try saying it out loud. Try typing, or writing longhand, or recording
a video. Try post-it notes or index cards. Try paper and pencil, or a
calculator, a diagramming tool, or a programming language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#31" name="31">31</a>. Use analogy</h3>
<p>What else is this like? Can you compare to something else, even if
it's a stretch? What do the similarities and differences tell you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#32" name="32">32</a>. Change viewpoints</h3>
<p>How does this look from different perspectives? How do different
people, pieces, places see the problem? Can you imagine yourself in
different positions?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#33" name="33">33</a>. Organize concepts</h3>
<p>What's the deep structure of this problem? Can you model the problem?
Are there axes or other ways of representing the ideas of your
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#34" name="34">34</a>. Add randomness</h3>
<p>Consider something you wouldn't otherwise: a random word, WikiPedia
article, or the concept of randomness itself. Go to a museum, or a
store. Whatever you find, relate it to your problem. What could it
mean?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#35" name="35">35</a>. Talk it through</h3>
<p>Have a conversation with someone. Or imagine a conversation with
someone. Or have a conversation with yourself. Explain everything
you're thinking about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#36" name="36">36</a>. Decompose/Recompose</h3>
<p>What are the words and ideas that you're using? Are they cliché? Are
they appropriate? What if you broke down the way you're understanding
the problem and rebuilt it? Can you articulate the problem and
solution spaces?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#37" name="37">37</a>. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Get an outside view on your problem and your work on it. Try to
solicit feedback that helps you see things you aren't otherwise
seeing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#38" name="38">38</a>. Learn more</h3>
<p>You may not know enough to solve your problem, and you may not even
know what it is that you don't know. Keep learning! Be curious about
topics near and far. Read and study for pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#39" name="39">39</a>. Ask for help</h3>
<p>Other people can help you a lot. Put effort into finding the right
place and way to ask, and others will often put effort into helping
you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#40" name="40">40</a>. Break it up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can break big problems into many more manageable steps.
It may even be possible for multiple people to work on separate parts.
Regardless, pursue and celebrate partial progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#41" name="41">41</a>. Use inversion</h3>
<p>How might you achieve the opposite of your goal? Are there other
reversals or inversions that might be illuminating? What's the worst
case outcome? Can you avoid it?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#42" name="42">42</a>. Make a list</h3>
<p>Generate lots of ideas. What are all the options? Consider more
possibilities. What else could you make a list of?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#43" name="43">43</a>. Eliminate possibilities</h3>
<p>What can you rule out? What hasn't worked already? What's impossible?
What has to be wrong? Why is that? What are the constraints? What can
you learn from what doesn't work?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#44" name="44">44</a>. Work backward</h3>
<p>Assume you have a solution. How would it come to be? What would
immediately lead to it? Can you follow steps backward from the end?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#45" name="45">45</a>. Consider special cases</h3>
<p>Are there some specific forms of the problem that are more tractable
or help with understanding? Can you extend a method based on these?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#46" name="46">46</a>. Consider extremes</h3>
<p>What if something in your problem disappeared, or was huge? What if
the problem itself was much worse, or more minor?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#47" name="47">47</a>. Add a constraint</h3>
<p>Add a deadline for something. Can you come up with ten ideas in ten
minutes? What if you have to be done today? What if your techniques or
resources were limited? What if you couldn't use a tool you're
currently using?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#48" name="48">48</a>. Simplify</h3>
<p>In what ways could a complicated problem be made less so? What does
simplifying it mean? Can you solve the simpler problem? If so, is that
good enough, or is there a way to build on the solution?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#49" name="49">49</a>. Generalize</h3>
<p>Can you make your problem a special case of some other problem? Can
you solve that problem? Maybe a general-purpose tool or approach can
be used or adapted for your problem.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#50" name="50">50</a>. Change the goal</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't need to solve exactly the problem you started with.
What's most important? Can you focus on that? Can you compromise to
find something that you can make progress on?</p>

<p>Google is the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/">most widely-used search engine</a> in the world, and the company now offers hundreds of other services and products on top of search-based advertising. Personally, I think Google has done a great job improving search over the past two decades, but we are reaching a point where Google’s interests are colliding with offering honest search results to users.</p>
<h2 id="googles-competing-services">Google’s Competing Services</h2>
<p>All the way back in 2012, Yelp’s IPO statement cited Google as both its <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/399831-yelp-has-a-google-problem">biggest asset for gaining new users as well as its biggest competitor</a>. Because the site was the largest local business review site when it went public, it gathered much of its traffic from users who use Google to search for nearby businesses - especially those without a website or strong social media presence.</p>
<p>Since Yelp launched, Google has released its own competing review aggregator, which means that if Google wanted, they could force their results to the top of the list every time. This could effectively <em>kill</em> Yelp’s ability to get new users, and raises a lot of questions about Google’s monopoly on search and its effect on internet businesses.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phones-and-search-engines">Smart Phones and Search Engines</h2>
<p>A more recent frontier in the fight against Google is on smart phones. In 2020, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">brought a lawsuit against the search giant</a> accusing them of “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices,” related to the pressure they allegedly put on phone makers to default to their search engine.</p>
<p>Because Google owns one of the two biggest mobile operating systesm (Android), they have a lot of power to push users towards their search engine. It’s possible that this latest lawsuit could result in a large judgment against the company. A similar lawsuit <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-fines-google-51b-for-abuse-of-power">filed in the European Union in 2018</a> led Google to change the way it bundles apps on Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-wiki-model-for-search">The Wiki Model for Search</h2>
<p>As Google’s intentions to integrate search with its own services more deeply has become clear, and I’ve been considering what a non profit search engine might look like.</p>
<p>A great model to look at for guidance is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the non-profit internet encyclopedia. Could having a crowdsourced, community-funded non-profit search engine be the way to save search engines from becoming cogs in a corporate advertising machine?</p>
<h3 id="spinning-off-a-not-for-profit-search-engine">Spinning Off a Not For Profit Search Engine</h3>
<p>Realistically, it’s not likely that a new competitor will be able to enter the search engine market and make any impact on Google’s market share. But, the US Justice Department or EU could split the company up.</p>
<p>For example, they could break Google up into multiple companies like they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">did to the telephone companies in the 1980s</a>, or Google search could be turned into a public utility. This is <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/competition/030819-antitrust-in-60-seconds-public-utility-regulation/">how electric companies became publicly supported infrastructure</a>, so it’s not impossible that it could happen again.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-a-non-profit-search-engine-work">How Would a Non Profit Search Engine Work?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a non-profit search engine would allow users to drive improvements to the algorithm by reporting bad results or collaborating on improvements.</p>
<p>I would envision a core team with many contributors - much like open-source projects hosted on Github. While the basic functionality (crawling, link-tracking, etc.) would be the same as a search engine like Google, an impartial not for profit search engine could sidestep privacy pitfalls like Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">SPYW</a> and the aforementioned Yelp problem.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for abuse in this system as well, but there are numerous improvements to be had in a publicly visible model like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-option-today">The Best Option Today</h2>
<p>The closest thing we have today is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which is closed-source and for-profit, but does not store personal data. This gives users some of the privacy-focused features that a non profit search engine might provide, but doesn’t answer the potential for abuse or eventual monopoly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkT1Ljn.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search engine"></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent 3 months exclusively using DuckDuckGo as my search engine of choice. As a programmer, it was really challenging though. Google’s results have lots of context about my browsing behaviors, but DuckDuckGo doesn’t, so it takes a little massaging to get the results you might expect.</p>
<p>That said, DuckDuckGo did much better for non-technical search queries. For example, “watch Breaking Bad” takes you to a list of places you can watch the TV show “Breaking Bad.” The results are similar enough to Google’s that you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should there be a major player in the search engine market that is not for profit? Is it even necessary? Let me hear your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an important trade-off you need to make in order to be more creative: you need to be willing to <em>feel</em> less productive.</p>



<p>I say “feel” instead of “be” because productivity can be a really subjective and delusive game.</p>



<p>Even though efficiency freaks like to measure everything, what usually determines whether they were productive or not is their expectations. And those tend to be very high.</p>



<p>You should definitely work on adjusting your expectations about productivity. But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is learn how to deal with unproductive guilt.</p>



<p>Because being more creative inevitably requires engaging in “unproductive” behaviors. Like sleeping, going for a walk (without your phone) or meditating.</p>



<p>Creativity is an unconscious and organic process. A great deal of the action happens behind the scenes. And like nature, it works on its own schedule.</p>



<p>You can foster and nurture creativity. But you can’t rush it.</p>



<p>Your mind needs time and space to chew experiences and information, process them, and make novel, interesting connections.</p>



<p>“Productive” people call it procrastination. For creatives, it is the making of a new idea.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Economist Noah Smith <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-change-isnt-that-hard">is fed up with</a> generic critiques of technological “solutionism,” specifically what he calls the “2010s consensus that technology is a sideshow compared to social movements.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">"The new normal" has become part of our lexicon this year, in all areas of life.&nbsp;</p>

Will companies determine that workers are just as productive from home and fully embrace remote work? Will consumers permanently close the door on shopping at brick-and-mortar stores in favor of ordering groceries and supplies online?</p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">To investigate the means through which these shifts could happen—and the likelihood that they will—we identified three main ways the coronavirus could shape the economy long after the pandemic has subsided:</p>

As an example of the impact of habits, consider the rise of recycling in the United States over the past several decades. This shift was due in part to the advent of Earth Day in 1970 and the nationwide campaign encouraging Americans to "reduce, reuse, recycle."&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/2015_smm_msw_factsheet_07242018_fnl_508_002.pdf" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-e8029e64="">The Environmental Protection Agency</a>&nbsp;reported that 34.7% of municipal solid waste was recycled in 2015, as compared with 6.6% in 1970.</li>

This led to a permanent reduction in cigarette sales—approximately 42% of U.S. adults smoked in 1964, compared with approximately 19% in 2011.</li>
<li data-v-e8029e64="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><strong>Sunk costs</strong>, or costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recouped, could change the long-term plans of consumers and firms. A classic example of sunk costs is the Concorde.

<div data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><p><span>Habits have evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of social distancing concerns, as many people have cut back on normal activities such as eating at restaurants, traveling by air, attending large events, and shopping at physical stores.</span></p><p><span>Will this short-term shift in habits lead to long-term changes in consumer behaviour? Companies and industries impacted by this reduction in demand are&nbsp;</span><a tabindex="0" href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1003476/33-undervalued-stocks-for-the-fourth-quarter" data-v-55c87dd6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">underperforming in the market</a><span>, implying that investors think it will.</span></p><p><span>Many of the industries shaped by changes in habits are the same ones that could be impacted by fear of the next pandemic or a COVID-19 resurgence. It's difficult to predict how this fear will shape consumer behaviour—especially once an effective vaccine is developed and distributed—but awareness around the possibility of another pandemic may linger in people's minds. While the odds that anyone will continue to avoid eating in a restaurant because of that risk seem low, it's possible that fear may remain around the largest and densest kinds of social gatherings (such as public transit or air travel).</span></p><p><span>There's also the matter of sunk costs, which are probably the least intuitive and least discussed of the three concepts. Essentially, the pandemic has forced consumers and firms to incur costs they otherwise would not have; for instance, purchasing home office equipment to facilitate remote working. Once the pandemic is over, the impetus for the purchase decision will have disappeared, but people will still have the home office equipment, so working from home will continue to be marginally more attractive.</span></p><p><span>Sunk costs can also come in other, nonmonetary forms, like time. Consider that the surge in working from home has required extensive time on the part of managers, as they've needed to craft work-from-home capabilities, such as drawing up policies and learning the best ways to communicate with remote workers. This may not have been considered a valuable use of their time before the pandemic, but now that firms have been forced to incur this cost, the issue is no longer relevant, and the necessary work-from-home systems are in place.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, consumers also have limited amounts of time. When people turned to shopping online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores because of social distancing, previously reluctant consumers acclimated themselves to e-commerce out of necessity. Now that they've gotten more comfortable with shopping online, they might continue to do so out of convenience long after the pandemic.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">How Do Extreme Shocks Drive Long-Term Economic Behaviour?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>To better understand how the world might look different after COVID-19, we used these three concepts in our analysis of the five analogous historical episodes that had a significant short-term impact on consumer behaviour.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below maps out the degree to which each of these episodes led to fundamental long-term changes in economic behaviour, based on these three means.</span></p></div>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%201.PNG" alt="Five Case Studies" width="1141" height="539"></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>Altogether, our analysis of these historical episodes indicates that there's, at best, modest support for the idea that COVID-19 will affect long-term consumer habits.</span><p><span>Each of these shocks had some impact on short-term consumer behaviour, but more often than not, habits eventually reverted to more closely resemble previous behaviours and fear subsided sooner or later. Though each episode was unique, we note that sunk costs were the means through which a longer-term impact most frequently occurred.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">The Economic Impact of Food Rationing During World War II</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Residents of the United Kingdom were subject to rationing of some combination of petrol, meat, fish, cheese, and more between 1939 and 1954. The island nation imports approximately 70% of its food and was therefore exposed to massive supply-chain disruption as a result of World War II. The rationing continued after the war as the U.K. redistributed food and resources to war-devastated countries under British control.</span></p><p><span>Did this period of deprivation have a lasting impact on consumer behaviour? The fact that it lasted for so long makes the possibility of permanent change seem more likely.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows the sharp negative impact that rationing had on the demand for key food items. At their respective troughs, per capita meat consumption declined as much as 32%, fat (butter, margarine, and others) 21%, sugar 35%, and eggs 64%.</span></p></span></p>
<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span><img src="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Avenues%20for%20change%208%202.PNG" alt="U.K. Rationing" width="1142" height="741"></span></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775=""><span><span>However, Britons clearly didn't get accustomed to these austere eating habits. Food consumption rebounded in the early 1950s as rationing was relaxed, and by the mid-1950s, consumption of meat, fat, sugar, and eggs was far in excess of prewar levels.</span><p><span>Therefore, wartime rationing didn't have a noticeable long-term economic impact; in general, our analysis shows that demand for rationed goods fully recovered after the war.</span></p><p><strong><span data-v-76f3ace6="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-4387a7d2="">Did World War II Advance the Rise of Women in the Workforce?</span></strong><br data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16=""><span>Also during World War II, the number of men off at war and wartime production needs led to a spike in the number of women working outside the home. These catalysts didn't last—the men came home, and those elevated wartime production levels died down—but did this episode play a role in the continued rise of women in the workforce?</span></p><p><span>Habit may have played a role in this shift as both women and their families became more accustomed to their working. Sunk costs also had some importance as firms needed to experiment with employing more women—and, by all accounts, this experiment was successful in terms of productivity.</span></p><p><span>But overall, we believe the movement toward greater female labor force participation during the war had only a modest impact on the long-term trend. The fact is that female labor participation in the U.S. was already on the rise, and the 1940s hardly stand out in terms of the trend's longer-term adoption.</span></p><p><span>The exhibit below shows that the increase during the 1940s tracks with that of other decades—about 6 percentage points, right in line with the average decade from 1930 to 1990.</span></p></span></p>

<p data-v-4387a7d2="" data-v-03c6dd16="" data-v-7ba8d775="">One could argue that the fast growth in the decades after the 1940s was jump-started by the war, but we think other factors were more important. For instance, economists have proposed the importance of:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"I don't think that this could ever create something that I wouldn't mute" </p><p><em>- Voxel, laying down the hard truths about music generation in general and my music generator in specific</em></p></blockquote><p>In groovelet32.exe, I’d like for the art assets to be capable of wiggling and booping in time with the music. </p><p>That’s seemingly simple sounding, but that simple idea contains, uh, <em>multitudes</em>.</p><p>This can be accomplished in one of a few different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe the music whole into the execution environment and play the music with locally available music generation tools (Tone.js in JavaScript, Helm or wwise in Unity) </p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe important moments in written music into software language, have instrument hits trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, use automated analysis (Koreographer in Unity) to guess when dynamics are occcuring in the music and use those to trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using midi engine to drive effects. </p></li><li><p>Generate music entirely in place, have instrument hits directly trigger effects.</p></li></ol><p>Each strategy has its ups and downs. Notably, the first four strategies start with the simple-sounding but imposing “buy, commission, or write music”. Buying music - well, it’s hard to build a whole game around stock music - especially if music is as fundamental to the experience as it should be in a game about musical robots. </p><p>Commissioning music is simply too expensive, if I’m planning on paying my composer fairly (which I would be, if I had any money).</p><p>Writing music on my own would imply a strong upgrade in my own personal music production skills, because currently I’m operating at somewhere near the “Three Blind Mice” level. A number of my family members are talented musically - my younger brother married into a “music teacher” family - but I don’t think any of them have ever cracked open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, and they’re pretty busy with their own lives, so that’s a hard tree to shake and expect that video-game ready tunes will fall out.</p><p>So that leaves me with <strong>procedurally generated music</strong>. It’s perhaps naive to think that I, a person who can’t even write a regular song, could build a computer that could write music for me, but hey - if I’m good at anything¹ , it’s programming.</p><h2>A Basic Architecture for Procgen Music</h2><p>Some time back, I watched this inspiring JSConf talk: </p><p id="youtube2-_0ij8vY2gzE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_0ij8vY2gzE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0ij8vY2gzE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><em>so cool</em></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> “we built a tool called <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce">Magenta.js</a> that allows you to tensorflow up some tunes”</p><p>I like tensorflow! I like tunes!</p><p>Setting upon the task with some zeal I managed to get Magenta.js generating tunes, slowly. I had a simple plan for how I would take slowly-generated 8-second tunes and convert them into longer songs:</p><ol><li><p>Have a background server process generate 8-second three-part-tune clips</p></li><li><p>Use some basic heuristics to guess at the key signature (“C# major”) of the clips, evaluate their intensity (lots of drum hits? loads of notes?) and save them in a huge clip database.</p></li><li><p>Create a search interface for the clip database.</p></li><li><p>Have the client request clips from the server in a specific key and intensity.</p></li><li><p>Weave two or three clips together, repeating them a couple of times, to make a full “song”.</p></li><li><p>Add tools to control the requested key signature, intensity, and change instrument, tempo, and what-have-you at the last second.</p></li><li><p>Take the output and make it sound like real human music that people would listen to on purpose.</p></li></ol><p>Now, there are some definite problems with this scheme. One of them is <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> - an unbelievably powerful synth workbench written for people who have read<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/"> the entire book on Digital Signal Processing</a>, and <em>no other people</em>.</p><p>I actually took and passed a senior-level course in DSP for music generation, some 12 years ago. I have less of an excuse than the average person to be absolutely garbage at attaching oscillators to things. I’m still garbage, mind you, I just have less of an excuse.</p><p>Anyways, after some serious effort, I got steps 1-6 working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Look at that! Sliders! Tempo! Intensity! Configurable per-channel instruments and levels! </p><div><p>Here’s the first song that ever sounded remotely passable, produced by the system.</p><p>It’s… <em>okay</em>, right? Not <em>bad</em>. That’s where the system was a year ago.</p></div><p>Here’s another song from just a few days ago: </p><div><p>Admittedly, I haven’t been working on the procgen engine for that entire year, but it hasn’t evolved much in the interim, huh?</p><p>I figured I might be able to shape the musicality of the output with simple heuristic rules and adjustments and embellishments, but - I can’t. An extremely talented musician/producer might be able to, but as we’ve established, I’m worse at finding C than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCr91EwGGxk">the salty pirates of landlocked Saskatchewan</a>. </p></div><p>Most of my clever changes would make the output sound better… some of the time. And worse, some of the time. Sometimes, rarely, the system produces something that, if you weren’t paying a terrible lot of attention, you might confuse for real music. A lot of the time it produces something bland and amusical. About as often it produces something <em>actively unpleasant</em>.</p><p>One idea I’ve had is building an underlying voting system to try to clear “bad” tunes out of the system - if my music generation system is actually powered by a thousand clips that sound pretty good under most any circumstances because all of the ones that sound bad have been downvoted out of existence, well, that’s one way of doing things.</p><p>But even at it’s best, the output isn’t… terribly good. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>And a big part of the problem is just that composing music is <em>hard</em>.

There are dozens of conflicting sets of rules, and because there are so many ways to break those rules and still have music come out sounding good (or follow the rules and still have music come out sounding bad) a lot of music theory isn’t so much “helpful guidelines” as it is “endless taxonomy”, and most of that taxonomy has been compiled over the last 500 years by mostly Germans and Italians.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>I am literally more afraid of music theory than digital signal processing.</em></p><h2>The Many Flaws of Procedural Generation</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:331,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41426,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I love this book.

              </a><p>

            
            I wonder why Java was so respected and JS was not? Why/how was Java already seen as such a stable and mature language? </p><p>   Not just Java, other languages (like python) were also released around/near 95, and also seemed to get to "mature" respect status. much quicker.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I bring all this up because my impression of Java in 98 was that it had been around "forever" (as had C++ first developed in 79, but not standardized until 98!), but that's not. true at all. These were all new languages around the same time.
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            I'm sure the language designs had different merits, and the target applications meant a different perception and reception, but... </p><p>   it sure seems like the industry (and academics) just decided Java and C++ were the stable mature ones and langs like JS were toys.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>

              </a><p>

            
            BTW, before you assume JS was nascent/immature b/c the web wasn't much of a thing yet, remember that JS was actually released as LiveScript on the server before it was released in a browser. So "server-side JS" was always part of the story, not just Node 15 years later in 2009.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>
	      <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1335216358091579392" target="_blank">
              
              </a><p>

            
            Why didn't "we" push JS on the server the way Java and C++ were pushed in that space? </p><p>   Why wouldn't a university consider teaching JS alongside Java and C++ (and python), given they were all roughly the same age?
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>
	      <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1335216359156969473" target="_blank">
              
              </a><p>

            
            My point is, technologies and ideas don't always win on merits the way we hope/claim. More often than we admit, we just pick winners based on less tangible things like marketing.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>
	      <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1335216360473980933" target="_blank">
              
              </a><p>

            
            There's a lot of tech (frameworks, tools, etc) floating around that are just as mature/stable/useful as the hyped bandwagon stuff, just without the huge community, fancy logos, conferences, and big corporate backers. </p><p>   They're the "Java" and "C++" of today. They've been chosen.
            

            

            </p></div>

            





            <div>
	      <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1335216362407473153" target="_blank">
              
              </a><p>

            
            Through a variety of intentional and accidental effects (like marketing), they're the "winners" right now.  </p><p>   But a lot of equally worthy candidates are floating around waiting for their moment (which may or may not ever come).
            

            

            </p></div>

              </a><p>

            
            Are there any "toys" (tech that's not respected) right now that might accidentally end up ruling the world 25 years from now? What would you place your long-future bets on?

                     Some people really benefit from hearing advice that everyone knows, for the same reason we keep schools open despite every subject in them having been taught before.</p><p>In that spirit, here's some quick Things Many People Find Too Obvious To Have Told You Already.


            

            
            
            
            

            </p><p>
              Your idea is not valuable, at all. All value is in the execution. You think you are an exception; you are not. You should not insist on an NDA to talk about it; nobody serious will engage in contract review over an idea, and this will mark you as clueless.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              Technologists tend to severely underestimate the difficulty and expense of creating software, especially at companies which do not have fully staffed industry leading engineering teams ("because software is so easy there, amirite guys?")</p><p>Charge more. Charge more still. Go on.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              The press is a lossy and biased compression of events in the actual world, and is singularly consumed with its own rituals, status games, and incentives. The news necessarily fails to capture almost everything which happened yesterday. What it says is important usually isn't.
              
              

            


            

            </p><p>
              Companies find it incredibly hard to reliably staff positions with hard-working generalists who operate autonomously and have high risk tolerances. This is not the modal employee, including at places which are justifiably proud of the skill/diligence/etc of their employees.

Its no secret you will find many articles on the web proclaiming how good Golang is, and its always been something I wanted to try out.</p><p>Until now I haven’t really had a use case and I feel its always much better to have a “need” to use something to really evaluate it, or your stuck just running through hello world’s and tutorials where your doing little more than copy/pasting working code.</p><p>The project in question is almost ready for a big reveal, but for the purposes of this article lets just say I needed a binary I could distribute without the surrounding architecture needing a runtime to run the application.</p><p>So that ruled out my two go to languages, PHP and NodeJs/Javascript. And lead me down the Golang or Rust path.</p><p>I will concede I actually attempted to use Rust first. There seems to be even more hype around Rust at present and watching all the conferences around Rust and WebAssembly that are popping up on YouTube I took a stab. As this is a Golang article I won’t delve too deep into Rust, lets just say after half a day I quickly realised if I wanted to get a proof of concept out quickly for this new project Rust was not the language I should be learning on the job for. This is by far not a knock at Rust. It looks really promising, it is probably just a little too far out of my comfort level right now.</p><p>So having wasted a half a day I picked up the Golang handbook and started a project.</p><p>I had run all the samples you can find in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">tour guide</a> multiple times in the past so the core concepts like operators, values, structs etc I had an understanding of already. Packages on the other hand caused me some confusion early on which I’ll delve into further down this article.</p><h2>The Proof Of Concept</h2><p>Building the POC I dumped all my code in the <code>main</code> package. At this point the code was pretty ropey. But it did confirm for me the approach was going to work. I felt pretty at home with writing at least basic code, the syntax is very similar to PHP and javascript. Well to be more specific strongly typed PHP8.0 and Typescript.</p><p>I was getting on quite well with the language and now wanted to refactor the work into something I would be happy to commit to version control.</p><h2>Folder Structure</h2><p>This still irks me a little, it’s almost hard coded into my brain. Code goes into a <code>src</code> folder and is organised by logical groupings. At least this is how I work and is the accepted structure for the languages I use day to day.</p><p>Golang on the other hand has a different recommended structure. Its not a requirement but is recommended so I went with it. Full details can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout">https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout</a></p><p>Im sure there must be a reason that’s inherent in the language or devised by some people smarter than me that makes this a better structure, but at this point I just don’t like it. It may become clearer the more I use Golang but I just feel the separation detaches the domain relationships and functionality. I don’t see why private code should be in a wholly different location when Golang has public exports inherent in the language.</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>This is where I hit my first real hurdle, maybe I didn’t read the docs well enough, or maybe it was just me. But I had a good few hours of frustration with my IDE (Intellij IDEA) shouting at me because it couldn’t find my code. At least part of the problem was my choice to just dump everything in <code>main.go</code>, then migrating to a directory type project, and finally landing on a module structure. I also think I may of been led down a few garden paths reading up on outdated articles.</p><p>I managed to figure it out eventually and it is pretty obvious with hindsight. I haven’t yet been in a position to write a module that’s meant to be consumed externally so i’m cautious of being too critical here. But from my relatively short experience I don’t understand why you can’t use relative imports in internal code?</p><p>The fact only its name is known by a package, but it needs to explicitly define the whole module path to pickup other packages feels a little off to me:</p><div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;go&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-go&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:false,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;showPanel&quot;:false,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Go&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;go&quot;}">package foobar
  
import (
	"github.com/xxx/xxx/internal/bazzer" // why not just "../bazzer"?
)</pre></div><h2>Dependency Loops</h2><p>Im not sure how common this is, but I had a real hard time when refactoring due to cyclic dependencies on structs. Again mainly my fault and bad design in my proof of concept. If I had started with modules up front I don’t think I would of had this issue. But the good thing that came of this is my understanding of Golang interfaces.</p><p>What I really like about them is their implicit rather than explicit nature (duck typing). When I found out about this it all became clear what I needed to do to resolve my problems.</p><h2>err != nil</h2><p>I don’t think a Golang article is complete without the mention of <code>err != nil</code>. Even before I started I knew about this. I have seen various articles propose how to write better code to prevent the repetition. Something I did pickup along the way was the use of <code>defer</code> which is a pretty neat feature allowing you to something similar to <code>try{}finally</code>. But I would be lying if I didn’t say I would be immensely grateful to see <code>try{}catch</code> make an appearance in Golang.</p><h2>Releasing</h2><p>Building the project was always super simple. I then needed to figure out how I could distribute this for different architecture. By the time I got here I was feeling pretty confident with what I had achieved, my confidence lead me to starting to reinventing a process already handled exceptionally by the <a href="https://goreleaser.com/">Goreleaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader">Godownloader</a> projects. These two projects make it super simple to provide access to built copies of your app.</p><p>Which made it very surprising Godownloader seems to be struggling: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161">https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161</a></p><p>To me these two packages feel like the composer and npm of the PHP and Javascript world i’m used to.</p><p>They appear to be a critical part of the ecosystem and certainly helped me get to a usable system very quickly.</p><p>In short a simple generated yml file and some CI scripts and I had automated releases available to the project without much customisation required.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are definitely some things i’m not used to or fully understand. But i’m still very interested and very happy with what i’ve able to achieve pretty quickly. It has a familiar syntax which no doubt helps and I can’t believe i’ve got to the conclusion without mentioning its SUPER fast. I’ll be talking more about the specific project this was about when its ready for launch. The source code will be open source, so please don’t judge it too harshly. It will be my first Golang project, hopefully one of many.</p><h4>Want to know when I have new content? Enter your email address to be notified when it’s available.</h4></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p>I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think.  The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.
</p>

<h2>Thought Provokers</h2>

<p>Ramblings that make you think about the way you design.  Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In premodern India,</strong> debates were entertainment in courtly settings, a sport for profiteers and clever men who enjoyed a quick turn of phrase or put-down. Successful debaters gained followers, fame, even wealth. Those pragmatic aims intertwined with nobler ones: religious believers and nonbelievers debated over deep religious truths. Both inside and outside religious traditions, participants sparred over controversies with significant social implications. Even the efficacy of medical cures was hard-fought in the debate arena.</p>
<p>During the 9th to 10th century CE, VÄ�caspati MiÅ›ra, an Indian philosopher who was part of a Hindu tradition called â€˜NyÄ�yaâ€™ (or â€˜reasonâ€™) argued that debate benefits society when it aims for truth. He thought, too, that debate helps us humans achieve ultimate happiness in our short, fragile and often painful human lives. But if debate has such noble aims, should we care about winning or losing? And if debate leads us to the truth, should we always debate everyone, everywhere? To understand VÄ�caspatiâ€™s answer, we must first understand the NyÄ�ya philosophy of debate.</p>
<p>For NyÄ�ya philosophers, we acquire ultimate happiness by ending the selfâ€™s painful cycle of rebirth, its journey from life to life, always bound to our past actions. Before we can end this cycle, we must rid ourselves of ethical vices. And this requires knowing the truth. This is why, for NyÄ�ya thinkers, a certain kind of debate is important, as it helps us learn the truth. This truth-seeking debate is called â€˜discussionâ€™ (<em>vÄ�da</em>). This required putting forward your own thesis and criticising a contrary thesis through a specific type of inference designed to convince your opponent of the truth. Discussion was hardcore, technical stuff. Still, NyÄ�ya discussion for truth doesnâ€™t use obtuse language. Its goal isnâ€™t rhetorical trickery but making someone know something. If the components of inference are in place, and the thesis presented is true, then your conversation partner would actually come to know the truth. But to work, that inference must have certain necessary components, put together in a particular form.</p>
<p>One component part of NyÄ�ya inference is a reason that both parties agree with. Itâ€™s a fallacy to use controversial or unproven reasons â€“ a fallacy which, if youâ€™re caught out on it, would disqualify you in a debate. VÄ�caspati discusses the example of an argument about the nature of sound based on it not having certain characteristics. But the problem is when the interlocutors donâ€™t agree on whether those characteristics are decisive â€“ just as light can be a wave or a particle, thereâ€™s an open enquiry about what to conclude from the observation. Until the controversy is settled, NyÄ�ya philosophers reject any argument about sound based on these particular features. So when those engaged in a discussion have opposing views, they are to put forward their best evidence in a convincing way. Even while challenging each other, they draw each other in. Bridge-building is, in some sense, built into discussion for the truth.</p>
<p>And agreement wasnâ€™t always easy to come by for Indian thinkers. There was intense disagreement over religious texts foundational for much of societyâ€™s structure, the Vedas. For example, Buddhists rejected these texts and â€“ depending on which scholars you believe â€“ much of the societal structure that came with them. They also interpret ordinary experience differently than NyÄ�ya philosophers. Think thereâ€™s a coffee cup over there? For some Buddhists, that cup is not a cup but a construction of your mind. For others, itâ€™s merely a cluster of atomic bits you call a â€˜cupâ€™. Think you have a self? Not so fast, says the self-denying Buddhist.</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another</p>
<p>And yet, despite the chasm between them, we have evidence that Buddhists and NyÄ�ya philosophers debated, in person and through generations of written conversation. So are NyÄ�ya philosophers premodern free-speech absolutists, for whom the desire for unbridled debate is above all else? Is debate for them an almost salvific activity, to be entered into with all comers, at all times? Would they, for instance, agree with the signatories of a recent letter to <em>Harperâ€™s</em> who argue that restricting debate â€˜invariably hurts those who lack powerâ€™ and that the â€˜way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them awayâ€™?</p>
<p><strong>For VÄ�caspati and other</strong> NyÄ�ya philosophers, debate works only under certain conditions. It wonâ€™t always, everywhere, for everyone, result in a turn towards truth. In the background to NyÄ�ya thinking about debate are older texts, such as <em>Carakaâ€™s Compendium</em>, which urges medical experts to consider their own rhetorical and intellectual abilities, the hostility or friendliness of the audience, and the abilities of their interlocutor, before agreeing to a debate. VÄ�caspati adds additional dimensions to this calculus: the ethical stakes and the moral qualities of oneâ€™s conversation partner. And he draws the lines for our dialectic practices by distinguishing between three kinds of debate: discussion (<em>vÄ�da</em>), disputation (<em>jalpa</em>) and wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>). VÄ�caspati used these categories to work out how debateâ€™s practical aims (victory, material gain) are related to its epistemic ones (convincing, truth-seeking).</p>
<p>Discussion involves two truth-seekers coming together to learn from one another. For instance, students and teachers engage in discussion. But sometimes debate participants are focused only on winning, are prideful about their supposed â€˜knowledgeâ€™, arenâ€™t responsive to facts, and are looking for money or fame. VÄ�caspati points out that sometimes debate occurs between such less-than-honest interlocutors in front of powerful people who hold sway over large populations. In India, this was the royal court, where the winner might influence the establishment of a religion by decree. Today, this could include the court of social media, where powerful, Tweet-happy politicians influence society with a click of a mouse.</p>
<p>In his context, VÄ�caspati allows you to stoop to an apparently lower standard of rationality: faced with a powerful person spouting dangerous falsehoods and misleading people who depend on them, you might use fallacies to â€˜refuteâ€™ them. This is the second kind of debate, known as disputation (<em>jalpa</em>). In disputation, whether your argument is genuinely good matters less than its ability to convince the watching judges or crowd. Twist your opponentâ€™s words, read them literally instead of metaphorically, engage in bad reasoning â€“ itâ€™s all fair game in a disputation. Of course, returning fallacy for falsehood might not be a robust way of undermining a lie, but it could convince an easily swayed audience.</p>
<p>Should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic?</p>
<p>You could even engage in a third form of debate, wrangling (<em>vitaá¹‡á¸�Ä�</em>) â€“ putting forward no position, but leaving that aside for the sake of merely knocking down a dangerous person. Wrangling is often condemned as a performative contradiction: one canâ€™t truly lack a position when arguing against someone else. Why would you criticise someoneâ€™s view if you didnâ€™t think the opposite, or something close, were true? Imagine arguing against a flat-Earther, painstakingly showing their fallacious use of science and their cherrypicking of evidence. When they ask: â€˜And what do you think?â€™, you shrug. Youâ€™re just playing devilâ€™s advocate. NyÄ�ya thinkers find this attitude, which they identify in some Buddhists, dubious. A wrangler is a kind of sceptic lacking any intellectual core. Today we might think of trolls, the kind found in the darker corners of the internet, meme-generators who seem to lack any position of their own, having only glee in attacking others.</p>
<p>Taking up either strategy, disputation or wrangling, is risky and could backfire. If a judge identifies your fallacies, you lose the debate. Worse yet, your audience will conclude that your opponent is right. In VÄ�caspatiâ€™s view, when high-stakes debates occur over moral issues, if an audience is swayed, this could damage the correct order of things in a profound way. So when should a truth-seeker engage in debate with an opponent who holds opposing views, views they find morally reprehensible and potentially dangerous? Academics face this situation now and again: should a virologist agree to a debate with a vaccine sceptic? What if that debate were to be held at a local middle school, where the audience is young students without the relevant education to identify bad science? For VÄ�caspati, the answer is that our debate practices depend on our circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>In considering what</strong> to do, VÄ�caspati considers the ethical views of his opponents, worrying about the â€˜collapse of righteousnessâ€™ (<em>dharma-viplava</em>) in the situation where a malicious debater argues in front of powerful people. Yet he doesnâ€™t draw hard-and-fast lines about whom to debate based just on their views. Those people who seem to have no position of their own? Theyâ€™re welcome to join into discussion of the truth, if theyâ€™re genuinely interested in learning. And those people whose views challenge your religious perspective? NyÄ�ya philosophers famously oppose Buddhists who donâ€™t just disagree about abstract metaphysical ideas, but who challenge the religious orthodoxy of the day. And yet, over time, NyÄ�ya thinkers engage with, and even learn from, their opponents.</p>
<p>VÄ�caspati doesnâ€™t offer a flowchart about whom to debate and when. But in prioritising debate for truth, this NyÄ�ya philosopher encourages rational discussion that finds common ground even in intense disagreement. When a conversation partner ceases to participate in the joint project of truth-seeking, playing by different rules, losing any sensitivity to reality, …</p></div></div></div>

<p>In my book "How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism" I point out that the claims for Big Tech powers of behavior modification powers emanate from the companies' own self-serving boasts pitched to bring in new ad-tech customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>I point to the thinness of the external research on ad-tech's efficacy, and the replication failures of its research foundations on things like "sentiment analysis," "microexpressions" and "Big 5 Personalities" – the whole panoply of digital phrenology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are undeniable, easily measured means by which Big Tech modifies our behavior that don't require us to treat marketing puffery as ground truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to talk to your friends you have to use Facebook because Mark Zuckerberg is holding them hostage with monopoly tactics
</li>
<li>
<p>Google uses monopoly rents to buy its way to search default on every platform, so the answer to every question you ask comes from Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple gets to decide which apps you're allowed to use, who can fix your devices, and when you have to throw them away and buy new ones, thanks to DRM and lavish spending to kill dozens of Right to Repair initiatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are mass-scale, persistent behavior modifications that have nothing to do with psychological manipulation and everything to do with economic chicanery.</p>
<p>This week on the Freakonomics podcast, Stephen Dubner turns an economic lens on Big Tech's ad-tech boasts.</p>
<p>He talks to Steve Tadelis, an academic economist who once headed a program at Ebay to evaluate the efficacy of ad spending. First they tried eliminating "brand" advertising (that is, advertising buys for the word "ebay") and found that there was no drop in their revenues.</p>
<p>The logic behind Ebay buying ads for "ebay" is that if they don't, their competitors will, so a search for "ebay" will bring up links to Amazon. That happened…and people scrolled right past the Amazon ads to the "organic" Ebay link below the ads.</p>
<p>But Ebay also buys a bunch of keyword ads for products, like "guitar" or "washing machine" or "picture frame." They estimated 5% of their revenue came from these ads, and that every $1 they spent on them brought in $1.50.</p>
<p>Tadelis designed another experiment and found that these ads were actually responsible for 0.5% of their revenue – an order of magnitude less than their estimate – and that every $1 they spent generated $0.60 in <em>losses</em>. They cut $100m from their ad-spending.</p>
<p>But despite publication of these findings, the world increased its ad-tech spending. Tadelis attributes this to the fact that the major players in ad-tech are all incentivized to repeat the unsubstantiated tale of ad-tech's efficacy.</p>
<p>Ad-tech companies, publishers, and ad-tech buying consultancies are all compromised and unable to objectively assess whether ads work (cue Upton Sinclair: "It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it").</p>
<p>And, of course, now Big Tech's critics have joined the ranks of those who insist that ad-tech works with spooky, devastating efficacy.</p>
<p>For evidence, all of them point to how much money the industry generates.</p>
<p>Why would people buy these products if they didn't work? Well, the obvious answer is, "That happens all the time." See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multivitamins
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge funds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's another answer: "it's a bubble."</p>
<p>A recent, excellent book on the ad-tech bubble is Tim Hwang's SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>Hwang tells Dubner that in a bubble, "the red lights are flashing but everybody in the industry just refuses to take a look at the real data."</p>
<p>Bubbles thrive on opacity and complexity. Think of the 2008 financial crisis, where the lack of transparency in "toxic assets" was compounded by their complexity, which led people – including "sophisticated" regulators and investors – to trust them.</p>
<p>They assumed that the manifest absurdity of the claims made by CDO salespeople must reflect their own ignorance. After all, all those OTHER people wouldn't spend trillions on derivatives if they weren't safe enough to buy yourself and exercise regulatory forbearance over.</p>
<p>But as Hwang points out, the ad-tech market is built on garbage. By Google's own reckoning, 60% of the ads that are charged for are never seen by any human being – literally the majority of the industry's product is a figment of feverish machine imaginations.</p>
<p>While Google's own research (and that of other Big Tech players) show that ad-tech works, independent researchers find the opposite: switching from "behavioral" (surveillance) ads to "contextual" ads only reduces clickthrough by 5%.</p>
<p>Behavioral ad clickthroughs are 0.01-0.03%, and much of that is bot activity.</p>
<p>The industry is opaque and incestuous. Ad agencies – nominally working for advertisers – get massive kickbacks from ad-tech platforms for bringing them business.</p>
<p>Proctor and Gamble – the company that invented the concept of brand ads – tried taking $200m out of its online ad spend and saw <em>zero</em> change in sales.</p>
<p>And yet, ad-tech spending continues to rise.</p>
<p>Hwang says we need a "punk rock" National Bureau of Economic Research, an org that will neutrally measure ad-tech performance and slowly deflate the bubble rather than bursting it, because an ad-tech collapse would kill ad-supported media.</p>
<p>All this is kind of a microcosm for the problems of economics in general. For decades, economics was dominated by the neoclassical idea of "homo economicus," a rational utility maximizer whose bad choices were good, actually.</p>
<p>(That's still the cartoon that undergrads get)</p>
<p>Advertising – especially brand ads – is grounded in the idea that irrationality is universal and exploitable, that you can trick people into paying a 50,000% markup by slapping a logo on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>But advertisers – and the industry – assume <em>they</em> are immune to irrationality, that they don't need to worry that they themselves will be suckered by slick sales-patter from ad tech, or their agencies.</p>

<p>Last week, the largest organized strike in human history shut down India. 250,000,000 people struck against Indian PM Narendra Modi's neoliberal reforms to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms">https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms</a></p>
<p>These reforms don't just remove the collective bargaining and price controls that protect the ag sector (which employs more than half the Indian working population), but also stripped multinational corporations and government of liability for harms to their workers.</p>
<p>All this while unemployment is at 27%, and 76% of rural Indians lack the funds to cover their basic nutritional needs. Meanwhile Indian billionaires have increased their wealth by 35% during the pandemic. India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has made $12m per <em>hour</em> since March.</p>
<p>The strike didn't just turn out unemployed people and farmers: the turnout was driven by acts of solidarity from ever sector of society.</p>
<p>In his discussion with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now, P Sainath offers some really important political context.</p>
<p>Modi has had a comfortable Congressional majority for two years and has three years left to go in his mandate, so why did he wait for the pandemic to make this far-reaching power-grab?</p>
<p>Sainath: "The reasoning was, these blokes are on their knees now. They can’t organize. They can’t hit back. And in fact, many leading neoliberal intellectuals, economists and journalists, editors, incited the government, saying, 'Never waste a good crisis.'"</p>
<p>It's shock doctrine shit, in other words. But Modi badly misjudged the moment: rather than being beating beyond resistance, Indians have been beaten to the sticking point, and will no longer be fooled by religious bigotry and neoliberal fairy tales.</p>
<p>Right wing movements around the world are grounded in the idea that some people are born to rule and the rest of us are born to be ruled over. Antimajoritarian philosophy isn't compatible with democracy, because it requires sustained turkeys-voting-for-Christmas to survive.</p>
<p>As India shows, the traditional tools of antimajoritarianism – xenophobia, sectarianism, armed violence – are unstable in the long run. Eventually there comes a point when you can't just shout "Muslims are scary!" at starving people and expect them to take that for an answer.</p>
<p>Indians have been slaughtered by both covid and mismanagement. They are at the breaking point. They are rising up.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started to clone DEC's PDP workhorse minicomputers, especially the PDP-8, which was replicated in the USSR as the Saratov-2. Today, the Saratov-2 is a distant memory, with not even a single high-quality photo of the system online.</p>
<p>Until now. Russian urban explorer Ralph Mirebs's photos of a "Soviet Computing Cemetery" (location undisclosed) that features the rotting remains of a Saratov-2 amid the ashes and fire-suppresant residue of a long-ago data-center blaze.</p>

<p>The Saratov-2 was wild: it didn't have a microprocessor; rather, it was broken down into components, each in its own drawer: a 12-bit computing unit, I/O, RAM (ferromagnetic cubes).</p>
<p>Also present in the cemetery: an Electronics 100/25 – the Soviet version of the PDP-11 – and some DVK-2Ms (early personal computers).</p>
<p>The author recalls their own computer science education in 1993, when "one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network."</p>

			<p>From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.  My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore.  His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.</p>

<p>I recognized that he had a tendency towards <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">self-aggrandizement</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">awkward flattery of his readers</a>, but at worst he seemed harmless.  As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn’t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.</p>

<p>Recently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore.  He’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html">written</a> about the need to defend “moderates” from bullies on the “extreme left”, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1334441961147822081">asserted</a> that “the truth is to the right of the median” because “the left is culturally dominant,” and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjGX2-bU4AAWkUX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">justified</a> Coinbase’s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed “political” by saying that it “will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.”</p>

<p>I went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something.  It turned out that I had.  There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design.  In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In April 2001, six years after the release of the Java language, Paul Graham weighed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html">I’ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won’t be a very successful language.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He followed up with a number of observations about Java, such as the fact that it was designed by committee, infantilizes its users, and owed its initial success to an ailing corporate sponsor.  But, he wrote, this wasn’t an analysis of Java so much as introspection on his own “hacker’s radar”.  This radar was the aesthetic response of an expert programmer, drawn from epiphenomena surrounding the language and the opinions of other experts in his social circle.</p>

<p>A month later, in an essay on why languages are popular, he doubled down on the importance of his personal intuition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Programming languages are <em>for</em> hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of a language can only be judged by experts (“a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software”), and adoption by those experts will drive adoption by everyone else.  Ultimately, “a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.”</p>

<p>The context for both essays was that Graham was creating his own language, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>.  He wanted it to be popular, and was working out how to make that happen.</p>

<p>The first intrinsic driver of popularity he named was “brevity”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he’ll have to type.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called back to this when discussing the importance of libraries, which can reduce any program to a single invocation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Graham was referring to Perl’s core library functions, not the much larger set of library functions that were even then available via <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, because he placed this responsibility wholly upon the shoulders of the language designer, saying language design would become increasingly focused on “how to design great libraries.”</p>

<p>Graham named other drivers of popularity in this essay, but he returned to brevity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html">again</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">again</a> over the next year, culminating in an essay on the singular importance of brevity, now dubbed “succinctness”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drawing from studies that found “programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language”, he declared that “the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language”.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, did he mention libraries.  The next month, he explained that given a sufficiently succinct language, users could simply write their own libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be likely to call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a significant departure from his earlier writings.  Only a year before, he had stated that “[i]t’s hard to design good libraries. It’s not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.”  He had emphasized that library design was a key part of language design, and even a year later he would tell us “[d]esign usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.”</p>

<p>Now he argued that the language designer only need provide a barebones language of sufficient brevity, and all else would follow.  Library design can’t be both critically important and an incidental part of someone else’s six-month software project.  Despite this, Graham never mentioned libraries ever again.</p>

<p>A year later, he explained that Arc was trying to be a “hundred-year language”.  “It may seem presumptuous,” he wrote, but “[l]anguages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.”  He asserted the most important part of the language were the “fundamental operators”, because the rest of the language “could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators”.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a language ready for the 22nd century?  Certainly not any concerns about performance, since “[e]ven if [computers] only end up being a paltry million times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming languages substantially.”  Not data structures, since they’re just a premature optimization of the humble list.  Not a mechanism (or even notation) for parallel computation, since a simple description of the problem will “ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations of data.”</p>

<p>A hundred-year language <em>should</em>, however, be succinct.  First “write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.”  And of course the program you’d really like to write is the shortest one possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">[T]he algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If we had the hundred-year language now,” Graham wrote, “it would at least make a great pseudocode.”  Confusingly, he asserted that since it will need to perform well on its million-times-faster future processor, “presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware.”</p>

<p>“When you see these ideas laid out like that,” he wrote, “it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>Four years later, in 2008, Arc was released.  It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace">Lisp-1</a> with shorter names and fewer parentheses than most other Lisps, and some reader macros to make anonymous functions easier to define.  All primitives were defined in terms of MzScheme, a different Lisp, which provided the compiler and other tooling.  It also came with a barebones web framework which used continuations, reminiscent of the Smalltalk-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)">Seaside framework</a> which had been around since 2002.</p>

<p>It was, in all, underwhelming.  There were many paths that could have led Graham to his professed goals, and he took none of them.</p>

<p>He had written that strings were premature optimization, and should be replaced by lists of characters.  If he had done so, and made the characters full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point">Unicode code points</a>, Arc could have been one of the few languages not suffering from a half-century hangover stretching all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.  Instead, the initial release used byte strings which only supported the ASCII character set.</p>

<p>Graham had asked “[h]ow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.”  But the undeniably succinct primitives and composition rules of array programming languages were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Server-based deployment of software was a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">central theme</a> in Graham’s essays, and his continuation-based web framework was an interesting and fairly novel way to create continuity across multiple requests in a single session.  But since each link on the page was a continuation, and each continuation was stored in-memory in a single process, this created a single, memory-hungry point of failure.  For years, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> would simply display “unknown or expired link” if you waited too long to click a link.  If Arc had its own runtime, it could have supported …</p></article></div></div></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

			<h3>Balenciaga created a video game for their Fall/Winter 2021 presentation</h3> 
			<h4>Well, it's not a real video game more like a simulation... But anyway, it's cool!</h4>
			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-videogame.gif" alt="balenciaga video game"></p><p>Due to covid-19 being in full swing the big brands had to think long and hard about what exactly they should do for their collection presentations. Here are the highlights: </p>
			<p>• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCQxPSNzU2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada did a “livestream”</a> of their fashion show which ended with a Q&amp;A with Rick Owens and Miuccia Prada. Prada’s show didn’t look like a real livestream at all, more like a high production recording that took a whole day to film. We don’t mind though, no point having a “live” livestream really. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747647002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burberry cleverly partnered with Twitch</a> for their livestream.<br>
			• Jacquemus had a socially distanced show in a wheat field and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vTYQWNFgTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestreamed</a> it.<br>
			• Gucci hosted their own fashion week called “<a href="https://www.guccifest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GucciFest</a>” collaborating with Gus Van Sant on their 7 part video series. Our attention span didn’t make it past the first episode unfortunately. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.chanel.com/fr/mode/collection/metiers-art-2020-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chanel had their show in a castle</a> and they only had one guest watching the show: Kristen Stewart. Weeeeeeiiiird. We hope she tested negative...<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh7ab7-Gf_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celine</a> hired out an empty football stadium in Monaco where Hedi Slimane showed his Gen-Z-friendly collection.<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cmolbk0EWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acne Studios</a> did a neat livestream at the empty Grand Palais.<br>
			• Balenciaga on the other hand went all in and created an <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online videogame</a> dedicated to their new collection - it’s something we would only expect from Demna Gvasalia. <br></p>

			<p>The game is called <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow</i></a> and it’s a simulation taking you through a digital world that Balenciaga created where the characters are wearing the brand’s Fall/Winter 2021 collection. The entire simulation [we call it a simulation and not a game since you are just walking a pathway instead of playing] takes place for around 15 minutes. It starts with an intro where you roll through the “characters” like in a 90s fighting game detailing the garments in each look [check out the animated GIF above].</p>

			<p>You then transition into a Blade Runner-esque world based in a concrete building perhaps in a big metropolitan city, where the models are showcasing the new collection while standing around, browsing on their phones or taking selfies. </p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-01.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-02.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-03.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>You then walk through 5 zones, all zones looking apocalyptic. See this “Bringing life back to earth” ad in their game below, indicating a scary future.</p>

			<p><img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-04.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-05.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>

			<img src="https://fashionweb.io/img/05-balenciaga-ss21-06.jpg" alt="balenciaga video game still"></p><p>There is a small story in the game and it’s very very much fitting for Balenciaga’s brand and current creative direction. <span>*SPOILER ALERT, highlight to read*</span> <span>We thought the story would end when we arrive to a rave in the forest, but we continued from there, bypassing models dancing high on life </span><span>*SPOILER ALERT OVER*</span></p>
			

			<p>If this was a contest, hands down we would give Balenciaga the golden medal 🥇 for their spring/summer 2021 presentation.</p>

			


			<div>
				<h4><span>FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h4>
				<p>Phew, all these brands’ Marketing and Digital departments must have been sweating hard from all that digital thinking this year. A for effort guys! We will be watching you again in 6 months.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops">mozilla/sops</a>, but even if the readme is amazingly detailed, a from-scratch example is always nice to have.</p>

<p><code>sops</code>, in a nutshell, bridges the gap between various key management services (PGP, AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault) and you.
This post will attempt to get you on your feet as fast as possible, in 3 simple steps: from “<em>I have no idea what to do with my hands</em>” to “<em>No way it’s that easy!</em>”.</p>

<p>Install the dependencies:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>sops gnupg
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And run these 3-ish commands to convince yourself:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Clone the example repository</span>
<span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/ervinb/sops-gpg-example.git
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>sops-gpg-example

<span># Import the encryption key</span>
<span>## The path is Keybase specific and it will work on any platform - no need to use your local filesystem path</span>
<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--import</span> &lt;<span>(</span>keybase fs <span>read</span> /keybase/team/sopsgpgexample/pgp/key.asc<span>)</span>
<span>## Or if you don't have Keybase set up yet</span>
<span>$ </span>gpg <span>--import</span> &lt;<span>(</span>curl <span>-L</span> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ervinb/288c44a45cf2614a0684bea333b3aa36/raw/sops-gpg-example.asc<span>)</span>

<span># Decrypt and open the file</span>
<span>$ </span>sops secrets/mysecrets.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your day-to-day interaction with this would be only the last line.</p>

<p><code>gpg --import</code> has to be executed only once, after which the key will be part of the local keychain
(persists reboots as well).
That’s literally all there is to it, after following the below steps.</p>

<h2 id="do-it-yourself">Do it yourself</h2>

<p>Start the stopwatch - we have 2 minutes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a PGP key
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> gpg <span>--batch</span> <span>--generate-key</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>EOF</span><span>
  %no-protection
  Key-Type: default
  Subkey-Type: default
  Name-Real: Foo Bar
  Expire-Date: 0
</span><span>EOF

    <p>This is also perfect if you want more control over the secrets, like using different keys for different environments.
For example <code>secrets/*.dev.enc.yaml</code> could use one key, and <code>secrets/*.prod.enc.yaml</code> another one.

<h4 id="note-for-linux-users">Note for Linux users</h4>

<p>I’ve found that both on Fedora and Ubuntu, for whatever reason, creating a new file with <code>sops</code> throws the following cryptic error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sops secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
&lt;save the file <span>in </span>the editor&gt;
File has not changed, exiting.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The solution is to create the file first and encrypt it in-place afterwards:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>vi secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
<span>$ </span>sops <span>-i</span> <span>-e</span> secrets/new.dev.enc.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="distributing-the-key-to-firends-and-family">Distributing the key to firends and family</h2>

<p>To extract the PGP key from your local keychain, use:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gpg <span>--list-keys</span>
<span>-------------------------------</span>
pub   rsa2048 2020-12-06 <span>[</span>SC]

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>--armor</code> makes it so that the output is ASCII (<code>.asc</code>) formatted, and not in binary (default).</p>

<p>One of the most seamless ways to distribute keys and other sensitive files is Keybase.
It has a low barrier of entry, and you can control the granularity of access with “teams”.
It also integrates nicely with the filesystem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install Keybase
    
  </li>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Store the secret key under a team’s folder</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, you grab the universal path and import the key to anywhere with <code>gpg</code> installed.</p>

<h2 id="use-it-in-your-applications">Use it in your applications</h2>

<p>To use the decrypted values in your application, you can just add a line to your setup scripts
to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sops <span>-d</span> secrets/mysecret.dev.enc.yaml <span>&gt;</span> configuration.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(make sure to add the decrypted files to <code>.gitignore</code>)</p>

<p>For Terraform projects use <a href="https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops">terraform-sops</a>, and if you’re into Terragrunt,
it has a built-in <a href="https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file">sops_decrypt_file</a> function.</p>

<p>You will be running <code>sops</code> only to create or edit secrets, otherwise, it will be invisible (and incredible).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>Docker's Second Death</h3></p><h3 id="feels-like-forever">Feels Like Forever</h3><p>Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker <em>feels</em> really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew <em>of</em> containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.</p><p>The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg" alt="docker-shirt"></p><p>To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.</p><h3 id="it-was-inevitable">It Was Inevitable</h3><p>The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.</p><p>Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.</p><h3 id="docker-debt">Docker Debt</h3><p>In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png" alt="dockershim"></p><p>And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png" alt="withoutdocker"></p><p>It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:</p><pre><code>docker run
</code></pre><p>But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.</p><p>While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Before jumping to any Kubernetes specifics, let's talk about the service discovery problem in general.</p>
<h2 id="service-discovery-problem">Service discovery problem</h2>
<p>In the world of web service development, it's a common practice to run multiple copies of a service at the same time. Every such copy is a separate instance of the service represented by a network endpoint (i.e. some <em>IP</em> and <em>port</em>) exposing the service API. Traditionally, virtual or physical machines have been used to host such endpoints, with the shift towards containers in more recent times. Having multiple instances of the service running simultaneously increases its availability and helps to adjust the service capacity to meet the traffic demand. On the other hand, it also complicates the overall setup - before accessing the service, a client (the term <em>client</em> is intentionally used loosely here; oftentimes a client of some service is another service) needs to figure out the actual IP address and the port it should use. The situation becomes even more tricky if we add the ephemeral nature of instances to the equation. New instances come and existing instances go because of the non-zero failure rate, up- and downscaling, or maintenance. That's how a so-called <strong><em>service discovery</em></strong> problem arises.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/service-discovery-problem.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Service discovery problem.</i></p>
</div>


<h2 id="server-side-service-discovery">Server-side service discovery</h2>
<p>A pretty common way of solving the service discovery problem is putting a load balancer <em>aka</em> reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx or HAProxy) in front of the group of instances constituting a single service. An address (i.e. DNS name or less frequently IP) of such a load balancer is a much more stable piece of information. It can be communicated to the clients on development or configuration stages and assumed invariable during a single client lifespan. Then, from the client standpoint, accessing the multi-instance service is no different from accessing a single network endpoint. In other words, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html">the service discovery happens completely on the server-side</a>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/server-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Server-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The load balancer abstracts the volatile set of service instances away from the clients. However, the load balancer itself needs to be aware of the up to date state of the service fleet. This can be achieved by adding a <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html"><em>service registry</em></a> component. On the startup, an instance needs to be added to the registry database. Upon the termination, the instance needs to be removed from it. One of the main tasks of the load balancer is to dynamically update its routing rules based on the service registry information.</p>
<p>While it looks very appealing from the client standpoint, the server-side service discovery may quickly reveal its downsides, especially in highly-loaded environments. The load balancer component is a <strong>single point of failure and a potential throughput bottleneck</strong>. To overcome this, the load balancing layer needs to be designed with a reasonable level of redundancy. Additionally, the load balancer may <strong>need to be aware of all the communication protocols</strong> used between services and clients and there will be always an <strong>extra network hop</strong> on the request path.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-service-discovery">Client-side service discovery</h2>
<p>Can we solve the service discovery problem without introducing the centralized load balancing component? Sure! If we keep the <em>service registry</em> component around, we can teach the clients to look up the service instance addresses in the <em>service registry</em> directly. After fetching the full list of IP addresses constituting the service fleet, a client could pick up an instance based on the load balancing strategy at its disposal. In such a case, <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html">the service discovery would be happening solely on the client-side</a>. Probably the most prominent real-world implementation of the client-side service discovery is Netflix <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a> projects.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/client-side-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The benefits of the client-side approach mostly come from the absence of the load balancer. There is neither a <strong>single point of failure</strong> nor a potential <strong>throughput bottleneck</strong> in the system design. There is also one less moving part which is usually a good thing and <strong>no extra network hops on the packet path</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as with the server-side service discovery, there are some significant drawbacks as well. Client-side service discovery <strong>couples clients with the <em>service registry</em></strong>. It <strong>requires some integration code</strong> to be written for every programming language or framework in your ecosystem. And obviously, this <strong>extra logic complicates the clients</strong>. There seem to be an effort to <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/">offload the client-side service discovery logic to the service proxy sidecars</a> but that's already a different story...</p>
<h2 id="dns-and-service-discovery">DNS and service discovery</h2>
<p>Service discovery can be implemented in more than just two ways. There is a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#DNS-based_service_discovery">DNS-based service discovery (DNS-SD)</a> approach that actually even predates the massive spread of microservices. Quoting the Wikipedia, <i>"a client discovers the list of available instances for a given service type by querying the DNS PTR record of that service type's name; the server returns zero or more names of the form <code>&lt;Service&gt;.&lt;Domain&gt;</code>, each corresponding to a SRV/TXT record pair. The SRV record resolves to the domain name providing the instance..."</i> and then another DNS query can be used to resolve a chosen instance's domain name to the actual IP address. Wow, so many layers of indirection, sounds fun 🙈</p>
<p>I never worked with DNS-SD, but to me, it doesn't sound like full-fledged service discovery. Rather, DNS is used as a <em>service registry</em>, and then depending on the dislocation of the code that knows how to query and interpret DNS-SD records, we can get either a <a href="https://github.com/benschw/srv-lb">canonical client-side</a> or a <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/dns-service-discovery-haproxy/">canonical server-side</a> implementation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS">Round-robin DNS</a> can be (ab)used for service discovery. Even though it was originally designed for load balancing, or rather load distribution, having multiple A records for the same hostname (i.e. service name) returned in a rotating manner implicitly abstracts multiple replicas behind a single service name.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>DNS has a significant drawback when used for service discovery</strong>. Updating DNS records is a slow procedure. There are <strong>multiple layers of caches</strong>, including the client-side libraries, and historically record's TTL isn't strictly respected. As a result, propagating the change in the set of service instances to all the clients can take a while.</p>
<h2 id="entering-kubernetes-realm">Entering Kubernetes realm</h2>
<p>First, let's play an analogy game!</p>
<p>If I were to draw some analogies between Kubernetes and more traditional architectures, I'd compare Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/"><em>Pods</em></a> with service instances. <em>Pods</em> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/k0zc0m/kubernetes_pods_are_logical_hosts_or_simply/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">many things</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1331630336707596288?s=20">many people</a>, however, when it comes to networking <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model">the documentation clearly states that</a> <i>"...Pods can be treated much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration."</i></p>
<p>If <em>Pods</em> correspond to individual instances of a service, I'd expect a similar analogy for the <em>service</em>, as a logical grouping of instances, itself. And indeed there is a suitable concept in Kubernetes called... surprise, surprise, a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"><em>Service</em></a>. <i>"In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service)."</i></p>
<p>Strengthening the analogy, the set of Pods making up a Service should be also considered ephemeral because neither the Pods' headcount nor the final set of IP addresses is stable. Thus, in Kubernetes, the problem of providing a reliable <strong>service discovery</strong> remains actual.</p>
<p>While creating a new Service, one should choose a name that will be used to refer to the set of Pods constituting the service. Among other things, the Service maintains an up to date list of IP addresses of its Pods organized as an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-endpoints"><em>Endpoints</em></a> (or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/"><em>EndpontSlice</em></a> since Kubernetes 1.17) object. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#cloud-native-service-discovery">Citing the documentation</a> one more time, <i>"...if you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints,</i> [I guess using the Service name] <i>that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes."</i> Well, sounds like an invitation to implement a <del>cloud-native</del> Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery with the Kubernetes control plane playing (in particular) the role of the <em>service registry</em>.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/kube-native-service-discovery.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Kubernetes-native client-side service discovery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>However, the only real-world usage of this mechanism I've stumbled upon so far was in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/07/23/under-the-hood-of-linkerds-state-of-the-art-rust-proxy-linkerd2-proxy/#the-life-of-a-request"><em>service mesh</em></a> kind of software. It's a bit unfair to mention it here though because <em>service mesh</em> itself is needed to provide, in particular, the service discovery mechanism for its users. So, if you're aware of the client-side service discovery implementations leveraging Kubernetes Endpoints API please drop a comment below.</p>
<p>Luckily, as with many other things in Kubernetes, there's more than one way <del>to skin a cat</del> to get the service discovery done. And the applications that weren't born cloud-native (i.e. 99% of them) will likely find the next service-discovery mechanism much more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="network-side-service-discovery">Network-side service discovery</h2>
<p><i>Disclaimer: I've no idea if there is such thing as <em>network-side</em> service discovery in other domains and I've never seen the usage of this term in the microservices world. But I find it funny and suitable for the purpose of this paragraph.</i></p>
<p>In Kubernetes, the name of a Service object must be a valid <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names">DNS label name</a>. It's not a coincidence. When the DNS add-on is enabled (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#dns">and I guess it's almost always the case</a>), every Service gets a DNS record like <code>&lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace-name&gt;</code>. Obviously, this name can be used by applications to access the service and it simplifies the life of the clients to the highest possible extent. A single well-known address behind every Service <strong>eradicates the need for any service discovery logic on the client-side</strong>.</p>
<p>However, as we already know, DNS is often ill-suited for service discovery and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#why-not-use-round-robin-dns">the Kubernetes ecosystem is not an exception</a>. Therefore, instead of using round-robin DNS to list Pods' IP addresses, Kubernetes introduces one more IP …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="toc-how-it-works-1"><span>How It Works</span></h3><p>A Raspberry Pi computer promiscuously sniffs packets on the local network. A Python script parses these packets, looking for any communication between the smart speaker and the vendor's cloud service. When detected, an API endpoint on an Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller development board is accessed. This causes an LED attached to the Arduino to flash, thus alerting you to a speaker sending data to the vendor.</p><p>A single Raspberry Pi can trigger alerts on a number of Speaker Snitch devices all throughout your home.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img src="https://elvischidera.com/1ffaeb44c8a342b87f8aea771c98c871/dart_work_flow.svg"><p>There are currently ~2.5 billion Android devices — consisting of ~1,300 discrete brands and ~24,000 unique device models. I'm exploring tapping into this latent resource pool to make automated testing affordable &amp; unlock a more comprehensive configuration coverage.</p><p>The goal of DART (Distributed Android Remote Testing) is to enable any Android device to run automated tests — without ADB or complex setups/maintenance. A commercial product could pay people per hour of device use, allowing anyone to utilize idle device time. Each device is subsumed to provide a distributed testbed.</p><p>DART is orthogonal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing">crowdsourced testing</a> — the latter requires active human participation.</p><p>DART seems to be the best solution to utilize device idle time — the best way to verify that an app works on "Samsung S9" is by executing it on "Samsung S9".  Contrast this to other procedures where phones are usually a suboptimal option: server hosting, remote computation, etc.</p><p>In the demo below, I ran a few test cases on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Focus Privacy Browser</a> without cables/ADB.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcHEsx7ODyw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>1.1. 💪 Motivation</h3><p>The following problems motivated the development of DART.</p><h5>i. 🧩 Android Device Fragmentation</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/4c37a9cd069bcaa8ee86c04764a37790/android_fragmentation.gif" alt="Android device fragmentation"><p>The top device farms barely cover 1% of the total number of Android device models. Nondistributed device farms favor depth instead of breadth — maintenance cost increases as more diverse devices are added.</p><p>Testing on flagship devices alone doesn't always suffice.</p><blockquote><p>Anecdote: I once spent an entire day debugging an ANR that occurs to a small fraction of our users. I discovered it only affects phones purchased in specific regions. I never was able to reproduce the issue on the same phone bought in the USA.</p></blockquote><p>The Android version distribution exacerbates this problem.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><a href="https://www.headspin.io/">Headspin</a> aims to alleviate some of these issues. They claim to have a global infrastructure of more than 22,000 SIM-enabled (similar) devices in 150 locations. A big plus as traditional services (like Firebase Testlabs) can't handle geographical concerns. At Headspin's core is the <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf">DeviceFarmer STF</a> open-source library. But like its predecessors, Headspin only supports a limited set of device models.</p><h5>ii. 💸 Expensive Physical Devices</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/457ab6ec0d4f4335573264b78937f40d/real_device_pricing_chart.svg"><p>Real device test farms have an initial cost and require periodic maintenance, hence why they are more expensive than virtual device farms.</p><blockquote><p>Running 10 hours of test daily on real devices costs <strong>$1000/month</strong> (assuming 20 working days of equal levels of productivity).</p></blockquote><h3>1.2. 📱 Product</h3><p><strong>The key 🔑:</strong> Uber averts enormous maintenance costs by not owning all the cars on its global network. Similarly, with a distributed network of test devices, extensive device coverage is attainable with minimal maintenance costs. For one or two co-located devices, maintenance isn't fastidious.</p><blockquote><p>From <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf#faq">DeviceFramer STF</a> FAQ: "Aside from a single early failure we had within only a few months, all of our devices were doing fine for about two years. However, having reached the 2-3 year mark, several devices have started to experience visibly expanded batteries <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->
In our experience, the system runs just fine most of the time, and any issues are mostly USB-related. You'll usually have to do something about once a week."</p></blockquote><p>Organizations can decide what type of tests are ideal for DART and if the network is made-up of single nodes or clusters of nodes. The simple taxonomy of android testing below should be helpful. <!-- -->[1]</p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/3c544343e6de6b0d393c6101c4359694/taxonomy_android_testing.svg" alt="Taxonomy of Android testing"><p>The network can be internal to an organization. An example: <code>X</code> devices stored in HQ, each employee can remotely contribute their test device into the system.</p><p>It can also be external to an organization. Imagine paying people <code>$1.5/hour</code> of device time. Assuming a device runs test overnight (thanks to timezone differences), the estimated monthly earning is <code>$240</code> (<code>$1.5 * 8 hours * 20 working days</code>).</p><blockquote><p>The median income in some countries is ~$400/month. </p></blockquote><p>Below is a demo of the <a href="https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart">proof-of-concept</a>.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SotlhlwMDA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Currently, a simple dashboard renders the test summary.</p><div>

The server can use device logs, screenshots, videos with UUID, and past executions to validate submitted work results. As this isn't watertight, it is best combined with other strategies: user verifications, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet">device attestation</a>, randomization, and device throughput throttling.</p><p>Preventing product leaks is hard  — if it runs on a phone, any sufficiently motivated (&amp; knowledgeable) person can figure out a way to access objects. Three good-enough solutions are:</p><p>a. Running headless tests.</p><p>b. Using a private network of vetted devices.</p><p>c. Adopting only for binaries at the later end of the release pipeline.</p><h3>1.4. 🎃 Going Headless</h3><p>It is possible to obscure the application under test using a simple overlay. The video below shows the execution of the test cases of the Google IO 2019 app. On the right, the app interactions are invisible. Depending on the strategy, concealing actions do not affect screenshots or videos.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxwsoe3T8yE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With framework UI component wrappers, it is possible to borrow some ideas from <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/4db1f432b853152075923499768639e14403b73a/tools/layoutlib/README">Layoutlib</a> to offer a full headless solution. <code>Layoutlib</code> is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Eclipse. The goal of the library is to provide layout rendering in Eclipse that are very close to their rendering on devices.</p><h3>1.5. 📦 Containerization</h3><p>Tests need to run in an isolated environment. A plugin framework like <a href="https://github.com/didi/VirtualAPK">VirtualAPK</a> can be built to offer a layer of isolation between apps and the OS. This works using the <code>DexClassLoader</code> and some reflection hacks to modify framework components. With this approach, apps can be seamlessly loaded &amp; unloaded without any user interaction.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Before I got into productivity and performance, I used to spend many hours online ingesting vast troves of digital content. My information diet ranged from inspirational TED talks to specialized podcasts, from blog posts found on Hacker News to ebooks shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m deeply curious, and I gave in to new content as much as I could. What could be the harm?—I thought. I <em>loved</em> spending my time this way. It felt useful, it was fun, and it nurtured my self-image as a “smart guy” — all at the same time. Truly, a learning hack.</p>
<p>Turns out I wasn’t hacking anything: The learning wasn’t real.</p>
<p>A few months ago, doubts began to creep into my mind about the effectiveness of my habits.</p>
<p>While I’d amped up my information consumption, I wasn’t retaining most of it. My memory was behaving like a leaky bucket. Sure, I was spending tens of hours listening to politics on the radio. But when I tried to use any of those points in a conversation, I found that I didn’t actually know enough to make a coherent argument. <strong>I knew the surrounding context, but the moment I needed to get specific my argument would crumble</strong>. Same for many other topics: the more technical they were, the less retention I had.</p>
<p>Where did all that information go?</p>
<p>The problem lied in how I was seeing learning, and therefore how I was approaching it.</p>
<p>Learning is what turns information consumption into long-lasting knowledge. The two things are different: while information is ephemeral, true knowledge is foundational. If knowledge were a person, information would be its picture.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think of learning in <em>accretive</em> terms: if I stack up enough information, it will eventually turn into knowledge. We tend to judge the world in material terms, and if data were tangible, an indefinitely growing memory might be reasonable to assume. The more information I consume, the more information I store, the information data I can later retrieve. The more business newsletters I’ll read, the more I’ll know business.</p>
<p>However, this line of thinking wasn’t really applicable to my case: I was undoubtedly consuming many business newsletters each week, but that wasn’t translating into long-term business knowledge.</p>
<p>I spent the last eight months trying to find an answer to this riddle. It took me deep into the topic of meta-learning: How do humans learn? And how can we learn better in the digital information age?</p>
<h2 id="learning-must-be-effortful">Learning must be effortful</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for us, human memory does not resemble storage, and “passive accumulation” isn’t how learning happens.</p>
<p>The truth is that we retain information only when we put <em>serious effort</em> into the process of learning. The intrinsic effortfulness of learning is not just a byproduct of the core activity, like shortness of breath during running. On the contrary: it’s what <em>actually</em> <em>enables</em> it. The relationship is causal.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>I didn’t find a learning hack to avoid effort because there’s no such thing as easy learning: <strong>learning <em>must</em> be effortful in order for it to happen</strong>.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most is that learning is far more grounded in the physical world than I was comfortable admitting.</p>
<p>The most literal meaning of effort is <em>physical</em> effort (think of weight lifting at the gym). The same holds true with information retention: it works best when the process of assimilating it is <em>physically effortful</em>. Our memory shines when our learning is physical, visceral, and obvious, like the aching in your hands after a morning spent hand-writing.</p>
<p>Since they’re passive, easy, and exclusively digital, after this realization all my podcasts, e-books, audiobooks, newsletters, blog posts, videos, live webinars were suddenly deprived of their “<em>learning status</em>”. Instead, they assumed their proper place in my schedule as pure <em>entertainment</em> activities.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that digital products make it uniquely easy to trick yourself into thinking that you’re learning when you are actually being entertained.</p>
<p>What I still didn’t know was why our mind works like this. Is this just the current state of digital learning and teaching, or there’s actually a margin for <em>easy</em> learning to be found somewhere?</p>
<h2 id="the-neurology-of-learning">The neurology of learning</h2>
<p>I’m no expert in medicine, let alone neurology, but I did want to roughly understand what happens when we — as humans —&nbsp;create knowledge. Luckily I didn’t need profound medical expertise to get the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>Our brain is made of a web of interconnected neurons. The links between these neurons are called axons: long, slender projections of nerve fibers that transmit electrical impulses.</p>
<p>Around these axons, there’s an insulating membrane called myelin. It covers many neuronal axons and facilitates the propagation of electrical signals along neuronal circuits. The more myelin around an axon, the stronger and more connected the signal transmission will be.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_2.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Myelin is to neural transmissions as oxygen is to fire. It allows rapid information transfer over long distances, and it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261127">greatly increases</a> the speed of propagation of electric signals in our brain.</p>
<p>See it as water flowing through a pipe with dynamic, changing capacity. Pipes with greater capacity can move more water, more quickly than a small pipe or a slow drip. The more myelin supporting a neural connection, the easier it is to use that connection — and thus to use the skill or remember the topic associated with that connection</p>
<p>A key aspect of myelin is that it’s highly dynamic. It’s an integral component of our brain plasticity. So the question becomes: how is myelin generated, and why?</p>
<p>When we come across a new topic, new regions of the brain start activating. The more we use those new regions, the more myelin is synthesized, the easier that topic (or activity) gets.</p>
<p>We all know the old saying <em>practice makes perfect</em>. The more we use a certain region of our brain, the more our brain “prioritizes” and “hones” it. That is what leads to myelin: activity induces myelination, which leads to increased strength of connectivity and efficiency along those very neurons. It’s a self-reinforcing process.</p>
<p>In other words, it compounds.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://giansegato.com/img/essays/edutainment-not-learning/image_3.png"> 
</figure>

<p>See now why it’s so hard to learn? To learn anything we must make active use of unexplored regions of our brain <em>before</em> they’re ready. It’s, quite literally, getting out of the comfort zone. The more we use them, the more they get better. <strong>Learning is <em>structurally</em> hard.</strong></p>
<p>The truly mesmerizing thing about myelination is that it is correlated with active use of <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4351">motor neurons</a></em>. It looks like human cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor processes: we retain information better when we associate some <em>physical activity</em> to it. <strong>The general intuition is that movement provides additional cues we can use to retrieve knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>We can see this effect happening when we take notes. A larger corpus of research is suggesting that taking notes physically — that is, by hand-writing them — is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">far more effective</a> than using a laptop. Keyboarding does not provide tactile feedback to the brain that the contact between pencil and paper does: this contact, this raw feedback, is the key to creating the neurocircuitry in the hand-brain complex, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">evidence shows</a> supports memory and retention.</p>
<p>All of this means <strong>we need to radically reassess digital learning</strong>. We haven’t evolved to store information by passively watching Masterclass videos: that’s just not how our minds work.</p>
<p>However, the other side of this coin is that we’re living in times of unprecedented information surplus. This is an opportunity that we should learn to seize.</p>
<h2 id="creative-learning-in-a-digital-world">Creative learning in a digital world</h2>
<p>The best way to describe my information diet before discovering that effort is instrumental to learning would be <em>edutainment</em>.</p>
<p>Edutainment mixes education topics with entertainment methodologies. Even if edutainment optimizes for passive attention instead of effortful engagement (the opposite of learning), it’s not just “mere fun.” Deleting Twitter and unsubscribing from newsletters, as suggested by Deep Work advocates like <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>, can actually end up <em>preventing</em> learning.</p>
<p>I see edutainment as <em>preparation for learning</em>: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running.</p>
<p>Within this framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into <em>scouting for learning opportunities</em>. It’s yet another searching problem where it’s key to balance the exploration of new opportunities with the commitment to the existing ones — a topic I wrote about at length in <a href="https://giansegato.com/essays/the-ebb-and-the-flow-of-product-development/">another essay</a>. It’s about balancing the time spent “scouting” for interesting topics online with the offline effort needed for long-term retention and integration.</p>
<hr>


<hr>
<p>Pragmatically, I solved this trade-off with a powerful tool: a learning inbox.</p>
<p>A learning inbox is a to-do list for stuff I’d like to actually learn. I picked up the idea from Andy Matuschak — legendary ed-tech expert —, who <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_reading_inbox_to_capture_possibly-useful_references">used a similar concept</a> as a tool for capturing possibly-useful references. The learning inbox is a system that forces me to be mindful about what content is <em>learning</em>, and what is at the end of the day just <em>entertainment</em>.</p>
<p>Everything interesting I find on my way is sent to my learning inbox and from there gets triaged, be it a paper, an online essay, a blog post, a YouTube video, or a podcast. When an item ends up in there, there are three things that can happen: I either decide to actively engage with it, to file for future interest, or just trash it. Active engagement is exactly what it sounds like: <strong>I need to take effortful action to consume the content in the list</strong>, otherwise I automatically bucket it as entertainment.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to do something with it. To <em>create</em> something. Write a blog post about it, use it in a new project, test it on the field, teach it at a meetup. That’s why I speak at <a href="https://giansegato.com/about/#talks">many conferences</a>: it’s a learning tool.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD fashion</a>, permanence in this list is temporary. It’s a release valve, not a …</p></div></div>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

		<p>It has been almost two years since Talos was first announced to the world. ARM support was almost immediately a feature request. At the time the project had major features missing that needed to be implemented before we could even <em>think</em> about Talos on ARM. Only after forming a company, hiring a kick ass team, and pouring a tremendous amount of time and love into Talos have we finally been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>The Talos team is proud to announce support for four ARM single board computers (SBCs) in our latest alpha release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
<li>Pine64 Rock64</li>
<li>Banana Pi M64</li>
<li>Libre Computer ALL-H3-CC H5 (Tritium)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those not familiar with Talos, it is an ultra minimal OS with an API instead of ssh+shell built for the purpose of running Kubernetes with security as a priority. The image is immutable, the runtime is ephemeral, and the configuration is declarative. For more on what all of this means, see our documentation at <a href="https://www.talos.dev/">https://www.talos.dev/</a>. We think you will love it.</p>
<p>Landing support for SBCs signifies a huge milestone for Talos. You can now run Talos nearly anywhere you can imagine. The same Talos is able to run in the cloud, on-premise, and now at the edge. This means you get a resource efficient, secure, and reliable OS running the same vanilla Kubernetes that you run in production datacenters - wherever you might need it.</p>
<p>We are looking to add support for more boards. Please, let us know what boards you might be interested in by creating an issue in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/talos-systems/talos">repo</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/rust-gh.png" alt="gh template releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example/blob/01e0aae91f83e1e932f4498a0eddb2905c8fffc3/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L57-L63">This</a>
is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoIeni">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MarcoIeni">YouTube</a>, bye! 👋</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

<h2>A Compendium of 58 Effective Strategies, Techniques and Methods</h2>

<p>Managing your own time is an essential skill in today’s fast-paced world. It's also more challenging than ever. Fortunately, there are many <strong>time management strategies that can help you become organized and efficient</strong>. Use this overview of 58 strategies and techniques to find the ones that work best for you.</p>
<!-- It’s hard to keep track of all the time management strategies out there. Productivity gurus tend to create their own, building on the massive fundus of existing strategies. So to get you ready for the next time someone mentions their favorite but obscure time management technique, here is an exhaustive overview of more than 50 strategies. -->
<h2>Deep Planning</h2>
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/funktionsgrafik-play-store-2019-10-18.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve"/> -->
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/values-finder-banner.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve" style="max-width: 100%"/> -->

<!-- Did we just complain about everybody creating their own time management strategy? Well, obviously it’s all right if we do it, isn’t it? :) -->
<p>Most plans are strictly sequential. When you invariably have to adjust your plan to reality, you have to update the whole lengthy sequence. Time-consuming at best, motivation consuming at worst. With deep planning, you create a simple hierarchy instead.</p>
<p>Think about what you want to achieve this year. Based on that, what do you want to achieve this month? This week? Today? This way you create a long-term strategy and still adjust your plans with little effort.</p>
<!-- At the end of each period, take a step back and reflect. What went well? What not? What can I do differently next time? -->
<p>Curious? Then take a look at <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/time-management-app/">Focality, our time management app</a>. Focality combines deep planning, self-reflection and data-driven insights to let you constantly improve your time management skills.</p>
<h2>The complete list of time management strategies</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here comes the complete list of time management techniques in alphabetic order:</p>
<h3>1-3-5 rule</h3>
<p>For every day, create a list of one big thing, three medium things and five small things that you want to accomplish this day. This brings clarity into your workday and helps not to get buried by an endless flood of to-do items.</p>
<h3>2-Hour Solution</h3>
<p>See Two-Hour Solution.</p>
<h3>2-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>There are two 2-Minute Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you want to establish a new habit, make sure that it requires no more than 2 minutes in the beginning. Work yourself up from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Getting Things Done methodology (see below), if a task takes only 2 minutes or less, then do it right away instead of organizing it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>10-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>If you are putting something off, force yourself to do it for just 10 minutes. Chances are that you will continue past the 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>18 Minutes</h3>
<p>Start your day by planning what you will do that day for 5 minutes. Every hour, take one minute, review your progress and refocus. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to reflect and evaluate your day.</p>
<h3>4Ds of Time Management</h3>
<p>This method helps you to quickly decide what to do with a task. Either Do it, Defer it, Delegate it or Drop it.</p>
<h3>7 Minute Life</h3>
<p>Spend 7 minutes in the morning to plan your day. Then another 7 minutes in the evening to reflect. Accompanied by many <a href="https://the7minutelife.com/member-tools/">templates</a>.</p>
<h3>80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a rule of thumb that states that 80% of the effect step from 20% of the causes. Applied to time management it means that you can get 80% of the results with just 20% of the work. Getting to 100% will require disproportionately more work. Perfect is the enemy of done.</p>
<h3>90-Minute Rule / 90-Minute Focus Sessions / 90-Minute Solution</h3>
<p>Align your work with your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle">basic rest–activity cycle</a> by doing focused work for approximately 90 minutes, followed by a 20-minute break. The following article sums it up nicely: <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/avoid-burnout-and-increase-awareness-using-ultradian-rhythms-5e64158e7e19">Avoid Burnout and Increase Awareness Using Ultradian Rhythms</a></p>
<h3>ABCDE Method</h3>
<p>Created by Brian Tracy, ABCDE is a method for setting priorities. Basically assign each task a priority from A to E. A: Very important, must do. B: Important, should do. C: Nice to do, without consequence if skipped. D: Delegate. E: Eliminate.</p>
<h3>Action Method</h3>
<p>Leave every meeting, workshop or other event with a set of concrete tasks that need to be performed, called “action steps”. These should be kept separately from accompanying information (“reference items”). Everything that can’t / shouldn’t be approached right now becomes a “backburner item” to be possibly revived later. The method was developed by Behance. There used to be an online tool that implemented the action method, but it  was discontinued in 2015.</p>
<h3>Agile Results</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/">Agile Results</a> technique is heavily inspired by software development frameworks like Scrum. At the beginning of the week, identify three wins that you want to achieve. Each day, identify three wins for that day. Use Fridays to recognize three things that are going well and three things to improve. Accompanied by a set of further practices to improve your time management like 30 day improvement sprints, reference collections and more.</p>
<h3>Autofocus</h3>
<p><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Autofocus</a> is a to-do list methodology by Mark Forster which tries to use as little structure as possible. Dump everything in a ruled notebook. Scan your list and work on what stands out for as long as you feel like it. Then cross the item off the list. If you haven’t finished it, add it to the bottom again. Repeat. If you pass through a whole page (except the latest page) without anything standing out, dismiss all items on that page.</p>
<h3>Batching / Time Batching / Task Batching</h3>
<p>Work on batches of similar tasks instead of mixing unrelated ones. It reduces friction by minimizing context switching.</p>
<h3>Biological Prime Time</h3>
<p>Track your energy levels and identify your most energetic times of the day. Schedule your most important work for those times. First described by Sam Carpenter in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6019060-work-the-system">Work the System</a>.</p>
<h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
<p>A bullet journal combines to-do list, planning and journaling. The name bullet journal comes from the extensive use of bullet(ish) points to structure and mark information.</p>
<h3>COPE</h3>
<p>The Clear-Organized-Productive-Efficient technique helps you to eliminate low-value activities and prioritize everything so that you can focus on the things with the most impact.</p>
<h3>Don’t break the chain</h3>
<p>See Seinfeld Strategy.</p>
<h3>Eat That Frog</h3>
<p>Tackle the biggest and/or most difficult and/or most disliked task first thing in the morning. Then you won’t waste energy or distract yourself the rest of the day because you are secretly dreading that task. <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">Eat That Frog</a> was created by Brian Tracy who named it after a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Matrix / Box / Method / Principle</h3>
<p>Former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower used to rate his problems by the two criteria urgency and importance. These criteria are commonly used as axis on a 2x2 matrix with 4 quadrants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Urgent and important</li>
<li>Not urgent and important</li>
<li>Urgent but not important</li>
<li>Not urgent and not important</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eisenhower Matrix helps you to better prioritize your tasks and avoid the urgency trap where you fill your day with everything that’s urgent and neglecting the important.</p>
<h3>Final Version</h3>
<p>Start with a list of tasks. Select the first one on the list. Think about which other task from the list you would rather do. Select that one but remember/mark the first. Repeat until you no longer want to do anything before the currently selected task. Then work on the tasks in this chain - but in reverse order! Once you are done with the chain start the process again with the next open task on the list. Reference: <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html">The Final Version newsletter</a></p>
<h3>Flowtime Technique</h3>
<p>Work on only one task at a time. When you start, write down the time. Continue working on the task until you feel that you need a break. If you are exhausted or can’t focus anymore, take a break. Write down the stop time. Decide how long this break should be and set a timer for it. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Fresh or Fried</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, when your brain is fried, prioritize your tasks for the next day. Schedule important tasks to the beginning of the day, when your brain is still fresh. Schedule less important or easier tasks towards the later parts of the day when your brain fries again.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://thefyslife.com/article/fresh-or-fried-productivity/">Dominate Your Day With the “Fresh or Fried” Prioritization System</a></p>
<h3>Getting Things Done (GTD)</h3>
<p>Getting Things Done is a famous method created by David Allen. It makes extensive use of to-do lists and techniques to manage them. At its core it employs five basic activities to bring structure to your task management:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture everything: Don’t keep tasks in your head, write everything down.</li>
<li>Clarify: Make sure all your items are clear and actionable.</li>
<li>Organize: Use categories, priorities and due dates to bring structure to your lists.</li>
<li>Review: Frequently go over your lists. Update priorities, remove outdated items, etc.</li>
<li>Engage: Do it.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">Goal Setting</a></h3>
<p>Goal setting is the process of defining what you want to achieve in the long-term (or mid-term). Instead of focusing just on tasks, it helps you getting direction in life. If you don’t have clear goals, you are basically adrift. And you hardly get to where you want to be by accident.</p>
<p>We have compiled an <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">extensive guide to personal goal setting</a> which will help you to understand the topic in depth. Learn why it is important, what types of goals to set, attributes of well-defined goals and much, much more.</p>
<h3>Inbox Zero</h3>
<p>This strategy focuses on managing your email inbox with maximum efficiency. According to its creator, Merlin Mann, the name Inbox Zero does not refer to the number of emails in your inbox, but “how long it takes to use the inbox”. Basically, you run every incoming email through a short process in which you do one of the following things: Delete, delegate, respond, defer (to do later), do (immediately).</p>
<h3>Ivy Lee Method</h3>
<p>This time management strategy has been created in 1918 by productivity consultant Ivy Lee. He recommends writing down six tasks at the end of each day that you want to accomplish the next day. Order them by importance. Then, on the next day, work your way down the list. At the end of the day, move any uncompleted task to the list for the next day. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Medium Method</h3>
<p>Combine the strengths of digital and paper tools. Chad Hall’s <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/medium-method">Medium Method</a> employs paper notebooks, post-it notes, a task-management app, an online calendar and a note app.</p>
<h3>MIT: Most Important Tasks</h3>
<p>Write down the most important tasks for the next day. Up to three. At the beginning of the day, focus on those and do nothing else until your MITs are completed.</p>
<h3>MoSCow Prioritization</h3>
<p>Borrowed from requirements management this technique helps you prioritize your tasks. Give each task a priority of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                        <h3>Abstract</h3>
                        
                        
                            <p>It has been claimed that left-wingers or liberals (US sense) tend to more often suffer from mental illness than right-wingers or conservatives. This potential link was investigated using the General Social Survey cumulative cross-sectional dataset (1972-2018). A search of the available variables resulted in 5 items measuring one's own mental illness (e.g., ”Do you have any emotional or mental disability?”). All of these items were weakly associated with left-wing political ideology as measured by self-report, with especially high rates seen for the “extremely liberal” group. These results mostly held up in regressions that adjusted for age, sex, and race. For the variable with the most data (n = 11,338), the difference in the mental illness measure between “extremely liberal” and “extremely conservative” was 0.39 d. Temporal analysis showed that the relationship between mental illness, happiness, and political ideology has existed in the GSS data since the 1970s and still existed in the 2010s. Within-study meta-analysis of all the results found that extreme liberals had a 150% increased rate of mental illness compared to moderates. The finding of increased mental illness among left-wingers is congruent with numerous findings based on related constructs, such as positive relationships between conservatism, religiousness and health in general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is going to be a quick tour of the essential aspects of <code>stack</code> targeted at beginners. It will not only list commands that should be executed but would try to provide contextual explanations as much as possible. The aim is to give an introduction to <code>stack</code> that is not filled with commands to be memorized but one that can help the beginner to start forming a better understanding of <code>stack</code> so they can explore the tool further on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clarifying-terms">Clarifying terms</h2>

<p>It is important to have an understanding of some basic terms and concepts when it comes to working and building Haskell programs. This includes understanding what is meant when we say things like <em>Cabal</em>, the difference between <em>Modules, Libraries, Packages</em>, etc. These terms were already explained in the previous post, so instead of reproducing it again here, please take a moment to read the <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> in the Whirlwind Tour Of Cabal For Beginners post.</p>

<p>One thing to point out regarding the concepts of packages and projects is that <code>stack</code> provides configuration for projects via a file called <code>stack.yaml</code>, while packages are configured via either <code>package.yaml</code> file or <code>.cabal</code> file. These files are covered in more depth in <a href="#creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="what-stack-is">What Stack is</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> is a build tool for Haskell. It is an alternative to <code>cabal-install</code>, but still makes use of cabal the package format and Cabal the library. It has a strong focus on reproducible build plans. It was conceived to solve dependency problems (commonly referred to as cabal hell) that used to plague <code>cabal-install</code>. It does this by providing a curated package set that is guaranteed to always compile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be stressed that the cabal hell issue that used to plague cabal-install has mostly been resolved. The solution took a different approach than what <code>stack</code> employed. It made use of an approach similar to what is obtained in Nix. The details of this are not important, just that using either <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>is now a matter of preference and UX choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="moving-parts">Moving parts</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> also comes with some moving parts and terms that could be confusing to a beginner. In this section, these terms are explained before moving to how to install <code>stack</code>.</p>

<h3 id="curated-package-set">Curated Package Set</h3>

<p>Hackage is Haskell’s central package archive of open-source software. Anyone can upload (and also download) packages from Hackage hence it contains different versions of packages that are not guaranteed to be compatible. A curated package set is then a subset of packages from Hackage which are regularly tested for compatibility. <code>stack</code> makes use of the idea of a curated package set to resolve the problem of incompatible dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="stackage">Stackage</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> is the central package archive of open-source software of Haskell packages <strong>that have been curated and tested for compatibility</strong>. Hence the curated package set used by <code>stack</code> is hosted on Stackage. Stackage is spearheaded by folks at <a href="http://www.fpcomplete.com/">fpcomplete</a>, but is still a community effort, hence anyone can also <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#adding-a-package">submit packages</a> for inclusion in the curated package set that is hosted on Stackage.</p>

<h3 id="resolver">Resolver</h3>

<p>It is easy to imagine the need for versioning when working with these curated package sets hosted on Stackage. Where a particular version uniquely identifies a particular curated package set and the packages it contains. In <code>stack</code>, the version of a curated package set is referred to or specified as a <em>resolver</em>.</p>

<p>A resolver uniquely identifies the GHC version and the other Haskell packages contained within a package set. Package sets that have been thoroughly tested and would be maintained for a long period are identified by LTS (long term support) resolver version numbers, while package sets that are still in flux are identified by nightly resolvers. The available LTS resolvers can be found <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts">here</a> while nightly resolvers can be seen <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly">here</a>. For example <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts-16.22">lts-16.22</a>, is a LTS Resolver, while <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2020-11-19">nightly-2020-11-19</a> is a nightly Resolver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on its name, it might be tempting to think of resolver as a piece of software that performs the act of resolution. A better way is to see the resolver as an identifier or a tag. It is a way to refer to a particular curated package set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hpack">hpack</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> Haskell makes use of cabal package format, a text-based, key-value format used to describe a Haskell package. <code>hpack</code> is an alternate format to cabal package format. Instead of a custom key-value text-based format, it makes use of <a href="https://yaml.org/"><code>yaml</code></a>.</p>

<p>So while the cabal package format uses a custom key-value text-based format specified in a file ending with <code>.cabal</code> extension, <code>hpack</code> uses <code>yaml</code> with package descriptions specified in <code>package.yaml</code> file. <code>stack</code>has inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code>. This means <code>stack</code>can parse <code>hpack</code>s’ <code>package.yaml</code> and use it to generate <code>.cabal</code> file.</p>

<p>In summary, you can view <code>stack</code>as a Haskell build tool, that makes use of curated package sets, identified by resolvers and hosted on Stackage, with inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code> as an alternative package specification format.</p>

<h2 id="installing-stack">Installing Stack</h2>

<p>Installing <code>stack</code>is straight forward. On Un*x operating systems, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On windows, the provided <a href="https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe">Windows Installer</a> can be used</p>

<p>To confirm <code>stack</code>is properly installed run <code>stack --version</code> which will give an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack <span>--version</span>
Version 2.3.3, Git revision cb44d51bed48b723a5deb08c3348c0b3ccfc437e x86_64 hpack-0.33.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you do not need to install GHC separately when using <code>stack</code>. <code>stack</code>handles getting the version of GHC needed for each project created. This is also one of the ways in which <code>stack</code>differs from <code>cabal-install</code> which requires GHC to be separately downloaded and installed. So <code>stack</code>not only takes care of resolving dependencies, compiling Haskell code, it also handles the management of the toolchain required to do this, and GHC is included in the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>

<p>Now we have <code>stack</code>installed, the next thing to do is to create a new Haskell project. Doing this is straightforward. To create a new project, run <code>stack new</code>.</p>

<p>Doing so will produce an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack new firstproject
Downloading template <span>"new-template"</span> to create project <span>"firstproject"</span> <span>in </span>firstproject/ ...

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-name
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-name: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span>

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-email, author-name, category, copyright, github-username
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-email: value
    author-name: value
    category: value
    copyright: value
    github-username: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-email:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"category:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"copyright:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"github-username:value"</span>

Looking <span>for</span> .cabal or package.yaml files to use to init the project.
Using cabal packages:
- firstproject/

Selecting the best among 18 snapshots...

<span>*</span> Matches lts-16.22

Selected resolver: lts-16.22
Initialising configuration using resolver: lts-16.22
Total number of user packages considered: 1
Writing configuration to file: firstproject/stack.yaml
All <span>done</span><span>.</span>
/Users/schooloffp/.stack/templates/new-template.hsfiles:    3.72 KiB downloaded...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above command will create a directory named <code>firstproject</code> with will contain the source files for the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above command creates a project based on a default template which dictates the default files and configuration that will be created. It should be noted that it is possible to pass an extra option together with <code>new</code> that specifies the template that <code>stack</code>should use to create a new project. When the template option is left out, <code>stack</code>uses the <code>new-template</code> template by default. Hence <code>stack new firstproject</code> is same as running <code>stack new firstproject new-template</code>. Run <code>stack templates</code> to see the available templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state of the directory after running <code>stack new firstproject</code> can be seen:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>tree firstproject/
firstproject/
├── ChangeLog.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── Setup.hs
├── app
│   └── Main.hs
├── firstproject.cabal
├── package.yaml
├── src
│   └── Lib.hs
├── stack.yaml
└── <span>test</span>
    └── Spec.hs
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s take a pause to talk about the files generated after running the <code>stack new</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="changelogmd">ChangeLog.md</h3>

<p>As is evident in the name, this is a markdown file that should be used to capture the revision history for the project.</p>

<h3 id="license">LICENSE</h3>

<p>This is where the license governing the project is specified, as also evident in the name.</p>

<h3 id="readmemd">README.md</h3>

<p>The well-known README file.</p>

<h3 id="setuphs">Setup.hs</h3>
<p>The <code>Setup.hs</code> file comes in handy in the scenario where one needs to circumvent tools like <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>for direct usage of the Cabal library when compiling Cabal packages. The <code>Setup.hs</code> is, in essence, a runnable Haskell program that can be further configured and used to compile Cabal packages.</p>

<p>This is an exceptional use case. Everyday Haskell development would …</p></div></div>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

During the study, some participants were instructed to wear special glasses that blocked blue light wavelengths whilst the rest didn't. The results showed that the people in the study that wore these glasses produced more melatonin than those who didn’t and hence, had a better night's sleep.</span></p><p id="viewer-8nqqi"><span>These studies do seem pretty conclusive, however since then others have said otherwise.</span></p><p id="viewer-8kim"><span>In 2019, a group of researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31368-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>challenged that notion</u></a>. After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue. Warm-toned light, they hypothesized, could trick the body into thinking it’s daytime, while cooler blue light more closely mimics twilight.</span></p><p id="viewer-7o6g0"><span>It is important to note however, that animals studies don't always reflect the entire reality, as they often can't translate directly to human behavior. Furthermore, since rodents are nocturnal, they may respond differently to light than humans do. Finally the lights were also kept very dim, regardless of color, which may not property represent the bright lights of electronics.</span></p><p id="viewer-b6bbs"><span>Because of these conditions, the results of the study can't be taken too seriously, given how many previous ones have concluded that Blue Light has a negative impact on sleep.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-2fn3f"><span>How to minimise the effects </span></h3><p id="viewer-ctu4b"><span>If you're worried that Blue Light might be affecting your sleep, here are a few solutions:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-fljja"><p>First of all, try and <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cut down on your screen time</u></a>.

<p>The C++, eh C, preprocessor is wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, no - it isn’t wonderful.</p>
<p>It is a primitive text replacement tool that must be used to work with C++.
But is “must” really true?
Most of the usage has become obsolete thanks to new and better C++ language features.
And many more features like modules will come soon™.
So can we get rid of the preprocessor?
And if so, how can we do it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Much of the preprocessor use is already bad practice:
Don’t use it for symbolic constants, don’t use it for inline functions etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this gained a lot of traction, let me clarify something:
I’m not advocating for removing the preprocessor with this post.
Some people in the C++ community and many on the standardization committee want to do that, however,
so I wanted to explore the feasibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there still a few ways it is used in idiomatic C++.
Let’s go through them and see what alternative we have.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the most common usage:
<code>#include</code> a header file.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>In order to compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the declarations of all functions that are being called.
So if you define a function in one file,
and want to call it in another, you have to declare it in that file as well.
Only then can the compiler generate the appropriate code to call the function.</p>
<p>Of course, manually copying the declaration can lead to errors:
If you change the signature you have to change all declarations as well.
So, instead of manually copying the declarations,
you write them in a special file - the header file,
and let the preprocessor copy it for you with <code>#include</code>.
Now you still need to update all declarations, but just in one place.</p>
<p>But plain text inclusion is dumb.
It can sometimes happens that the same file gets included twice,
which leads to two copies of that file.
This is no problem for function declarations,
but if you have class definitions in an header file,
that’s an error.</p>
<p>To prevent that, you have to use include guards or the non-standard <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>With current C++ features, we can’t (without resorting to copy pasta).</p>
<p>But with the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4647.pdf">Modules TS</a> we can.
Instead of providing header files and source files,
we can write a module and <code>import</code> that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about modules, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjvh127abfw">most recent CppChat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional Compilation</h2>
<p>The second most common job of the preprocessor is conditional compilation:
Change the definitions/declarations by defining or not defining a macro.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed-1">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>Consider the situation where you’re writing a library that provides a function <code>draw_triangle()</code>
which draws a single triangle on the screen.</p>
<p>Now the declaration is straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// draws a single triangle
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the implementation of the function changes depending on your operating system, window manager, display manager
and/or moon phase (for exotic window manager).</p>
<p>So you need something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// use this one for Windows
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using the WinAPI 
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using DirectX
</span><span></span><span>}</span>

<span>// use this one for Linux
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using X11
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using OpenGL
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The preprocessor helps there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if _WIN32
</span><span></span>    <span>// Windows triangle drawing code here 
</span><span></span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>// Linux triangle drawing code here
</span><span></span><span>#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>The code in the branch that is not taken will be deleted before compilation,
so we won’t get any errors about missing APIs etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-1">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>C++17 adds <code>if constexpr</code>, this can be used to replace simple <code>#if … #else</code>:</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>#if DEBUG_MODE
</span><span></span>        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>#endif
</span><span></span>    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can write this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>DEBUG_MODE</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> is <code>false</code>, then the branch will not be compiled properly,
it will only check for syntax errors, similar to the checking done for a not yet instantiated template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not correct, as was pointed out.
It will still be fully checked if outside a template.
It doesn’t matter here though, as it still doesn’t have any runtime overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is even better than <code>#if</code> as it will spot obvious errors in the code without checking all macro combinations.
Another benefit with <code>if constexpr</code> is that <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> can now be a normal <code>constexpr</code> variable,
instead of a constant coming from a macro expansion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you don’t have <code>if constexpr</code>, you can use class template specializations,
or <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2015/11/16/overload-resolution-3.html">tag dispatching</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are downsides to <code>if constexpr</code>:
You can’t use it to constrain preprocessor directives, i.e. <code>#include</code>.
For the <code>draw_triangle()</code> example, the code needs to include the proper system header.
<code>if constexpr</code> can help, so you’d need true conditional compilation there or manually copy the declarations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is better than normally as system header declarations are usually pretty stable.
But it’s still not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And modules can’t help either as the system headers do not define any module you can import.
Furthermore, you can’t conditionally import a module (as far as I know).</p>
<h2 id="passing-configuration-options">Passing configuration options</h2>
<p>On a related note, you sometimes want to pass some configuration options to a library.
You might want to enable or disable assertions, precondition checks, change some default behavior…</p>
<p>For example, it might have a header like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#ifndef USE_ASSERTIONS
</span><span></span>    <span>// default to enable
</span><span></span>    <span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 1
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>#ifndef DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION
</span><span></span>    <span>// use the general implementation
</span><span></span>    <span>#define DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION general_foo
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When building the library you can then override the macros either when invoking the compiler,
or through CMake, for example.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-2">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>Macros are the obvious choice here, but there are is an alternative:</p>
<p>We could use a different strategy to pass options,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design">policy-based design</a>,
where you pass a policy to a class template that defines the chosen behavior.
This has the benefit that it doesn’t force a single implementation to all users,
but of course has <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2017/02/08/policy-based-design-problem.html">its own downsides</a>.</p>
<p>But what I’d really like to see is the ability to pass these configuration options when you <code>import</code> the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>import</span> <span>my</span><span>.</span><span>module</span><span>(</span><span>use_assertions</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This would be the ideal replacement for:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 0
</span><span>#include</span> <span>"my_library.hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>But I don’t think that’s technically feasible without sacrificing the benefits modules provide,
i.e. pre-compiling modules.</p>
<h2 id="assertion-macros">Assertion macros</h2>
<p>The macro you’ll most commonly use probably does some kind of assertion.
And macros are the obvious choice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to conditionally disable assertions and remove them so they have zero overhead in release.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can use the pre-defined <code>__LINE__</code>, <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__func__</code> to get the location where the assertion is
and use that in the diagnostic.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can also stringify the expression that is being checked and use it in the diagnostic as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why almost all assertions are macros.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-3">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>I’ve already explored how conditional compilation can be replaced and how you can specify whether or not they should be enabled,
so that’s no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using policy-based design here also allows customization of how the diagnostic is reported to the user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the file information is also possible in the Library Fundamentals TS v2 as it adds <code>std::experimental::source_location</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>my_assertion</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span> <span>loc</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>())</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
        <span>report_error</span><span>(</span><span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>file_name</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>function_name</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>std::experimental::source_location::current()</code> expands to the information about the source file at the point of writing it.
Furthermore, if you use it as a default argument, it will expand to the caller location.
So the second point is no problem either.</p>
<p>The third point is the critical one:
You can’t stringify the expression and print it in the diagnostic without using a macro.
If you’re okay with that, you can implement your assertion function today.</p>
<p>But otherwise you still need a macro for that.
Check out <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2016/09/16/assertions.html">this blog post</a> how you could implement an (almost) macro-less assertion function,
where you can control the level with <code>constexpr</code> variables instead of macros.
You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/foonathan/debug_assert">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-macros">Compatibility macros</h2>
<p>Not all compilers support all C++ features, which makes porting a real pain,
especially if you don’t have access to a compiler for a testing and need to do the “change a line, push to CI, wait for CI build, change another line” cycle just because some compiler really doesn’t like an important C++ feature!</p>
<p>Anyways, the usual compatibility problems can be solved with macros.
The implementations even define certain macros once they’ve implemented a feature,
making checking trivial:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if __cpp_noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond) noexcept(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) noexcept(Expr)
</span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) false
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>

<span>void</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>NOEXCEPT</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This allows a portable usage of features even though not all compilers have them already.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it-4">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>We can’t do that in any other way.
Workaround missing features requires some kind of preprocessing tool to get rid of not-supported features.
We have to use macros here.</p>
<h2 id="boilerplate-macros">Boilerplate macros</h2>
<p>C++’s templates and TMP go a long way to eliminate a lot of boilerplate code you otherwise need to write.
But sometimes, you just need to write a lot of code that is the same but not <em>quite</em> the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>less</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>greater</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Macros can generate that boilerplate for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define MAKE_COMP(Name, Op) \
</span><span>struct Name \
</span><span>{ \
</span><span>    bool operator()(const foo&amp; a, const foo&amp; b) \
</span><span>    { \
</span><span>        return a.bar Op b.bar; \
</span><span>    } \
</span><span>};
</span><span></span>
<span>MAKE_COMP</span><span>(</span><span>less</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>)</span>
<span>M…</span></code></pre></div></article></div></div>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>

  <p>– Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above maxim has guided most of my career as a software engineer and has been one of
the central <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> of the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">community Clojure style guide</a>,
that I’ve been maintaining for the past (almost) 8 years.</p>

<p>While the style guide was well received by the Clojure community in general, and universal agreement was reached on most points in it, one aspect
remains controversial to this day - namely the style guide’s preference towards “semantic indentation” over “fixed indentation” for function/macro
arguments. Today I want to address an article that suggested that fixed indentation is preferable, as it’s simpler and it’s easier to provide tooling support for it.
That article is named <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/">Better Clojure Formatting</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which admittedly is catchy and made me consider naming my
response to it “The Best Clojure Formatting” or “Superb Clojure Formatting”, but I’ve opted for a more modest title in the end.</p>

<h2 id="prologue-the-purpose-of-formatting">Prologue: The Purpose of Formatting</h2>

<p>Have you ever thought why formatting (layout) is important at all?
Not just in code, but in any text in general.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer to this question is quite simple - proper formatting
can enhance a lot the readability of any text. And here’s also the crux
of it - computers don’t really care about readability. As long as some
code is syntactically correct any compiler or interpreter would be happy
to compile or run it.</p>

<p>For us humans, however, formatting can be very helpful or extremely confusing.
As far as I’m concerned any formatting that makes some code easier to read and
comprehend is good formatting.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-semantic-formatting">Introducing Semantic Formatting</h2>

<p>Before I go into my arguments let’s briefly contrast semantic and fixed indentation with a couple of examples.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Semantic indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>something-else</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines (wide formatting)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines (narrow formatting)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>


</span><span>;;; Fixed indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>something-else</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
  </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope it’s obvious that the main difference is that “semantic indentation” differentiates between macros with body forms and regular function/macro invocations.
That makes it easy to visually tell them apart. The “fixed indentation” approach, however, advocates ignoring those differences and indenting everything the same way.</p>

<p>A different way to think about semantic indentation might be to compare it to syntax highlighting - normally different constructs in a programming language (e.g. special forms, built-in functions and user-defined functions), get highlighted
differently, to reflect their semantics and to assist the reader in comprehending what they are dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are other aspects of “semantic indentation” as well, but I’ll stick only to the most prominent/infamous parts in this article.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-formatting-vs-fixed-formatting">Semantic Formatting vs Fixed Formatting</h2>

<p>The main argument for “semantic formatting” is pretty simple - it
reflects better the semantics of your code, which results in improved
clarity/readability. Just by looking at the shape of the code you can
infer how something is supposed to behave.</p>

<p>A secondary argument might be that’s also the formatting that has been employed by
all major Lisp dialects (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp) for a very long time.
Some might argue that following in their footsteps is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo culting</a>,
but if the premise behind their approach is still relevant today I don’t think the cargo cult theory has any merit.</p>

<p>Clojure developers have historically had a love/hate relationship with Lisp tradition, depending on their background.
That’s normal, given that Clojure was often marketed as a modern Lisp that break away from some arcane Lisp dogmas and traditions
and aligns itself with modern programming practices.
Tradition, however, doesn’t always mean bad, obsolete and irrelevant. In the case of semantic indentation, I think Clojure’s
predecessors had the right idea and nothing has fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>The main argument in favor of “fixed indentation” is tooling support - if you don’t need to format something differently, obviously creating code formatters becomes easier. There’s nothing for the formatter to parse/analyze, and there’s no need for configuration. Simplicity is generally a good thing, so this definitely sounds appealing.
While, I’m all for consistency and good tooling support, I think those are also achievable with semantic indentation in the case of Clojure (although a bit harder). Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For many macros you can infer the right indentation just by looking for a <code>body</code> parameter:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span>
  </span><span>"Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do."</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>'if</span><span> </span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> </span><span>'do</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there will also be counter-examples that need special handling, as they used some non-conventional names, but
this simple heuristic will work quite well most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Common Lisp’s SLIME <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Semantic-indentation.html">has been using this approach</a> for a very long time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to specify the right indentation with <a href="https://docs.cider.mx/cider/indent_spec.html">metadata</a></li>
  <li>All popular Clojure editors and formatters that exist today are supporting “semantic indentation” pretty well, so clearly it’s not a big obstacle for tooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general I’ve always found it dangerous that a lot of the reasoning
around code style in recent years has been centered around how easy it is to enforce
certain style automatically.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  I’ve experienced this first-hand both as
an editor of several code style guides, and as the author of a <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">fairly
popular Ruby lint/formatter tool</a>.  Yeah,
lint tools and formatters are very important and they make our lives easier, but we should
never forget we’re writing code for humans to read and (only occasionally) for machines to
execute. It’d be really sad if we lost sight of that just to pursue the ultimate degree
of consistency.</p>

<p>And there’s also the meta topic of the code we write being some artistic expression of our inner self, but we should
probably disregard this argument in any professional context. I’ll mention, though, that due to the simplicity
of Clojure/Lisp we’re (un)fortunate to have way fewer stylistic decisions to make than developers working with
languages like Ruby, Java or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Before, I wrap up I want to elaborate a bit on the reasoning behind the (infamous) semantic rules for function arguments alignment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>While some people would argue that the rules are random or inconsistent, I believe that’s definitely not the case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the first example, the formatting is similar to the one in every Algol-like language where the name of the function stands out and the arguments are grouped together. Of course, in most Algol-like languages people are still arguing whether to align or not align their function/method arguments. That being said, the case for aligned has always been the case for improved readability.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Ruby (aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
            <span>baz</span><span>)</span>

<span># Ruby (indented &amp; aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
  <span>baz</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example is in Ruby, but it could have easily been in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the second example some people would question what they call “the 1-space indent”. That’s not really indentation at all, but rather standard alignment of list elements. Don’t forget the <code>()</code> are not some special invocation syntax, but plain old list literals, that are normally formatted like any other collection literal:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; list literal</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>;; vector literal</span><span>
</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>;; set literal</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I find the following fixed indentation a big weird:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Fixed Indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; list literals</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span>
  </span><span>5</span><span>
  </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, list literals are not very common in Clojure, that’s why it’s understandable
that for many people lists are nothing but an invocation syntax.</p>

<p>“Better Clojure Formatting” argued that the semantic formatting guidelines were not consistent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rule would be easy to automate if it didn’t have a huge list of exceptions. <code>let</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>defn</code> and many other forms simply don’t follow this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this assessment, as the guideline in question is strictly for forms without bodies (mostly regular function calls).
All of the cited exceptions are just regular cases of a different <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#body-indentation">rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, exceptions! E.g. <code>try</code> doesn’t follow it. Also, having a mix of one- and two-space indents was driving me mad when I was trying to follow those rules manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here. Obviously <code>try</code> is not part of the guideline in question and follows a different guideline, which is hardly an exception.</p>

<h2 id="wide-vs-narrow-formatting">Wide vs Narrow Formatting</h2>

<p>I’ve noticed that many people dislike semantic formatting, because
it’s too wide (in the sense of taking up horizontal space) for their
taste. A reader remarked he finds this wide formatting ugly, wasteful
of horizontal space, and prohibitive of descriptive (long) function
names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (wide)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
                     </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to understand that the comparison of wide vs narrow formatting has nothing to do with
semantic vs fixed. I think the confusion comes mostly from the fact that the semantic formatting is
often used in its wide version, although there’s a matching narrow version for everything.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (narrow)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>zero?</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>curr</span><span>
  </span><span>:else</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>nxt</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>cur…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>This blog has been online for about 10 hours. To put it more harshly: I’m a
nobody on the internet. Yet, when I generated my first visitor report with
<a href="https://goaccess.io/">goaccess</a>, I saw that the bot army has already started
attacking my server. A lot of suspicious-looking URLs have been requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/config/getuser?index=0</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
  <li><code>/api/jsonws/invoke</code></li>
  <li><code>/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json</code></li>
  <li><code>/index.php?s=/Index/\x5Cthink\x5Capp/invokefunction</code>
<code>&amp;function=call_user_func_array&amp;vars[0]=md5&amp;vars[1][]=HelloThinkPHP21</code></li>
  <li><code>/console/</code></li>
  <li><code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/readme.txt</code></li>
  <li><code>/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a small sample but it is obvious that they are trying to exploit
known vulnerabilities. These are absolutely harmless because this is a static
website but there was one request that caught my attention:</p>



<p>My static site doesn’t have a <code>.env</code> file but I work on a lot of projects that
have one. I of course know that exposing the <code>.env</code> file is a mistake – it
usually contains passwords, keys and other sensitive information and in a
production environment, these should be in environment variables – but it is
very scary to see that this is <em>among the first things</em> hackers try – because
it’s so easy to accidentally copy it into a public directory.</p>

<p>So please, everyone: <strong>protect your <code>.env</code>!</strong></p>

When I’m in analysis mode I try to understand what market, technical and social forces have lead to the status quo. To do this effectively, or at least to induce useful principles for later use, you have to believe that things are the way they are for good reasons. As soon as I put my innovator hat on however, I get all jazzed up and think “screw that! X would be so much better if Y”. I’ve learned over the last year that balancing these two perspectives is essential to an inventor.</p><p id="9c7d">This week I watched Bret Victor’s <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/" rel="noopener">Future of Programming</a> lecture from July 2013 and it compelled me to put these thoughts down on paper. During the lecture, Bret uses an overhead projector and pretends its 1973. He proudly presents the latest in programming research for the time and explains why it’d be really silly if we aren’t using them in 40 years. To Victor’s credit he remains in character the whole time as he satirically paints the ideal world we’ll soon enter — one the audience knows doesn’t really exist.</p><p id="cbac">The future Bret showed off included direct manipulations of the output (result) instead of the code, programming via constraints/goals, spatial (visual) programming paradigms, and massively parallel programming approaches. Declarative programming, functional programming, microservice architectures and WYSIWYG editors check some of those boxes, but not nearly at the level of their potential. All that being said, there’s no argument against real progress having been made the last 40 years, just not the progress many expected.</p><p id="f16a">So now I’ll put on my analysis hat and work through why the art of programming is so hard to advance beyond its current levels.</p><p id="a3f1">Many blame the lack of advancements on developers. We built shinny thing X, but developers are too arrogant, stubborn, busy, dismissive or all of the above to adopt it. I’ve even heard people accuse developers of selfishly protecting their future job prospects by trying to stifle the adoption of new programming mediums. Heck, I’ve said this before…</p><p id="f628">^ This is just wrong. In my experience developers are very rational beings. Their job is to find the most efficient way of solving problems every single day and if you create a tool that provides that they’ll be all over it. They’ll even volunteer their time to help you build it for free. If you move forward accepting that developers are mostly rational actors and have good reasons for adopting something / not adopting something you can learn a lot to inform future design.</p><p id="33a0">So I did that. I actually sat down with people over the last 3 months and asked them why they failed to adopt a variety of tools. I overwhelmingly got rational explanations to why switching to something new was irrational.</p><h2 id="99cb">Better Hammer Tradeoff</h2><p id="8f1e">Imagine you’re building a log cabin by hand with a bad, but usable hammer. When you’re 90% of the way finished a magical genie comes and offers you a better hammer. Great! But there’s a tradeoff: If you take the new shinny hammer, you have to start the house from scratch…oh and he turns back humanity to the stone age. You can get your new hammer, but you’ll have to do without bandsaws, your pickup truck, and yes, nails.</p><p id="3e8b">What’s the rational choice? Hint, it involves the old hammer.</p><p id="7f24">That parable emerged from summarizing all the interviews I conducted and highlights the frustrations developers have had with many of the new ‘solve all your problems’ tools they’ve tried. For context these tools fit into two categories: new programming languages including some flow &amp; graph based paradigms and no-code visual builders.</p><p id="6a39">There are two areas of value to consider when choosing a programming paradigm: the developer experience of the [language, tooling, GUI] and the strength of the ecosystem (what common problems have been solved already). Many of the new paradigms, while often built on sound principles, miss out on the massive body of work that already exists is language X. How do you weight these two areas when picking your paradigm? 30–70? 90–10? 1–99? Most people I spoke with rated the ecosystem as 2–3x more important than DX.</p><p id="9ab3">Tool-builders usually only focus on DX and [assume, hope, pray] that a community comes along and builds an ecosystem. This still can happens, but it was much much more common in the 90s than it is today. There are network effects in programming and a beautiful virtuous cycle quickly emerges among the most used tools. When a user shares functionality openly it makes paradigm more capable, which attracts new users, who continue to improve that paradigm. Boom! Node module for everything.</p><p id="0b6c">When you look at the languages that have really caught on recently, they tend to share one thing in common: they tap into an existing body of work. Look at TypeScript, the most popular language released after 2000, which interoperates with Javascript. Then there’s Swift, the second most popular language released after 2000. Just imagine where Swift would be today if it hadn’t been interoperable with Objective-C and the Cocoa legacy or if TypeScript’s ecosystem was a blue ocean from day one.</p><p id="272c">There are consequences for tool makers building an entirely new base abstraction, be it visual, text based or otherwise. If you choose not to interoperate with an existing ecosystem, you or your community will need to spend years coming up from the stone age to modernity. Programming is just learning to use a bunch of stacked abstractions. Even if you have an objectively better base abstraction, one that would have clearly won out over everything else had it been introduced in 1992, people will have few incentives to adopt it if there’s no ecosystem.</p><h2 id="749d">Sunk Cost…Sensibility</h2><p id="5881">Most people complete the phrase “Sunk cost _____” with “fallacy”. The classic economics thought experiment usually involves a couple staying at a concert they hate just because they paid face value for the tickets. An enlightened economist would, as the story goes, leave as soon as they became unhappy with the concert and reclaim a few precious hours. But if you had to pay $50k, $50M or $5B to leave the concert early, you’d probably stay. When the switching costs are that high, there’s good reason to stay and the largest employers of programmers in the world have enormous switching costs. This keeps mainstream programmers anchored to the status quo.</p><p id="2c6d">This is another completely rational choice developers make when sticking to the paradigms they know. The combined costs of hiring new people, training, rewriting the code, and the opportunity cost of choosing these actions over improving your product almost always outweigh the benefits of making the change. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" rel="noopener">Joel has a classic article about code rewrites that expands on this more.</a></p><p id="ccc1">Young companies without much in the way of legacy or those with no other choice have the luxury of picking new paradigms, but few of these companies end up becoming incumbents. Those who do make it are the kingmakers. Both Facebook and Twitter were first built on technologies that were inadequate for their eventual scale (PHP and Ruby). Facebook became so attached to PHP that they enhanced the language to suit their needs with Hack and other tools. Similarly, Twitter switched over to Scala which one could argue is a key reason for Scala’s mainstream success.</p><h2 id="a2d4">Solving the Least Important Problems</h2><p id="513f">Tool makers must strike a balance between learnability and productivity. A visual programming environment like MIT’s <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> is incredibly learnable. I’ve seen 4-5 year old kids build games with it after just a few hours. The drag/drop interface and shape based constraints are really easy to learn and prevent Scratch from ever being in a broken state. This is great for kids and individuals trying to learn programming.</p><p id="bb8d">The same things that make Scratch easy to learn also make it an unproductive environment for more serious programmers. For a professional, programming with drag and drop is way slower than keying in code — that’s just a fact.</p><p id="cad2">These tradeoffs must be considered whenever building a new tool. If you build something super learnable that is not productive you’ll get a lot of praise, but little follow through. If you build something that’s too difficult to learn, but very productive you’ll turn a lot of people off. To reach mainstream programmers you need to make something that is both learnable and productive.</p><p id="5100">I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.</p><p id="742f">Truth is, every tool you have ever used is flawed and every new tool will also be flawed. Humans subconsciously come up with ways to cope with their tools so they can keep themselves focussed on the bigger conceptual issues. That isn’t going to change anytime soon. If professionals already have habits in place to cope with things that have been made easier/more learnable by new tooling, those new tools do not have much value to them. It’s like offering a 40 year old who’s been driving manual her whole life an automatic car — yeah that’s great, but it’s not needed and she certainly won’t pay a premium for it to be included.</p><h2 id="6e7a">Things Have Been Getting Better</h2><p id="10b2">No good analysis fails to include a few words from the Advocatus Diaboli.</p><p id="e04a">Things have been getting better.

December 6, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Note: the ideas in this post have already been covered numerous times in the past. One article that has greatly influenced my perspective over the years is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinley's Choose Boring Technology</a>. Below I'll explore the topic from my own experience, and how I ended up using Kubernetes for a recent project.</p><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring is less surprising</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>Boring is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit the problem at hand better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Exploit vs explore</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware it can be overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it works well for me, and I have been running production workloads with it for several years already. Please do not just blindly follow my path. Use what you already know best.</p><p>Kubernetes allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable debugging issues with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. It has also been around several years, there's lots of documentation, and a huge helpful community who can help. It'd argue that there's more documentation available than for any home-grown deployment system, or even EC2/Lambda/DigitalOcean for that matter.</p><p>As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><h2>Let complexity come over time</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 6, 2020 | https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-06</span>
<p>Despite what I may have said in an earlier post, it's not <em>all</em> that nice to code directly in wat.
So I've started work on a compiler. A very thin compiler. The language should feel very similar to our, beloved, <code>wat</code>, but save us from
typing all those <code>i32.const, local.get</code>.
</p>
<p>Some points up front:
</p>
<ul><li>
the compiler targets <code>WAT</code> (not <code>WASM</code>). This means using <code>WABT::wat2wasm</code>.
</li><li>
not self hosting <span>come on people, I don't even have malloc to play with yet, let alone a buggy, poorly implemented, partial copy of common lisp.</span>
</li><li>
the compiler is written in common lisp (specifically, sbcl). <span>hereinafter CL</span>.
</li><li>
syntax checking is state-of-the-art and errors are output in a readable format (i.e. you will get a cryptic <code>sbcl</code> debug trace if you make the
slightest mistake).
</li><li>
why <strong>sugar</strong>? It was either that or <code>watson, watsup, watsamatta, watulookin</code>. <span>Also cos it's just syntactical sugar, get it?</span>
</li><li>
internet searches are to be done using <code>sugarlang</code> <span>or sugarland if you prefer</span>.
</li><li>
there is no manual; not even mul/div or all the relation operators (e.g. &lt;=) are written yet!
</li><li>
the compiler output is not a standalone executable but a <code>wasm</code> file. The <em>best</em> standalone wasm runtime I've found so far is <code>wasm-interp</code>.
Please don't say node.js. You can say <code>v8</code>, maybe.
</li></ul>
<blockquote><strong>node.js/npm</strong><br>That feeling when ...<br>People say <em>Minimalist System</em><br>Then say "just use npm install ..."<br></blockquote><h2> sugar example</h2>
<p>Here is the <code>malloc.wat</code> example from the previous blog post on webasm re-written in <code>sugar</code>.
It's quite a bit more concise and convenient than the original raw <code>wat</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>(previous post on <code>wat</code>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html">/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html</a>
)
</p>
<pre>; malloc.sugar - sugar example code
(memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
(import "console" "log" (func js_log (i i32)))
(global memend i32 #x1000)
(global sbrk (mut i32) 0)
; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
(defun (export "malloc") (len i32) :result i32
  (locals (i32 (newbrk (+ sbrk len)) (mem sbrk)))
  (if (&gt;= newbrk memend) (return 0))
  (set sbrk newbrk)
  mem)
; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
(defun (export dump_range) (start i32 len i32)
  (locals (i32 i (end (+ start len))))
  (for (i start end)
    (js_log (get.u8* i))))
</pre>
<p>And this is what you would have written if you were coding directly in <code>wat</code>.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1)))))
</pre>
<h2> using sugar</h2>
<p>Write a <code>your-source.sugar</code> source file in your favorite text editor. Then run <code>sugar</code> on it to produce <code>your-source.wat</code>
</p>
<p>This is how I use sugar (with a makefile for calling sugar, then wat2wasm):
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.mk">/src/sugar.mk</a>
</p>
<pre>$ mk malloc.wasm
./sugar malloc.sugar &gt;malloc.wat
summary: globals:2 functions:3 macros:2
wat2wasm malloc.wat
</pre>
<p>(see below for installing common lisp)
</p>
<h2> compiler</h2>
<p>The compiler is very small and may be interesting to read, for that reason.
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</p>
<p>It includes a macro system, which I have used to implement <code>inc</code> and <code>for</code> but it's not yet available for use from sugar
itself. <span>Also the full CL defmacro/destructuring-bind lambda list syntax is non trivial to replicate; not to mention backquote.</span>
</p>
<h3> compiler structure</h3>
<p>Here is the overall compiler structure
</p>
<pre>loop:
  read a form [from source file]
  (compile form) =&gt; stdout
compile form:
  integer =&gt; (i32.const int)
  symbol =&gt; (local/global.get varname) [check in environment/scope]
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    if (is-macro? form)
      (compile (expand-macro form))
    else:
      is-special? form =&gt; (compile-special form) [defun/import/export/global/set...]
      is-function? =&gt;
        for all args (compile arg)
        call func with args
      otherwise =&gt; error undefined function
</pre>
<h3> common lisp?</h3>
<p>Too many brackets?
</p><blockquote>Rule 1: There are no brackets, only indentation.<br>Rule 0: We suffer the brackets cos it gives us defmacro and that's worth a lot of suffering.<br></blockquote><p>Did you ever generate code? Did you think that was cool? You'll love common lisp. Try it for 2 weeks.
Money back guarantee if not satisfied.
</p>
<h3> value-if</h3>
<p>Lisp has value-IF i.e. you can use IF anywhere you use a value. That's like C's ternary but more powerful.
At first I thought WAT doesn't have it, but (if) has an optional
<code>(result type)</code> clause, like (func) so that it's branches
can return (type matched) values. So you can do clever things like this:
<span>note the (result i32) clause between if and condition.</span></p>
<pre>(set x
  (if (result i32) (&gt;= z limit)
    (comp-true-value y)
    (comp-false-value s 14 q)))
</pre>
<p><code>wat (select)</code> is like the C ternary operator although it can have blocks/statement sequences inside.</p><p>select v if: select has all 3 clauses always evaluated while (if) has only the conditional and the chosen branch evaluated. The other
(if) branch is not evaluated.
</p>
<h2> future directions</h2>
<h3> user accessible macros (defmacro)</h3>
<p>Implement (defmacro ...) for sugar.
</p>
<h3> shortcut and/or</h3>
<p>At the moment I only have the bitwise and/or operators '&amp;' and 'bor' and next on the list is having shortcutting logical <code>and/or</code> operators
like CL.
</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to have lisp-style <code>and/or</code> where the expression value is
returned rather than just 0 or 1. Also standalone <code>and/or</code> so we can have things like
</p>
<pre>(and (file-existsp fname) (process-file fname))
(or (setup-completep) (error setup-failed))
</pre>
<span>Shortcut <code>and/or</code> actually compile to nested (if) expressions.</span><h3> missing operators/functions</h3>
<p>A whole slew of function counterparts for other types (i64,f32,f64) are missing. The compiler cannot type-infer which one (see below)
so these would have explicit names like <code>+f64, set.f64</code> etc.
</p>
<p>There are many other relops missing etc. They are fairly trivial to add.
</p>
<h3> arrays</h3>
<p>Currently I'm using pointer <code>get*/set*</code> but I'd like to have <code>aref</code> and implicit index to pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>Some more loops. <code>while repeat</code> etc. The underlying <code>block, loop, br_if, br</code> are exposed so writing loops is possible.
It would only be the case of adding some more macros to enable:
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
</pre>
<p>Also <code>continue, break</code> would be nice.
</p>
<h3> structures / defstruct</h3>
<p>Some kind of struct might be nice to have. Even if all the fields had to be i32 initially i.e. just a vector with named,
instead of numbered, fields.
</p>
<h3> better syntax/semantic checking</h3>
<p>Even the current error messages drop you into the SBCL debugger, which can be a scary place - [<code>ctrl-d</code>] to exit.
</p>
<h3> type tracing</h3>
<p>Knowing the types of values would allow the compiler to check signatures of calls of user functions and builtins.
It would also allow me to infer the correct type for <code>set</code> rather than requiring <code>set.f32</code> etc.
</p>
<h3> LET</h3>
<p>Locals <em>must</em> be defined at the start of a function. This means implementing LET (scoped blocks with local variables) is not trivial.
The current, single-pass, compiler would need to become far more complex to first decide how many locals are required in a function,
then allocate them up-front and possibly rename them if there are clashes.
</p>
<h3> self hosting</h3>
<p>The <em>holy grail</em> of compiler writers is that they rewrite their compiler in their new language. Common Lisp is <em>so far</em> above
the level of <code>wat</code> that this would be a large undertaking. First I'd need to write malloc...
</p>
<h2> installing common lisp</h2>
<p>Setting up sugar/common lisp may be trivial or hard depending on how familiar with common lisp you are :)
</p>
<p>Installing common lisp (I use SBCL) is outside the scope of this post. (Tell me it's harder than npm ...)
</p>
<p>I refer you to [Zach Beane's]
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/</a>
</p>
<p>SBCL might even be in your package manager:
</p>
<pre>$ pacman -Ss sbcl
</pre>
<p><code>sugar</code> is run as a unix script. I've made a custom sbcl core since I prefer <code>iterate</code> over <code>loop</code>.
Here is a very brief explanation of how to make such a core, starting with <em>plain, vanilla</em> sbcl.
</p>
<pre>$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload '#:iterate)
* (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-iterate")
$ sudo mv sbcl-iterate /usr/share/sbcl/sbcl-iterate
</pre>
<h2> source</h2>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/malloc.sugar">/src/malloc.sugar</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</li></ul>
<h2> mistakes</h2>
<p>[2020-12-07] My original compiler structure had a macro expansion bug. I was misled since I was in a block where I had just checked that
(form) was a consp/list and I assumed this remained true inside that block.
However, I missed the fact that I am modifying the form inside the block, with (expand-macro).
It's possible (expand-macro) returns a non-list e.g. a symbol. Then my list assumptions break.
</p>
<pre>compile form:
  ...
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    while: (is-macro? form)
      form := (expand-macro form) &lt;---- bug: this can change form into a non-list
    is-special? form =&gt; ...
    is-function? =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>First I fixed this with an extra list check in is-macro and also in the is-special/is-function parts, and a recursive call to compile
for non-list forms.
</p>
<p>I later thought if I had used a functional approach and avoided the mutation, I would not have made this mistake. My visual hint
that I was dealing with a list would have remained true. It turns out the functional solution is even more elegant than the original
and doesn't have the bug (+1 to functional purists).
</p>
<p>The functional solution, doesn't loop, it recurses on compile. Then compile gets the chance to decide again
what type of form expand-macro returned (nested macros …</p></div>

December 6, 2020 | http://blog.vmsplice.net/2020/12/understanding-peer-to-peer-git-forges.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.vmsplice.net/2020/12/understanding-peer-to-peer-git-forges.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system and does not require a central server. Although repositories are usually published at a well-known location for convenient cloning and fetching of the latest changes, this is actually not necessary. Each clone can have the full commit history and evolve independently. Furthermore, code changes can be exchanged via email or other means. Finally, even the clone itself does not need to be made from a well-known domain that hosts a git repository (see <tt>git-bundle(1)</tt>).</p>

<p>Given that git itself is already fully decentralized one would think there is no further work to do. I came across the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> project and its somewhat psychedelic website. Besides having a website with a wild color scheme, the project aims to offer a social coding experiment or git forge functionality using a peer-to-peer network architecture. According to the <a href="https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle">documentation</a> the motivation seems to be that git's built-in functionality works but is not user-friendly enough to make it accessible. In particular, it lacks social coding features.</p>

<p>The goal is to add git forge features like project and developer discovery, issue trackers, wikis, etc. Additional, distinctly decentralized functionality, is also touched on involving Ethereum as a way to anchor project metadata, pay contributors, etc. Radicle is still in early development so these features are not yet implemented. Here is my take on the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">How it Works</a> documentation, which is a little confusing due to its early stage and some incomplete sentences or typos. I don't know whether my understanding actually corresponds to the Radicle implementation that exists today or its eventual vision, because I haven't studied the code or tried running the software. However, the ideas that the documentation has brought up are interesting and fruitful in their own right, so I wanted to share them and explain them in my own words in case you also find them worth exploring.</p>

<h2>The git data model</h2>
<p>Let's quickly review the git data model because it is important for understanding peer-to-peer git forges. A git repository contains a <tt>refs/</tt> subdirectory that provides a namespace for local branch heads (<tt>refs/heads/</tt>), local and remotely fetched tags (<tt>refs/tags/</tt>), and remotely fetched branches (<tt>refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/</tt>). Actually this namespace layout is just a convention for everyday git usage and it's possible to use the <tt>refs/</tt> namespace differently as we will see. The git client fetches refs from a remote according to a <i>refspec</i> rule that maps remote refs to local refs. This gives the client the power to fetch only certain refs from the server. The client can also put them in a different location in its local <tt>refs/</tt> directory than the server. For details, see the <tt>git-fetch(1)</tt> man page.</p>

<p>Refs files contain the commit hash of an <i>object</i> stored in the repository's object database. An object can be a commit, tree (directory), tag, or a blob (file). Branch refs point to the latest commit object. A commit object refers to a tree object that may refer to further tree objects for sub-directories and finally the blob objects that make up the files being stored. Note that a git repository supports <i>disjoint</i> branches that share no history. Perhaps the most well-known example of disjoint branches are the GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages features where these git forges publish static websites from the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/image files on a specific branch in the repository. That branch shares no version history with other branches and the directories/files typically have no similarity to the repository's main branch.</p>

<p>Now we have covered enough git specifics to talk about peer-to-peer git forges. If you want to learn more about how git objects are actually stored, check out my article on the <a href="http://blog.vmsplice.net/2016/05/git-internals-of-how-objects-are-stored.html">repository layout and pack files</a>.</p>

<h2>Identity and authority</h2>
<p>Normally a git repository has one or more owners who are allowed to push refs. No one else has permission to modify the refs namespace. What if we tried to share a single refs namespace with the whole world and everyone could push? There would be chaos due to naming conflicts and malicious users would delete or change other users' refs. So it seems like an unworkable idea unless there is some way to enforce structure on the global refs namespace.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer systems have solutions to these problems. First, a unique identity can be created by picking a random number with a sufficient number of bits so that the chance of collision is improbable. That unique identity can be used as a prefix in the global ref namespace to avoid accidental collisions. Second, there needs to be a way to prevent unauthorized users from modifying the part of the global namespace that is owned by other users.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> provides the primitive for achieving both these things. A public key or its hash can serve as the unique identifier that provides identity and prevents accidental collisions. Ownership can be enforced by verifying that changes to the global namespace are signed with the private key corresponding to the unique identity.</p>

<p>For example, we fetch the following refs from a peer:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
</pre>

<p>This is a simplified example based on the Radicle documentation. Here <tt>identity</tt> is the unique identity based on a public key. Remember no one else in the world has the same identity because the chance of generating the same public key is improbable. The <tt>heads/</tt> refs are normal git refs to commit objects - these are published branches. The <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref points to an git object that contains a list of commit hashes and a signature generated using the public key. The signature can be verified using the public key.</p>

<p>Next we need to <i>verify</i> these changes to check that they were created with the private key that is only known to the identity's owner. First, we check the signature on the object pointed to by the <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref. If the signature is not valid we reject these changes and do not store them in our local repository. Next, we look up each ref in <tt>heads/</tt> against the list in <tt>signed_refs</tt>. If a ref is missing from the list then we reject these refs and do not allow them into our local repository.</p>

<p>This scheme lends itself to peer-to-peer systems because the refs can be propagated (copied) between peers and verified at each step. The identity owner does not need to be present at each copy step since their cryptographic signature is all we need to be certain that they authorized these refs. So I can receive refs originally created by identity A from peer B and still be sure that peer B did not modify them since identity A's signature is intact.</p>

<p>Now we have a global refs namespace that is partitioned so that each identity is able to publish refs and peers can verify that these changes are authorized.</p>

<h2>Gossip</h2>
<p>It may not be clear yet that it's not necessary to clone the entire global namespace. In fact, it's possible that no single peer will ever have a full copy of the entire global namespace! That's because this is a distributed system. Peers only fetch refs that they care about from their peers. Peers fetch from each other and this forms a network. The network does not need to be fully connected and it's possible to have multiple clusters of peers running without full global connectivity.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the global namespace there are <i>seed</i> repositories. Seeds are a common concept in peer-to-peer systems. They provide an entry point for new peers to learn about and start participating with other peers. In BitTorrent this is called a "tracker" rather than a "seed".</p>

<p>According to the Radicle documentation it is possible to directly fetch from peers. This probably means a <tt>git-daemon(1)</tt> or <tt>git-http-backend(1)</tt> needs to be accessible on the public internet. Many peers will not have sufficient network connectivity due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> limitations. I guess Radicle does not expect every user to participate as a repository.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a <i>gossip</i> system for propagating refs through the network. Let's revisit the refs for an identity in the global namespace:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
  remotes/
    &lt;another-identity&gt;/
      heads/
        main
        foo
      metadata/
        signed_refs
      remotes/
        ...
</pre>

<p>We can publish identities that we track in <tt>remotes/</tt>. It's a recursive refs layout. This is how someone tracking our refs can find out about related identities and their refs.</p>

<p>Thanks to git's data model the commit, tree, and blob objects can be shared even though we duplicate refs published by another identity. Since git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable</a> object database the data is stored once even though multiple refs point to it.</p>

<p>Now we not only have a global namespace where anyone can publish git refs, but also ways to build a peer-to-peer network and propagate data throughout the network. It's important to note that data is only propagated if peers are interested in fetching it. Peers are not forced to store data that they are not interested in.</p>

<h2>How data is stored locally</h2>
<p>Let's bring the pieces together and show how the system stores data. The peer creates a local git repository called the <i>monorepo</i> for the purpose of storing portions of the global namespace. It fetches refs from seeds or direct peers to get started. Thanks to the <tt>remotes/</tt> refs it also learns about other refs on the network that it did not request directly.</p>

<p>This git repository is just a data store, it is not usable for normal git workflows. The conventional <tt>git branch</tt> and <tt>git tag</tt> commands would not work well with the global namespace layout and verification requirements. Instead we can clone a local file:/// repository from the monorepo that fetches a subset of the refs into the conventional git refs layout. The files can be shared because <tt>git-clone(1)</tt> supports hard links to local repositories. Thanks to <tt>githooks(5)</tt> and/or extensible <tt>git-push(1)</tt> remote helper support it's possible to generate the necessary global namespace …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
          
            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/6 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/6">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517400508447-f8dd518b86db?w=1226&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=edges" alt=""><div><section><p>We wrote about <a href="https://security.christmas/2019/21">"Safe travels for the road warrior"</a> last year. This year we offer one more trick, and expand our list for staying safe and secure on the road.</p>
<p>Watch out for shoulder surfers, and protect your equipment if you have to leave it in for example your hotel room.</p>
</section><article><section><p><em>PANDEMIC WARNING: Stay at home if you can. A virus has for the better part of 2020 attacked physical infrastructure (people). We have no patch or hotfix, so while that is being worked out, we advice you to travel as little as possible.</em> </p>
<h2>Shoulder surfers:</h2>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. A shoulder surfer is someone who is peaking over your shoulder to get information. We can spot people prone to this type of social engineering attack all the time. When people are visiting a cafee, are on public transport, or on air planes they will use their laptop for work stuff. And they don’t notice, or care if someone is looking.</p>
<p>To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/privacy-screen-protector-angle-2.jpg" alt="privacy screen protector"></p>
<p>Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QsbNjHu.png" alt="a neat menu bar"></p>
<p>rather than this abomination of a menu bar: </p>
<p><img src="https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1password1280.jpg" alt="an untidy and talkative menue bar"></p>
<p>The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it reveals many of your attack vector. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient? The bad guys already have tools for these applications.  </p>
<h2>Mikado security</h2>
<p>The other tip is to not leave your computer laying around. This may seem obvious, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.</p>
<p>If an adversary has physical access to your device, they can do all sort of damage. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/11/poker_pros_call_shenanigans_over_hotel_malware_infections/">A poker player had this happen to him</a>, where someone broke into his hotel room to install malware on his laptop. This is only one of the cases, but we suspect there are many more based on  the fact that hotel room locks are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bazy3Ew6D4">ridiculously insecure</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX-O4XuCW1Y">easy to bypass</a>.<br>
So to combat this problem, we have devised a nice little trick to help you stay safe if you have to leave your device behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5475/9350249910_6aeb4b5d85_h.jpg">
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ffftxm">Mikado</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kobakpontorg/">Balazs Koren</a>, on Flickr</p>
<p>Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others.</p>
<p>MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device.
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.</p>
<p>This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct. </p>

A big source of angst was the amount of “unknown traffic”, things which matched no patterns. Our sales team wanted this less. Our customers wanted it less. Our competitors had less. Why couldn’t we?</p><p>I used to answer this question as follows. “You know, I can put in one bad pattern, that mis-matches, a false positive. The amount of unknown will go down. Will that make it better? I can make 0% unknown right now.”. Interestingly, some would agree with the statement “sure, lets do that”. Some would say “don’t be ridiculous, I want 100% known, and 0% incorrect.”. I would answer the last question as “what if you made your own proprietary protocol, the license-plate protocol. You, and only you use it. The data in the stream is ciphered from your license plate. Would you expect a pattern for that?”. They would usually say no, I would then point out that 0% unknown as a false goal, the real goal was 0% incorrectly known and as much known as feasible. Still didn’t stop the competitor from using weak false positives to get to higher <code>known</code> amount.</p><p>Yesterday I received an email from the good people at Google. They are launching a new document leakage tool. It scans your shared documents for sensitive things (emails, medical, that sort of thing). Mine is below.

I spent time trying to figure out what the call to action was. Eventually I realised the call to action was to ignore: someone at Google has written a few bad regex. They’ve run them on my documents. They’ve shared the categories and counts, but not the links. Their false positive engine cost me time and adds nothing to the universe.</p><p>Sadly, I think there are people out there buying pattern engines for all sorts of things, and, pushing towards the false goal of 0% unknown. It must match, right? Wrong.</p></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

      <p>All is quiet at Greta Thunberg's home on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. On this day one year ago she was at sea, on a catamaran in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Now she has just come home from school. Labrador Roxy is asleep on the couch, and Moses, the golden retriever, has crashed out on the floor. A thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle is spread out over the kitchen table on which Greta lays edge pieces while waiting for Sir David to appear on the computer monitor.</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p><strong>This fall, she is the main character</strong> in Nathan Grossman's feature film Greta. He has recently released the film and the book A Life on our Planet.</p>
      <p>In the introduction to the film, Sir David says:</p>
      <p>”The natural world is disappearing. The evidence is all around us, it is happened in my lifetime. I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p>
      <p>The story starts in 1937, the year he turned 11.</p>
      <p>Then: Wilderness on 66 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 280 ppm.</p>
      <p>And now? Wilderness on 35 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 415 ppm.</p>
      <p>Just like climate change and the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/covid-19-pandemics-nature-scientists/">ongoing pandemic</a>, the loss of biodiversity is part of a major sustainability crisis caused by humans.</p>

      <p><strong>The computer pings</strong>, and Gretas kitchen is filled with a familiar voice coming from the speakers. A voice usually accompanied by pictures of vast savannas, colorful coral reefs and mighty animals cheerfully says:</p>
      <p>”Hello, Greta!”</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p>DN's Head of Culture Björn Wiman leads the conversation by link from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Björn Wiman: ”Sir David, how is life for you during the pandemic?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>David Attenborough:</strong> ”Well, it is not so bad. I am lucky to have a garden. It is not a big garden, but it is a garden, and it has a pond. I get food delivered once a week. And I have a lot to do: I can write here and I record, doing my voiceovers while watching the programs on a screen. So I have been pretty active... I have not actually left the house in eight and a half months, which is extraordinary. But I cannot complain.”</p>
      <p><strong>”Greta, I know that films and documentaries like the ones Sir David has made were what got you interested in this subject from the start.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Greta Thunberg:</strong> ”Yes, that is right. It was by watching documentaries and films that I was introduced to the climate crisis and the environmental crisis. That is how I learned and linked the facts to start with. It was a big eye-opener for me.”</p>

      <p><strong>”This conversation is about two parts of the same major crisis: Climate change and the mass extinction of other species on Earth. My impression is that the climate crisis sometimes takes up a disproportionate amount of space and that too little attention is focused on the interaction between these two crises. Do you agree?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”These crises are interconnected. We cannot communicate one crisis without communicating the other. Unfortunately, the media today works in such a way that we want simple and click-friendly headlines. That can make it difficult to explain complex issues, and this is a very complicated issue. We need to connect the information: This is not one crisis, it is not two or three separate crises. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue.”</p>

      <p><strong>”Do you think, Greta, that there is too much focus on the ”nature side” of this issue – and too little on the consequences for human civilization and the future of humanity?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”No, I do not think there is too much focus on nature. I think there is too little focus on nature.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, that is right.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”There is too little focus on all aspects of this crisis.”</p>
        
  
  

      <p><strong>”Does that also apply to the ”solution side” of this problem? You sometimes hear ‘the solution can be found in new technological systems’ or ‘the solution is that we change our way of life’.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”There is not one single solution. There are a number of different solutions because there are a lot of problems. Fishing has a set of problems, carbon dioxide emissions have different problems, the way we treat agricultural land. The fuel and energy industries have their own challenges. So there is not just one miraculous action that allows us to say, ‘Right, bingo, there we have it! We have resolved the issue.’ It is not like that! There are millions of issues.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Exactly. Sometimes it feels like we are wasting the little time we have now by arguing about what solution is best. ‘We shouldn not be doing this because this is better.’ As if we had a choice! As if we can decide for ourselves what we need to do, and as if there is one magical solution that will fix everything. We need to get away from that narrative, we need to leave that idea behind us.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, I agree. And at the end of the day, you know, it is a big world. The only thing we can do – what you, Greta, are particularly good at – is to ensure that people around the world see what the problem is. We have to be persistent, and we have to make sure there is a large democratic multitude of voices saying 'do something, do something, do something'. We have to keep that choir alive, or those with power will not react. But even when they do react, it is extremely difficult to reach agreement on how we should treat the oceans or the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Yes. For a crisis as complex as this one, which we do not fully understand – for there will always be things we are unaware of – we must bring together all the experts. We have to deal with the crisis as a crisis and work together from there. We cannot expect to have all the answers delivered to us, for someone to say, ‘This is what we need to do. This is going to solve the problem.’ We have to find the answers along the way.”</p>

And veganism – you are a vegan, Greta – I mean: It has happened! So changes are happening, they are not sufficient, and they are not dramatic enough, but... We all move in our own circles, so it is hard to generalize. But in my circles I meet far more people who understand the problems now, far more people who do what they can in their own lives.”</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png" alt="" width="657" height="115" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-768x135.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-1024x180.png 1024w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></p>
<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

<span>DESCRIPTION</span>              
     <span>VisiData</span> is an easy-to-use multipurpose tool to explore, clean, edit, and restructure          
     data. Rows can be selected, filtered, and grouped; columns can be rearranged, trans-           
     formed, and derived via regex or Python expressions; and workflows can be saved, doc-          
     umented, and replayed.

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3qbPNSm">Bose Quietcontrol 30 Wireless Headphones</a> ($169)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3fVzzIh">Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700</a> ($339)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37qgsSN">BlueTooth ledger</a> ($118)</li>
  <li>Two backpacks. (2 x $100)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/an/pd/kzanpdzeno_6rkrjjgbrhbscbbs.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>One option could be to do an extensive check of all locks in the building after moving in. Another is to take all expensive belongings with me when I leave the house.
I will do it in the future, but it may decrease the level of fun from my vacations.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

<h3 id="ontology">Ontology:</h3>
<p>With the goal of providing multi-modal data to enhance autonomous off-road navigation, we defined an ontology of object and terrain classes, which largely derives from <a href="http://rugd.vision/">the RUGD dataset</a> but also includes unique terrain and object classes not present in RUGD. Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-metaphors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Metaphors are everywhere;&nbsp;in literature, visual arts, poetry, and films. Language, in a way, itself&nbsp;is a metaphor. But try to make one on the fly, and you will find out it is not easy. Creating a metaphor requires ingenuity and care. A small mistake can make a metaphor clumsy. So how does one write a good metaphor?&nbsp;Let’s find out.</p><h2>Why Metaphors are Important</h2><p>Metaphors make us understand things better. When feelings are involved or when something happens which has no proper words in our vocabulary, we need something to communicate our experience. Metaphors come in handy in such situations. For example, author F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to describe good writing. He could simply say that good writing was hard or good writing is very difficult. But he chose to say it like this:</p><p><em>All good writing is swimming underwater and holding your breath.</em></p><p>The metaphor&nbsp;“swimming underwater while holding breath” opens a door for us into the experience of Fitzgerald as a writer. That was a very difficult thing to convey in plain words. A whole paragraph might have not sufficed. But here a metaphor has conveyed the meaning completely in a single sentence. Metaphors help us convey meaning by using similarities in different objects and experiences. They relate things with one another and the result is a new understanding of a certain thing. All good poetry and literature do this to create new meanings. Another example is this beautiful metaphor by Shakespeare:</p><blockquote><p>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances;<br>And one man in his time plays many parts.</p><p><em>As You Like It</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Metaphors help us use all of our senses in reading a sentence. They make the experience of language more immersive. Take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote><p>Time has not stood still. It has washed over me, washed me away as if I'm nothing more than a woman of sand, left by a careless child too near the water.</p><p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Margaret Atwood</p></blockquote><p>The writer could simply have said that time has changed me. But the use of sand and water as metaphors has given the whole experience a life of its own. We can hear in our minds the sound of waves when reading the sentence. We can imagine a woman of sand. Therefore, metaphors give a deeper meaning to our words. They can convey meanings for which sometimes whole pages are necessary and sometimes even a book is not enough.</p><blockquote><p>I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God.</p><p>Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>In this small sentence, Mother Teresa has conveyed the whole of her faith. We can get a glimpse of her intimate relationship with God. We can sense her metaphysical experience. This was not possible without the use of a metaphor.</p><p>Along with that, plain words can be boring for our minds. Our minds hate repetitiveness and mundaneness and loves newness and ingenuity. Metaphors give us this freshness and livens ordinary language. Language becomes more interesting.</p><blockquote><p>She herself is a haunted house. She does not possess herself; her ancestors sometimes come and peer out of the windows of her eyes and that is very frightening.</p><p><em>The Bloody Chamber, </em>Angela Carter</p></blockquote><p>Simply saying that there is an eerie feeling attached to her the writer could have told us about the character but using a metaphor makes it more interesting and memorable. In addition to that, Metaphors add vagueness and abstractedness to our language. This gives readers free rein to make their own interpretations.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a bluebird in my heart that<br></em><em>wants</em><em> to get out<br></em><em>but</em><em> I'm too tough for him,<br></em><em>I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br></em><em>to</em><em> let anybody see<br></em><em>you</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>Bluebird</em>, Charles Bukowski</p></blockquote><p>Nobody has a clear idea of what the bluebird is in this poem and so people make their interpretations. Metaphors give us the freedom to read works in the context of our own Worldview.</p><h2>How to Write Good Metaphors?</h2><p>First of all, start thinking about the thing or experience you want to express. Concentrate on the idea and think about it deeply. Understand it thoroughly. How do you feel about the whole idea?</p><p>For example, you want to describe the scene of someone waking up for the first time to the sound of the coming train. Lean into the experience of someone peacefully sleeping in a cozy room under blankets in a comfy bed. Now imagine a train passing over with an ear-shattering sound. What will the character feel like? Imagine it. Now can you compare it to something else that is similar in its sudden experience?</p><p>For me, the scene of a car suddenly breaking through the bedroom wall is similar so I would construct my metaphor around that imagery.</p><p><em>He woke up and thought a car had crashed in his bedroom. Everything was moving. His heart was pumping. "Oh! It's the train!" he let out a sigh and shook his head.</em></p><p>Secondly, try using original metaphors in your writing or ones that are rare. Commonly used metaphors are dead in a sense. Some dead metaphors are given here as an example:</p><ul><li>It's raining cats and dogs.</li><li>I'm visiting an old flame.</li><li>He's loose cannon.</li><li>She found herself behind the eight balls.</li><li>He drives me up a wall.</li><li>She saw the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><li>Ticking time bomb</li><li>Tip of the iceberg</li><li>Slippery slope</li><li>Going the extra mile</li><li>Early bird</li><li>Icy personality</li><li>Turning in one's grave</li><li>About to explode (from anger)</li></ul><p>Here are some more complex examples of metaphors. Read them carefully so you can get an idea of how a metaphor works.</p><p><em>1. Books are the mirrors of the soul.</em></p><p>Virginia Woolf describes here the connection between an author and his/her books. Books describe the inner thoughts of the author's mind. That is an experience similar to seeing one's soul. A mirror reflects everything that is in front of it. It does not lie. This small sentence combines these two concepts perfectly to convey a beautiful meaning.</p><p>2. <em>"</em><em>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"</em></p><p>Shakespeare is trying to describe the feeling of love that Romeo had for Juliet. The sun is a classic metaphor used in ancient literature to describe a lover.</p><p>3. <em>The parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is </em><em>something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick </em><em>it away.</em></p><p>The author here depicts the anger Matilda's parents felt for their child using “a scab on skin”. A person puts up with it because it's painful and messy to remove it before time.</p><p>4. <em>"O Lord, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You, our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand."</em></p><p>In this verse of the Bible, the feeling of helplessness and the might of the All-Mighty God is described. Helplessness is compared with the inertness of the clay. And the potter's hands are the workings of God.</p><p>5. <em>Alas,</em><em> and yet what are you, my written and painted thoughts! It is not long ago that you were still so many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>, young, and malicious, so full of thorns and hidden spices you made me sneeze and laugh and now? You </em><em>have already taken off your novelty and some of you, I fear, are on the point of becoming truths: they already look so immortal, so pathetically righteous, so boring! And has it ever been otherwise? For what things do we write and paint, we mandarins with </em><em>Chinese brushes, we immortalizers of things which let themselves </em><em>be</em><em> written, what alone are we capable of painting? Alas, only that which is about to wither and is beginning to lose its fragrance! Alas, only storms departing exhausted and feelings grown old and yellow! Alas, only birds strayed and grown weary in flight </em><em>who</em><em> now let themselves be caught in the hand in our hand! We immortalize that which cannot live and fly much longer, weary and mellow things alone! And it is only your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have the </em><em>colours</em><em>, many </em><em>colours</em><em> perhaps, many many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>tendernesses</em><em> and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds: but no one will divine from these how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you my old beloved wicked thoughts!</em></p><p>Here Nietzsche is describing the thoughts in the human mind which are immortal, ever-changing with infinite possibilities, and how impossible it is to define them truly words.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Good metaphors spice up any piece of art, be it a painting or a poem or a novel. Some writers use whole characters as forms of metaphors, others use symbolism. Learning to write a good metaphor can be a difference between a good piece and a great piece.

<h3><a name="openvms"></a>The OpenVMS ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Two companies are currently supporting OpenVMS (but this is about to 
	change)<ul>
		<li>In 2014, HP transferred the rights to develop/support OpenVMS to VSI 
		(<a href="https://www.vmssoftware.com/">VMS Software Inc</a>)</li>
		<li>In 2015, HP split into two companies: HP (most desktop products) and 
		HPE (enterprise)</li>
		<li>HPE continued to support OpenVMS software contracts sold to HP customers 
		before 2015 (they also sold/supported VSI products)</li>
		<li>Early in 2019, HPE removed most OpenVMS stuff (documentation as well 
		as software) from their website including CSWS-2.2-1 (<a href="http://neilrieck.net/docs/openvms_notes_apache.html">Compaq Secure Web Services</a>) 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.0.63</span><ul>
			<li>For example, this link:
			<a href="http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html">http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/csws.html</a> 
		previously provided both software-downloads and product documentation 
		but now diverts you to this common landing page:
			<a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us">https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=a00058693en_us</a> 
		(in fact, all HPE OpenVMS software links now drop you here)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you have an OpenVMS support contract with HPE, then you will be 
		able to request the latest version of file MOD_SSL (an Apache module for 
		CSWS) which is based upon OpenSSL-1.0L but does not implement TLSv1.3<ul>
			<li>HPE has announced the end of all OpenVMS support by the end of 2020.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Businesses requiring <strong>CSWS/Apache on OpenVMS</strong> should immediately 
	move their support contracts over to VSI where you will have access to a new version of CSWS 
	based upon <span>Apache 2.4.12</span><ul>
			<li><span>caveat:</span> you may be required to update your OS to OpenVMS-8.4-2 so do not wait until the last minute</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For companies and/or hobbyists financially unable to move to VMS 
	Software Inc., your the only remaining option is to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD HTTPd 
	(the high quality web server from down-under) which is not based upon 
	Apache.<ul>
		<li>WASD already supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3</li>
		<li>"I think" support agreements may be available</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This web-page will document my efforts to replace CSWS/Apache with WASD 
	HTTPd on a sacrificial laboratory system (we employ a lot of CGI including one SOAP-based 
	feed)</li>

<h2><a name="intro2"></a>Introduction to WASD HTTPd</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD</a> HTTPd - is a very high quality free

		<li>excerpt from page-13 of the book <strong>OpenVMS with Apache, OSU, and WASD</strong>
		<p>
				The idea with WASD was to be a really good VMS-only server: Mark Daniel says, "I 
suffered a bit of a VMS cringe when amongst my UNIX colleagues (VMS was perceived 
to be a bit slow and cumbersome), so I have also endeavored to make WASD as fast 
and efficient as I could, avoiding C run-time library and even RMS code layers 
where it was feasible and worth it. I also wanted a similarly tight scripting 
environment and have spent a lot of time honing this aspect"</p>

		<li><span>Trivia:</span> <strong>WASD</strong> = "Wide Area 
		Surveillance Division". WASD was previously known as <strong>HFRD</strong> 
		(High Frequency Radar Division) of Australia's Defense, Science and 
		Technology Organization</li>

<div>
	<p><strong><a id="executive"></a>Executive Summary</strong>:

		have worked on to date.<br>I am currently supporting web servers on these

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>



<h3><span id="Ambient_display_Android_wins"></span>Ambient display: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Ambient display. This Pixel 4 XL is not active. It’s basically in sleep mode. It uses minimal power to give me useful information on its OLED screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>



<h3><span id="Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins"></span>Treating me like an adult: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>

<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple, cheap data pipeline to pull small amounts of data from a stable API and store it in a cloud storage, then <code>serverless functions</code> are a good choice. This post aims to answer questions like the ones shown below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My company does not have the budget to purchase a tool like <code>fivetran</code>, What should I use to pull data from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I really need an orchestration tool like Airflow for one simple data pull from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the post we cover what a <code>serverless</code> function can and cannot do, what its pros and cons are and walk through a simple API data pull project.</p>

<p>Chances are that you have heard of the term <code>serverless</code>. The term <code>serverless</code> may be misleading. In fact, there is a server on which your code will be running. <code>Serverless</code> refers to the fact that you do not have to manage any servers, but just the code. We will use <code>AWS Lambda</code> for this simple project. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?c=ser&amp;sec=srv"><code>AWS Lambda</code></a> can be used to run a function without having to provision and maintain a server.</p>
<p>You write a function and deploy it to AWS Lambda. There you can set the function to run based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understanding-the-different-ways-to-invoke-lambda-functions/">external triggers</a>. The lambda function will execute the logic and end. Note that you will have a limited time (current max execution time for lambda code execution is 15min) for your code logic to complete. There is also a limit on the memory size(current max is at 3.008GB). In this post we will</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the lambda function.</li>
<li>Download data from a dummy API to local file system.</li>
<li>Copy the downloaded files to AWS S3.</li>
<li>Stop the lambda function.</li>
<li>The lambda function will be scheduled to run every 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.startdataengineering.com/images/pull-data-from-API-using-lambda-s3/api_data_pull.png" alt="Simple API Data Pull"></p>

<p>Let’s assume you work for a company that wants to pull some data from an API that you have access to and assess the quality of that data. Your responsibility is to pull this data and make it available via cloud storage for other systems to consume and assess quality. Let’s assume that this is your first and only data pull(for now). There is not enough time/ money to set up/buy a data orchestration tool. This project is to validate the value that this data may provide, based on which your company can choose to either continue paying for this data or not.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Account</a></li>
<li>AWS CLI <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">installed</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configured</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that our API has the following documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>API endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</code> to get user post data.</li>
<li>Query parameters: The data returned from the API is sorted by user_id. Using <code>start_user_id</code> and <code>end_user_id</code> we can query for a range of data based on user ids.</li>
<li>API metadata endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/number_of_users</code>, will return the total number of user posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GET endpoint will return a list of JSON with the format</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"userId"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"some title here"</span>,
    <span>"body"</span>: <span>"some test here"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>
<p>When pulling a “lot” of data from an API, it is general best practice to make multiple requests to pull data in chunks. The definition of a lot of data depends on the amount of data being pulled and the API stability. Based on the <code>API Documentation</code> above, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li>Split the number into N number of calls, depending on a predefined <code>CHUNK</code> size. Which is the amount of data you want to pull per API call.</li>
<li>Make the API call, pull the data and write it to a local disk storage. You can also store in memory if the data size is sufficiently small.</li>
<li>Some APIs may fail due to network or other issues, add a retry parameter to account for this. In reality this will depend on the stability of the API and the network.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the size of data and the allocated lambda memory, it may be more efficient to keep data in memory instead of writing to disk and then uploading to S3.</p>
<p>Lets create a folder called <code>dataPull</code> in your project directory and within it a python script called <code>lambda_function.py</code>, starting with the content below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">CHUNK_SIZE <span>=</span> <span>10000</span>  <span># determined based on API, memory constraints, experimentation</span>

        data <span>=</span> get_data(i, i <span>+</span> CHUNK_SIZE)
        write_to_local(data, i <span>//</span> CHUNK_SIZE)
</code></pre></div><p>In the above code snippet, we have the functions</p>
<ol>
<li><code>get_num_records</code> to simulate the GET call to your API to get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li><code>download_data</code> to make multiple calls to the API and only accessing 10,000 data records per API data pull. This 10,000 is defined as a global variable <code>CHUNK_SIZE</code>. In your project you will need to determine what this size is depending on API stability, memory constraints, network connection and general best practice size for that API.</li>
<li><code>parse_data</code> to convert the json data into a row format string, which gets written to a local file.</li>
<li><code>write_to_local</code> to write the downloaded chunk of data into the local file system. In our case if we have 100,000 records we will generate 10 files name <code>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</code> with the data for user ids <code>0-10000, 10000-20000,...90000-100000</code> correspondingly. Note the local file system location <code>/tmp</code> will only be available for the duration of a single run of your function.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>
<p>In the above snippet, since we are downloading chunks independently we can also make it concurrent using python’s <code>asyncio</code> library. If you are using concurrency be very aware of the number of open connections/ file handlers, etc. You can also manage concurrency at the lambda function level as shown <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_console">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note some API may not provide the exact number of records, instead you will have to query until no more data is available (usually using some sort of <code>search_after</code> query parameter). In such cases concurrency will be difficult to achieve since you will need the output from the previous call to make the next API call. An example of this is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-search-after.html"><code>ElasticSearch's</code> search_after</a>. There is also the <code>from, size</code> type API endpoints which requires the size of data to pull and an id from which to start pulling data as query parameters to the API call.</p>

<p>Since lambda functions are temporary, so are their local storage. We need to make sure our locally stored data (at <code>/tmp</code>) gets stored in a persistent storage system such as <code>AWS S3</code>. Add the below code to <code>lambda_function.py</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Not interested in the back story? </strong>Jump ahead to <a href="#introducing-localizer">Introducing Localizer</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Before we get into the details of what localizer is and how it came to be, it's crucial that we look at what developer environments were and the motivations behind the ones I create.</p><p>Ever since I wrote my first ever <a href="https://github.com/staymarta/dev">developer environment</a> for the now-defunct <a href="https://github.com/staymarta">StayMarta</a>, I've always focused on one thing: ease of use. For a docker-compose based development environment, this was a relatively simple task. Create Docker containers, write a compose file, declare ports, and they'd be available on my local machine. It was as simple as <code>docker-compose up</code>. While this approach didn't necessarily match what production looked like, it was really the best option available for containers at the time. Options that exist now, such as Kubernetes, weren't available, which rendered <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">equality between production and development a work-in-progress dream</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, at my first larger-scale startup, <a href="https://azuqua.com/">Azuqua</a>, I had a chance to reimagine what a developer environment looked like under a whole new set of constraints. While Docker Compose works for small teams, it falls apart when you map it to production systems. At the time, our production system was based on Chef. Docker Compose doesn't map to Ruby-based Chef configuration files. When I joined Azuqua, the pain around having separate tooling for infrastructure had become incredibly clear. It wasn't sustainable to have an entire team; write the configuration for our services, communicate with developers why infrastructure can't infinitely scale without good software design, and do it all without blame or single points of failure. Fundamentally this is why I take issue with DevOps teams and prefer promoting the <a href="https://sre.google/">Google SRE Model</a> instead. While at Azuqua, we started a transition to an SRE model and used Kubernetes as a way to help facilitate that.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/kind-1.png" alt="KinD Logo"></figure><p>While at Azuqua, I identified the need to run Kubernetes to ease cloud resources' scalability and improve the developer experience. At the same time, this <strong>drastically decreased the developer experience</strong>. While this may seem contradictory at first, it's essential to consider the multiple ways that developer experience presents itself. While at first, it may seem like it's just tooling to test/write code, it's a combination of testing code, writing code, and deploying that code. With the Docker Compose environment at StayMarta, we made the test/build cycle incredibly simple but shifted the deploy aspects onto a bespoke team, the DevOps model. That approach works for small teams, but as you grow, this quickly doesn't scale. If you can't deploy code efficiently, the developer experience is frustrating and promptly turns to an unhealthy relationship with the team responsible for that cycle.</p><p>Going back to how Kubernetes <em>improved the developer experience</em>, which I assure you it does. The benefit to Kubernetes was that it brought a control plane into the mix and focused on being just a container orchestrator. The DSL it does have is highly specific to orchestrating containers and making them work. The control-plane allows self-healing and building tooling to enable all different types of use-cases consistently. While it lacks abstractions, it brings something to developers they've never had before, the ability to deploy code reproducibly. With the introduction of <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a>, <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a>, and others, you could now run the same stack you run in production, but locally.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly deploy helps both deployment confidence and the amount of time needed to get from nothing to running in production. However, it's not without its faults. Whenever you start moving deployment tooling onto developers, you've decreased the developer experience. It's unavoidable because you're introducing net new materials, DSLs, and more for the developers to learn. While <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> are great projects, they all suffer from needing developers to understand how to work with Kubernetes. You need to be able to build a Docker image, push the docker image into the cluster, delete the application pod, verify if it's even using the correct tag, wait for Kubernetes to recreate the container, and make sure you've configured an ingress route to access it outside of your cluster or use <code>kubectl port-forward</code> to access it. The second that breaks, you're now required to dig into why service connectivity isn't working, why your Docker image isn't in the <code>containerd</code> cache, or other not so easily solved areas. While to someone who's worked with Kubernetes for years now, this isn't very difficult, this is hardly achieving the "ease of use" goal I have.</p><p>Solving these problems is not easy. Debugging Kubernetes is difficult and requires knowledge that can only be solved with education, more tooling, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, these are not cheap. Education is hard to do correctly and tends to result in lots of time writing quickly out of date material that is hard to maintain. While at Azuqua, we encountered this same problem. Very few engineers wanted to learn Kubernetes or invest time in the technology around it. We decided to go back to the basics and focus on a tooling based approach. How do we get the same developer experience level, at a minimum, of Docker Compose with Kubernetes? Our answer ended up being a tool called <a href="https://telepresence.io/">Telepresence</a>. Telepresence describes itself as:</p><blockquote>[...] an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster.<p><a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview</a></p></blockquote><p>It seemed perfect, a tool that enabled your local machine to act as if it were running in Kubernetes and allow your services to be targeted from inside of Kubernetes. We rolled it out at Azuqua after initial tests showed it worked well, and we went with it. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p><p>While Telepresence solved the problem of communicating with our local Kubernetes cluster, it spectacularly failed at letting services inside the cluster talk to our local services. When it worked, it worked amazingly, but nine times out of ten, it'd fail in a magnitude of ways. Whether that's failing to clean up after random crashing or slowly taking down the computer's internet connection, it generally wouldn't work. Luckily for us at Azuqua, we had a pretty well-defined system for service discovery and few services that needed to talk to one another directly. The few that needed that could just run outside of the cluster. That allowed us to accept those pains and be successful with Telepresence. To be clear, this is not a hit on Telepresence. It worked very well for us at Azuqua, but it's not a complete solution.</p><p>When I started developing a new development environment for <a href="https://outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, I again tried to use Telepresence as the solution to bridge the gap between our local cluster and our local machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work. We did not have a well-defined service discovery mechanism to work around the bugs, we had a much larger engineering team, and almost all services needed to talk to each other. We found more and more edge cases with Telepresence, and our developer experience was suffering. Our NPS score for our developer environment was at a low of -26, just because of Telepresence!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="Chart showing the NPS spread"><figcaption>For comparison, a good NPS is generally +30...&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty clear that Telepresence was not going to solve our use-cases. It was time to look into alternatives.</p><p>Telepresence was interesting since it used a VPN to give you access to your resources. However, it also required a hack DNS injector component, which tended to be the primary source of network problems. There weren't many projects out there that seemed to solve this, but one interesting one was <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a>. If you're not aware of Kubernetes port-forwarding, there is a command that allows you to bring down a set of ports for a given service and have them be available on your local machine via <code>kubectl port-forward</code>. Think of the <code>-p</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>, but for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, this didn't support FQDNs (<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>), statefulsets, or all namespaces automatically. It also didn't support reverse tunneling. I wanted to keep the spirit of Telepresence by continuing to be a one-stop tool. Aside from <code>kubefwd</code>, there were seemingly no tools that could do this. Reverse tunneling into Kubernetes alone seemed to be an unsolved problem. To fill that gap, I decided to write <code>localizer</code>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredallard/localizer">Localizer</a> is a rewrite of Telepresence in Golang, but without the complex surface area. Its goal is to be a simple, no-frills development tool for application developers using Kubernetes. It does this by being easy to use, self-explanatory, and easy to debug. Localizer only supports what Kubernetes networking does, and acts as a daemon. This is most useful when trying to expose multiple services, developers generally had to have many terminal windows to run Telepresence or other reverse tunnel solutions. Localizer moves away from that by having all commands send a gRPC message to the daemon. More on that later. At the core of Localizer is three commands.</p><h2 id="default-creating-tunnels">Default: Creating Tunnels</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-04-at-1.28.31-PM-1.png" alt="Output from running the localizer daemon"><figcaption>Running <code>localizer</code> on my home Kubernetes Cluster (it's not limited to just local developer environments)</figcaption></figure><p>When you run <code>localizer</code> without any arguments, it automatically creates port-forwards for all Kubernetes Services (this is important), a loopback-interface powered IP address, and adds them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Out of the box, this allows code to communicate with Kubernetes services despite being outside of the cluster.</p><h2 id="expose-creating-a-reverse-tunnel">Expose: Creating a Reverse Tunnel</h2><p>The <code>expose</code> command takes <code>namespace/service</code> as an argument that allows you to point a Kubernetes service down to your machine's service instance.

Localizer then creates an OpenSSH pod with the Kubernetes service's selector, which makes Kubernetes route traffic to the created pod. Localizer creates an SSH reverse proxy over a Kubernetes port-forward (which …</p></div></div>

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>You are already managing <a href="https://www.common-lisp.net/" target="_blank">common-lisp.net</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/" target="_blank">cliki.net</a>, both crucial resources.

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!

Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, describes his companyâ€™s shipping culture in one of his <a href="https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships">blog posts</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They like to keep projects to one person. And every person is responsible for shipping something every single week. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s quite a polarizing culture. So much so that Naval makes explicit that their environment is wrong for most people. Theyâ€™re looking for independent people who can ship code and if you donâ€™t fit that type, you should go look elsewhere:
</p>


<blockquote>
    If they canâ€™t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. Thereâ€™s someplace for everyone.
    <span>Naval Ravikant</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wish more companies would do this. When youâ€™re able to clearly outline your values, you tend to attract individuals that stick. 
</p>
<p>
And sometimes, itâ€™s just as important to list all the reasons why someone <em>wouldnâ€™t enjoy</em> working at a company as it is to list everything good about the company.

Information like this is gold dust. Think about the countless <em>years</em> people waste working at companies that theyâ€™re not suited for. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the role above would be a bad fit for me. Iâ€™m at a stage of my career where mentorship would be helpful and Iâ€™d like to execute on projects that are clearly defined in scope. 
</p>
<p>
If a company is not able to explain to me what would make someone a bad candidate for the role, then that would worry me. If youâ€™re not able to eliminate <em>anyone</em> for a role, then the job position itself has likely not been set up for success.

<h2>Build a team that ships</h2>


<p>
I want to talk a bit more about AngelListâ€™s prolific shipping culture.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a ceramics experiment that was done (can be traced back to this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20">book</a>) in which the teacher divided the class into two groups. 
</p>
<p>
One group would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, whilst the other solely on its quality.
</p>
<p>
The grading procedure was simple:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œOn the final day of class, the instructor would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to grading time. Can you guess what happened? 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œIt seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Naval acknowledges that shipping at the velocity they do is not ideal. They make mistakes and many of the features they release are half-baked. 
</p>
<p>
But it is also precisely <em>because</em> they ship so much that theyâ€™re able to get it right. Just like the â€œquantityâ€� group, the engineers at AngelList are constantly iterating and testing out their assumptions. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than always being in paralysis mode, they just build the damn thing. And if it doesnâ€™t work, they try again until it does.
