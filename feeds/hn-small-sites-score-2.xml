<div>
<p>There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:</p>
<blockquote><p>it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? </li>
<li>How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)</li>
<li>That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people believe Julia is fast <strong>because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled</strong> (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, <strong>type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch</strong> is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and "look like a scripting language". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.</p>
<p>But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some "lunches lost" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.</p>
<p>To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math.</p>

<h2 id="Arithmetic-in-Julia">Arithmetic in Julia<a href="#Arithmetic-in-Julia">¶</a></h2><p>In general, math in Julia looks the same as in other scripting languages. One detail to note is that the numbers are "true numbers", as in a <code>Float64</code> is truly the same thing as a 64-bit floating point number or a "double" in C. A <code>Vector{Float64}</code> is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense "Julia is a layer on top of C") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).</p>
<p>Some math in Julia:</p>

<p>Note here that I showed off Julia's unicode tab completion. Julia allows for unicode characters, and these can be used by tab completing Latex-like statements. Also, multiplication by a number is allowed without the * if followed by a variable. For example, the following is allowed Julia code:</p>

<h2 id="Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">Type-stability and Code Introspection<a href="#Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">¶</a></h2><p>Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from <code>*(::Float64,::Float64)</code> is a <code>Float64</code>. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a <code>Float64</code>. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the <code>*</code> operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>; Function *
; Location: int.jl:54
define i64 @"julia_*_33751"(i64, i64) {
top:
  %2 = mul i64 %1, %0
  ret i64 %2
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This output is saying that a floating point multiplication operation is performed and the answer is returned. We can even look at the assembly</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>	.text
; Function * {
; Location: int.jl:54
	imulq	%rsi, %rdi
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	retq
	nopl	(%rax,%rax)
;}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This shows us that the <code>*</code> function has compiled down to exactly the same operation as what happens in C/Fortran, meaning it achieves the same performance (even though it's defined in Julia). Thus it is possible to not just get "close" to C, but actually get the same C code out. In what cases does this happen?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Julia is that, asking which cases this happens is not the right question. the right question is, in what cases does the code not compile to something as efficient as C/Fortran? The key here is type-stability. If a function is type-stable, then the compiler can know what the type will be at all points in the function and smartly optimize it to the same assembly as C/Fortran. If it is not type-stable, Julia has to add expensive "boxing" to ensure types are found/known before operations.</p>
<h4 id="This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">This is the key difference between Julia and other scripting languages<a href="#This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">¶</a></h4><p>The upside is that Julia's functions, when type stable, are essentially C/Fortran functions. Thus <code>^</code> (exponentiation) is fast. However, <code>^(::Int64,::Int64)</code> is type-stable, so what type should it output?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<div>
<p>Here we get an error. In order to guarantee to the compiler that <code>^</code> will give an Int64 back, it has to throw an error. If you do this in MATLAB, Python, or R, it will not throw an error. That is because those languages do not have their entire language built around type stability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens when we don't have type stability? Let's inspect this code:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>

<div>




<div>

	callq	*%rax
	popq	%rcx
	retq
	nop
;}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Now let's define our own exponentiation on integers. Let's make it "safe" like the form seen in other scripting languages:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[8]:</p>

<div>
<pre>expo (generic function with 1 method)</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Let's make sure it works:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens if we inspect this code?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>That's a very visual demonstration on why Julia achieves such higher performance than other scripting languages by how it uses type inference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.<a href="#Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">¶</a></h4><p>This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that <code>*</code> can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> before calling <code>*</code>, then it knows which <code>*</code> method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of <code>c=a*b</code>. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows <code>*</code> to mean the "right thing" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.</p>
<p>There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be "more explicit than meets the eye". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia.</p>

<h2 id="The-Julia-Benchmarks">The Julia Benchmarks<a href="#The-Julia-Benchmarks">¶</a></h2><p>The Julia benchmarks, featured on <a href="http://julialang.org/">the Julia website</a>, test components of the programming language for speed. <strong>This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention</strong>. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say "wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.</p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR &gt;XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&amp;src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScript™</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what we've chosen to communicate is annoying as fuck</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
    </p>

        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are?

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS.

With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168).

That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

<![CDATA[What ORMs Have Taught Me: Just Learn SQL (2014)]]>

<![CDATA[

October 20, 2020 | https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Some background: For the past 30 months I’ve been working with code
that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most
of that has been with <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (which I quite like) and <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
(which I don’t). I’ve worked with existing code and data models, as
well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage
(“timelines”) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance
Mismatch. It’s hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, in his
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">well known essay</a>, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into
quagmires. In my experience, I’ve had to deal directly with a fair
number of them: <i>entity identity issues</i>, <i>dual-schema problem</i>, <i>data
retrieval mechanism concern</i>, and the <i>partial-object problem</i>. I want to
talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my
own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge4f50a6">
<h2 id="orge4f50a6">Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys</h2>
<div id="text-orge4f50a6">
<p>
Perhaps the most subversive issue I’ve had with ORMs is “attribute
creep” or “wide tables”, that is, tables that just keep accruing
attributes. As much as I’d like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes
necessary (although things like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html">Postgres’ hstore</a> can help). For
example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they
want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore,
you don’t have much insight into this data; you’re just schlepping it
around.
</p>

<p>
This in and of itself isn’t a terrible thing in a database. It becomes
a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to
show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the
query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.
</p>

<pre>query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq("x", value))
</pre>

<p>
This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire
hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using <code>SELECT
*</code>, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however,
encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as
tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding
the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to
seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a
Java object.)
</p>

<p>
Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign
keys. In the ORMs I’ve used, links between classes are represented in
the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully,
result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A
recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600
attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred
query methodology.)
</p>

<p>
Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in
order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My
contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL
since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d7e33d">
<h2 id="org2d7e33d">Data retrieval</h2>
<div id="text-org2d7e33d">
<p>
Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt
to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important
when efficiency is a concern.
</p>

<p>
From what I’ve seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that
is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure
out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of
the time, it’s more obfuscated than actual SQL.
</p>

<p>
And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of
work in the code that could be done in the database faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function">Window
functions</a> are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with
ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be
transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your
application.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, I’ve elected to write queries using a templating
system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of
an application level description of the table with direct use of
SQL. It’s a lot less trouble than anything else I’ve used so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05d550b">
<h2 id="org05d550b">Dual schema dangers</h2>
<div id="text-org05d550b">
<p>
This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you
try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive
complexity.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places:
the database and your application.  If you keep the definition
entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data
Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same
complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it
in the database, you will probably want a representation in the
application for convenience and to prevent too much “string typing”.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it
into the application.  It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it
more manageable.  I’ve found that reflection techniques to get the
data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the
redundancy of data definitons in two places.
</p>

<p>
But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the
model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the
database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application
data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don’t help
manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the
database’s data definitions aren’t things you should manipulate in the
application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is,
the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking
about objects, I think about functions with return types.
</p>

<p>
Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but
convenience in making queries?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7033826">
<h2 id="org7033826">Identities</h2>
<div id="text-org7033826">
<p>
Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to
keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write
for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.
</p>

<p>
When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an
identifier. In your application, “identifier” takes on various
meanings, but usually it’s the memory location (a pointer). In the
database, it’s the state of the object itself. These two things don’t
really get along because you can really only use database identifiers
in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you’re working
with).
</p>

<p>
What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database
identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to
get the actual database identifier.
</p>

<p>
I can’t even call this a leaky abstraction because the work “leak”
implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddbdda4">
<h2 id="orgddbdda4">Transactions</h2>
<div id="text-orgddbdda4">
<p>
Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle
transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful
but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the
confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate
code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where
transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session
objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate
with the database.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to
their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping
is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical
scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know
about the “when” of a transaction when writing code that works with
databases and can make modularity tricky (“Here’s a useful function
that will only work in certain contexts”).
</p>

<p>
Where do I see myself going?
</p>

<p>
At this point, I’m starting to question the wisdom behind the outright
rejection of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures">stored procedures</a>.  It sounds <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil">heretical</a>, but it may work
for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of “devops”, the divide
between the developer and the database administrator is basically
non-existent.)
</p>

<p>
I’ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data
type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some
type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving
away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be
stored in a database (the raison d’être for ORMs) and instead thinking
of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I’ve found working
with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering
why I didn’t see it earlier.
</p>

<p>
(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all
applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that
this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren’t actually
that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing:
I won’t fall into the “ORMs make it easy” trap. They are an acceptable
way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries
and a bad way to store object state. If you’re using an RDBMS, bite
the bullet and learn SQL.

                <p>There are many factors that influence the delivery of software faster at reduced cost. According to
                    the WQR, slower time to market, increased QA costs and an over dependence on manual testing are a
                    major bottleneck in ensuring the release
                    of better products, faster.</p>
                <p>Its time every company shifted from Manual testing to Test Automation to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of software test automation is to simplify the software testing process as easy as
                    possible with minimum effort. Test Automation has a positive impact on the cost, quality and time to

                <p>Enhancements or changes made to an application must be tested and retested to check that it does not
                    break the existing code. Test Automation is most effective in performing such regression tests on
                    multiple device/OS/browser combinations
                    with the help of Automated testing tools.</p>
                <p>This would be a tedious task, if done manually. Functional Testers need to go through every feature
                    of the application, look for possible input combinations, compare and document each outcome with the
                    expected one.</p>
                <p>In such short cycles it is difficult to test every feature of the application, manually. Manual
                    Testing would require a lot of resources, time and cost for this.</p>
                <p>Without Test Automation one has to compromise on the test coverage, which is not recommended.</p>
                <p>However, Manual Testing cannot be overlooked as it involves creative and logical analysis of the
                    application under test.</p>
                <p>There is a need of an integrated manual testing and test automation environment to improve the
                    collaboration between the teams and increase productivity. </p><br>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                            Test Automation speeds up the testing process</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once created, automated tests can be run over and again at no additional cost and can increase
                        the pace of executing tests in different versions of device, browser and OS combinations. This
                        reduces the testing time in each cycle.</p>
                </li>

                            Test Automation increases Test Coverage</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>As the tests are automated you can choose to execute some or all of the tests to cover the
                        affected areas. You don't need to compromise on the coverage due to a lack of time towards the
                        end of the cycle.</p>
                    <p>Execute multiple complex tests across different OS/Device/Browser combinations and with different
                        Test Data sets that help increase the test coverage.</p>

                        <strong>Test Automation improves Accuracy</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Test Automation tools execute a set of scripted steps systematically and record the results every
                        time they are executed. The accuracy of results are more in less time compared to Manual
                        testing.</p>

                            Test Automation allows for faster delivery of products</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the test script is developed, the tests can be re-executed any number of times, anytime.
                        This allows the Functional testers to do exploratory testing and to check for the usability of
                        the product. Test Automation allows for a speedy delivery of better quality products into the
                        market.

                <h3>Getting started with Test Automation</h3>
                <p>Test Automation is not just about programming the test actions. It is an ecosystem of various
                    components and resources like the test automation team, test automation tools, test environments,
                    proper management of test data, integrations
                    that help deliver quality software faster.</p>

                        <p> Expertise in multiple tools and technologies for different application types</p>
                    </li>

                        <p> Need for training on the tools being used </p>
                    </li>

                        <p> Availability of realistic Test Environments to try and execute tests </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Integrations with multiple tools like Test Management tool, Test Data Management tool, CI/CD
                            tools, Defect tracking and reporting tools, Collaboration tools etc. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It takes significant time and effort to set the Test Automation ecosystem. Each application type
                    would require different sets of tools and one tool that suffices every application type hardly
                    exist. Though Test Automation is the right
                    choice in identifying and fixing bugs at an early stage, there are several tailbacks associated with
                    it.</p>
                <p>This initial demand of cost, resources, time and effort, makes it difficult for smaller teams to get
                    started with Test Automation.

        <p>About 6 years ago, when I was in my first few months at Pebble as a firmware engineer, I decided to take an entire workday to read through the majority of the GDB manual. It was by far one of my best decisions as an early professional engineer. After that day, I felt like I was 10x faster at debugging the Pebble firmware and our suite of unit tests. I even had a new <code>.gdbinit</code> script with a few macros and configuration flags to boot, which I continue to amend to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned from many firmware developers and am here writing this post to share what I’ve learned along the way. If you have any comments or suggestions about this post, I would love to hear from you in <a href="https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/">Interrupt’s Slack channel</a>.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this reference-style post, we discuss some of the more advanced and powerful commands of the GNU debugger, GDB, as well as cover some of the best practices and hacks I’ve found over the years that help make GDB more pleasant to use.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>Although there might be debuggers and interfaces out there that provide better experiences than using GDB directly, many of them are built on top of GDB and provide raw access to the GDB shell, where you can build and use automation through the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">Python scripting API</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of most of the sections, there are links to either subpages with the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">GDB manual</a> or to the original content to learn more about the topic discussed.</p>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>

<p>First, we need to cover the items which I feel are most important for any developer or team to work efficiently within GDB.</p>



<p>There’s no better place to start learning GDB than to first learn how to search the help menus. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, GDB has over 1500+ commands!</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Count number of GDB commands in the master help list
$ gdb --batch -ex 'help all' | grep '\-\-' | wc
    1512   16248  117306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in mind, the most useful command within GDB is <code>apropos</code>, which searches all the “help” menus of each command. To use it, simply type <code>apropos &lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) apropos symbol
add-symbol-file -- Load symbols from FILE, assuming FILE has been dynamically loaded.
add-symbol-file-from-memory -- Load the symbols out of memory from a dynamically loaded object file.
attach -- Attach to a process or file outside of GDB.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the individual help menu of any command in GDB, just type <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and GDB will output everything it knows about the command or subcommand.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help apropos
Search for commands matching a REGEXP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If help is used on a collection of commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help info
Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged.

List of info subcommands:

info address -- Describe where symbol SYM is stored.
info all-registers -- List of all registers and their contents, for selected stack frame.
info args -- All argument variables of current stack frame or those matching REGEXPs.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html#index-apropos">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="gdb-history">GDB History</h3>

<p>Next, we need to ensure that command history is enabled.</p>

<p>By default GDB does not save any history of the commands that were run during each session. This is especially annoying because GDB supports <code>CTRL+R</code> for history search just like your shell!</p>

<p>To fix this, we can place the following in our <code>.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set history save on
set history size 10000
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in place, GDB will now keep the last 10,000 commands in a file ~/.gdb_history.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Command-History.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="sharing-gdbinit-files">Sharing <code>.gdbinit</code> Files</h3>

<p>I’m a huge believer in developer productivity, and I try my best to share my best-practices with co-workers and the greater community. In the past, I’ve made it a point to have per-project GDB configuration files that are automatically loaded for everyone by default.</p>

<p>This could be in a bash script <code>debug.sh</code> which developers use instead of typing <code>gdb</code> and all the arguments by hand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

gdb build/symbols.elf <span>\</span>
    <span>-ix</span><span>=</span>./gdb/project.gdbinit <span>\</span>
    <span>--ex</span><span>=</span><span>'source ./gdb/extra_gdb.py'</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better yet, you can build a <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects">Project CLI using Invoke</a> which wraps the GDB invocation into an <code>invoke debug</code> command.</p>

<p>This ensures that everyone working on the project has the latest set of configuration flags and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">GDB Python scripts</a> to accelerate their debugging.</p>

<h2 id="source-files">Source Files</h2>

<p>With the essentials out of the way, let’s dive into learning GDB! The first thing to talk about is how best to view and navigate the source code while debugging.</p>

<h3 id="directory-search-paths">Directory Search Paths</h3>

<p>Many times, the CI system builds with absolute paths instead of paths relative to the project root, which causes GDB not to be able to find the source files.</p>

<p>It will produce an error like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) f 1
#2  cli_state_collect (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:1952
1952	../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:
    No such file or directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are proactive and want to fix this permanently in the build step, you can follow the steps in Interrupt’s post about <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/reproducible-firmware-builds">Reproducible Firmware Builds</a> to make the paths relative.</p>

<p>If you want to patch it up now in GDB, you can use a combination of the <code>set substitute-path</code> and <code>directory</code> commands in GDB, depending on how the paths are built.</p>

<p>To fix the above issue, all I needed to do was to add a local directory. After adding it, GDB can find the source code of the line in the frame.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) directory sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk/
Source directories searched: /[...]/sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) f 1
#1  0x000292a2 in cli_execute (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:2554
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="source-context-with-list">Source Context with <code>list</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to quickly add a few lines above and below the current line. To quickly view ten lines of source-code context within GDB, you can use the <code>list</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) list
2549	                &amp;p_static_entry,
2550	                &amp;static_entry);
2551
2552	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd = p_static_entry;
2553
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
2555	                                               argc - cmd_handler_lvl,
2556	                                               &amp;argv[cmd_handler_lvl]);
2557	    }
2558	    else if (handler_cmd_lvl_0 != NULL)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to set a larger or smaller default number of lines shown with this command, you can change the setting:</p>

<h3 id="viewing-assembly-with-disassemble">Viewing Assembly With <code>disassemble</code></h3>

<p>It’s often useful to dive into the assembly of a specific function. GDB has this capability built-in and can even interleave the source code with the assembly (by using the <code>/s</code> option).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /s nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on
Dump of assembler code for function nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on:
nrf_cli.c:
3511	{
3512	    if (nrf_cli_build_in_cmd_common_executed(p_cli, (argc != 1), NULL, 0))
   0x0002969c &lt;+0&gt;:	ldr	r3, [r0, #8]
   0x0002969e &lt;+2&gt;:	ldr.w	r2, [r3, #316]	; 0x13c

nrf_cli.h:
604	    return p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;internal.flag.show_help;
   0x000296a2 &lt;+6&gt;:	lsls	r2, r2, #30
   0x000296a4 &lt;+8&gt;:	bmi.n	0x296b8 &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+28&gt;

nrf_cli.c:
3391	    if (arg_cnt_nok)
   0x000296a6 &lt;+10&gt;:	cmp	r1, #1
   0x000296a8 &lt;+12&gt;:	bne.n	0x296bc &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+32&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want something more powerful than <code>disassemble</code>, you can use <code>objdump</code> itself. Interrupt’s <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-binutils#objdump">post on GNU Binutils</a> is a great reference for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Machine-Code.html">Reference</a></p>

<h2 id="gdb-visual-interfaces">GDB Visual Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are many visual interfaces that are built into or on top of GDB. Let’s go through a few of the most popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-tui">GDB TUI</h3>

<p>GDB has a built-in graphical interface for viewing source code, registers, assembly, and other various items, and it’s quite simple to use!</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/advanced-gdb/gdb-tui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can start the TUI interface by running:</p>



<p>This should give you the source code viewer. You are now able to type <code>next</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc. and the TUI interface will update and follow along.</p>

<p>If you want to view the assembly as well, you can run:</p>



<p>To show the registers at the top of the window, you can type:</p>



<h3 id="alternate-gdb-interfaces">Alternate GDB Interfaces</h3>

<p>Although TUI is nice, I don’t know many people who use it and see it more as a gimmick. It’s great for quick observations and exploration, but I would suggest spending the 15-30 minutes to get something set up that is more powerful and permanent.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB">Conque-GDB</a> if you’d like to stick with using GDB itself.</p>

<p>For a full list of GUI enhancements to GDB, you can check out the list of plugins from my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager#neat-gdb-script-repositories">previous post on GDBundle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gdbgui">gdbgui</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gdbgui.com/">gdbgui</a> is a browser-based frontend to GDB, built by Chad Smith, who also happens to be the author of another one of my favorite tools, <a href="https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx">pipx</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs01/gdbgui/master/screenshots/gdbgui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>gdbgui is great tool if you don’t want to use a vendor-provided debugger but still want to have a visual way to interface with GDB.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode has pretty good support for GDB baked in. If you are just using GDB to debug C/C++ code locally on your machine, you should be able to follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug">official instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do remote debugging on devices connected with OpenOCD, PyOCD, or JLink, you’ll want to look into the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide">Platform.io</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug">Cortex-Debug</a> extensions.</p>

<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>The next topic to cover is interacting with registers through GDB.</p>

<h3 id="printing-registers">Printing Registers</h3>

<p>You can print the register values within GDB using <code>info registers</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info registers
r0             0x2                 2

<p>The term technical debt is so common that you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the software world that hasn’t heard of it. But what <em>is </em>technical debt? There are a few frameworks out there, so I’ll list them quickly, but I’d like to present one I’ve found especially useful with the teams I work on or advise.</p>



<h4>Existing Frameworks</h4>



<p>First, it’s helpful to define what technical debt is <em>not</em>. Bob Martin has a great article on this called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A Mess is not a Technical Debt</a>. “A mess is just a mess”. You can make short-term decisions that may not be best for the long-term, if you’re under constraints, but you should still do it in a prudent way.</p>



<p>Martin Fowler expands on this by creating a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, with two dimensions: deliberate vs. inadvertent, and reckless vs. prudent.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Nx_D515LmtBbvoQEq0CjgtoEzjdBur2GBmJ2bklYsXQLlwlB0vSI6awa7KqUmG5Kdx7ADsI9ukzSoJZLnMg_sXF2ph6pJbr1LGR7YS9ubiKZr9TWtMpsLb_Srm89vfSEtbkiUO" alt=""></figure>



<p>Ideally, you’re in the right half of this two-by-two: always prudent, because there’s no excuse for being reckless. But, if you’re low on experience for the type of system you’re designing, you might be prudent and inadvertent. Martin Fowler argues that prudent / inadvertent is really common with great designers, because they are always learning.</p>



<p>One of my favorite frameworks is from the Mythical Man-Month’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a> essay. Fred Brooks breaks down complexity (which is a little different than technical debt) into to dimensions: accidental complexity and essential complexity. Essential complexity is caused by the complexity of the underlying problem that software solves—accidental complexity is introduced by the implementation developers take. In this world, technical debt is, essentially all accidental complexity.</p>



<p>A final framework defines technical debt as the gap between how software is structured and how you would structure it if you were writing it from scratch today (I don’t remember where I read this definition, please tell me if you do!). In this world, technical debt is a little more fluid, because it can increase simply by your team thinking up a better architecture or design.</p>



<h4>A different framework—manifestations</h4>



<p>These frameworks are all great, and in fact, you can go even deeper to define what technical debt <em>looks like</em>. Books like Refactoring and Clean Code have done this well. But usually, what you need, is something a little more concrete that you can make decisions about.</p>



<p>So the framework I like to use is to look at <em>manifestations</em> of technical debt; what impact does it have?</p>



<p>At a high-level, technical debt can manifest itself in two ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interrupts:</strong> Interrupts are when existing systems are taxing your time through reactive work like maintenance, bugs, fire-fighting, etc, so you spend less time being able to change a system. In other words, writing code now that creates interrupts in the future means you (or someone else) will be able to spend less time on forward work in the future. Both the quantity and severity of interrupts matter. Interrupts are particularly hazardous because they usually result in forced context switching.</li><li><strong>Inertia: </strong>Inertia means that a system is hard to make forward changes to (because it is hard to understand or reason about, because it’s not modular and hence hard to change, etc). This makes forward work difficult for you (ie even when you can spend time doing forward work, it’s really slow) or for others (e.g. because the system is hard to understand, it is a tax on the time of people who need to learn more about it, as well as on people who need to explain to others how it works).</li></ul>



<p>Why look at the manifestations? Two reasons.</p>



<p>First, it helps identify the tangible symptoms and effect of technical debt, and helps avoid theoreticals. For instance, most teams have at least one part of their code base that they feel pretty bad about, and would love to spend time fixing. Is it worth fixing now? Sometimes, that code is well-isolated and pretty functional. It isn’t creating any interrupts. No one is changing it or will need to change it in the near future. So yes, it is technical debt, and it might have inertia, but inertia only matters if that code needs to be changed.</p>



<p>Secondly, by identifying the effects of technical debt, you can decide how best to fix it. For instance, if a piece of code is really hard to change because it suffers from <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Software_Design/Change_amplification#:~:text=As%20a%20code%20quality%2C%20change,atomic%20change%20to%20the%20software.">change amplification</a>, and you expect to be making a lot of changes to it, it’s probably worth refactoring. If a piece of code is creating a lot of interrupts and not creating value for users, you might want to just get rid of it entirely.</p>



<p>So sometimes, it’s useful to start with the symptoms before the diagnoses, and look at how technical debt manifests itself before deciding what to do about it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago I added <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-clarifies-jamstack-remarks#comment-344626">this comment in WPTavern</a>, on an article where WordPress founder's Matt Mullenweg clarifies his earlier remarks that the Jamstack is "a regression for the vast majority of the people adopting it".</p><p>Since I like owing my own content, I reproduce it here in my own blog.</p><hr><p>I think Matt’s brutal honesty is welcome, because most information out there about the Jamstack praises it. However, it also comes from developers using these modern new tools, evaluating their own convenience and satisfaction. As Matt points out, that doesn’t mean it makes it easier for the end user to use the software, which is what WordPress is good at.</p><p>I actually like the Jamstack, but because of how complex it is, it’s rather limiting, even to support some otherwise basic functionality.</p><p>The definitive example is comments, which should be at the core websites building communities. WordPress is extremely good at supporting comments in the site. The Jamstack is sooooo bad at it. In all these many years, nobody has been able to solve comments for the Jamstack, which for me evidences that it is inherently unsuitable to support this feature.</p><p>All attempts so far have been workarounds, not solutions. Eg:</p><ul><li>Netlify forms: no hierarchy, so can post a comment but not a response (unless adding some meta to the comment body? how ugly is that?)</li><li>Storing comments in a GitHub repo: it takes a long time to merge the PR with the comment</li></ul><p>Also, all these solutions are overtly complicated. Do I need to set-up a webhook to trigger a new build just to add a comment? And then, maybe cache the new comment in the client’s LocalStorage for if the user refreshes the page immediately, before the new build is finished? Seriously?</p><p>And then, they don’t provide the killer feature: to send notifications of the new comment to all parties involved in the discussion. That’s how communities get built, and websites become successful. Speed is a factor. But more important than speed, it is dynamic functionality to support communities. The website may look fancy, but it may well become a ghost town.</p><p>(Btw, as an exercise, you can research which websites started as WordPress and then migrated to the Jamstack, and check how many comments they had then vs now… the numbers will, most likely, be waaaaaaay down)</p><p>Another way is to not pre-render the comments, but render them dynamically after fetching it with an API. Yes, this solution works, but then you still have WordPress (or some other CMS) in the back-end to store the comments :P</p><p>The final option is to use 3rd parties such as Disqus to handle this functionality for you. Then, I will be sharing my users’ data with the 3rd party, and they may use it who knows how, and for the benefit of who (most likely, not my users’). Since I care about privacy, that’s a big no for me.</p><p>As a result, my own blog, which is a Jamstack site, doesn’t support comments! What do I do if I want feedback on a blog post? I add a link to a corresponding tweet, asking to add a comment there. I myself feel ashamed at this compromise, but given my site’s stack, I don’t see how I can solve it.</p><p>I still like my blog as a Jamstack, though, because it’s fast, it’s free, and I create all the blog posts in Markdown using VSCode. But I can’t create a community! So, as Matt says, there are things the Jamstack can handle. But certainly not everything. And possibly, not the one(s) that enable your your website to become successful.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Network programming is something that can be tricky in every programming language. Fortunately all network programming makes use of BSD sockets, a paradigm that almost universal in all modern operating systems and programming languages.</p><p>In this article, I'll show you how you can program sockets in Lisp using the SBCL implementation. You see, the Common Lisp specification has no specification for socket programming. So every Lisp compiler is free to specify it's own implementation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a first version of this article and only focusses on writing a Lisp server. I'll update this article later to include a Lisp client.</p><div id="general-flow-for-sockets">
<h2>General flow for sockets</h2>
<p>All systems making use of network sockets follow a similar flow. The flow does differ between client and server implementations.</p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>create a socket</strong> and set the desired <strong>socket options</strong>. Next you have to <strong>bind</strong> the socket to a specific address. An <em>address</em> in socket programming is a combination of an IP address and a port number. After the socket is bound to an address, the server can listen to incoming connections of clients.</p>
</div><div id="writing-a-lisp-server">
<h2>Writing a Lisp server</h2>
<p>Let's start by writing a simple server in Lisp. Note that this code won't work just yet, follow along.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>#(</span><span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*port*</span> <span>8080</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>; Bind to an address</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind</span> <span>server</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>*port*</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-listen</span> <span>server</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>First we define two parameters, <strong>address</strong> and <strong>port</strong>. The <strong>address</strong> parameter is a vector respresenting the <em>IP address 0.0.0.0</em>. The <strong>port</strong> parameter is the integer 8080. Binding our socket to this address will let it listen on all IP addresses of the computer we run this program on.</p>
<p>In the <em>start-server</em> function we first create a socket by creating an instance of <em>inet-socket</em>. Next we set the options and then bind it to the address. Finally we start listening on the socket.</p>
<p>Next we have to accept any client connections and handle those connections. For our example we will create a server that will echo everything a client sends and then close the connection.</p>
<p>Let's update our <em>start-server</em> function to accept connections and pass the connection to a handler function. To make reading from the socket a bit easier, I've added a helper function <em>read-from-connection</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>; Bind to an address</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind</span> <span>server</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>*port*</span><span>)</span>

        <span>(</span><span>loop</span>

 <span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-from-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
     <span>"Read data from a connection."</span>
     <span>(</span><span>multiple-value-bind</span> <span>(</span><span>buffer</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-receive</span> <span>connection</span> <span>nil</span> <span>1024</span><span>)</span>

                 <span>(</span><span>subseq</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>0</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span>
                 <span>data</span><span>))))</span>

 <span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
     <span>"Handle an incoming connection."</span>
     <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-send</span> <span>connection</span> <span>data</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see we had to do some processing of the data received from the socket. Our function <em>read-from-connection</em> reads up to 1024 bytes from the connection. Lisp has to <em>allocate</em> an entire buffer of that length, but only a certain number of bytes are received. So we simple return the part of the buffer equal to the length of the data written.</p>
<p>In the <em>handle-connection</em> function, we read data from the connection using our helper function. Then we simply send that data back to the connection by using the <strong>socket-send</strong> function, and finally close our socket by making use of the <strong>socket-close</strong> function.</p>
<p>To connect to our server you can use the telnet command on your computer:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>michael@winston:~<span>|</span>⇒  telnet <span>127</span>.0.0.1 <span>9000</span>
Trying <span>127</span>.0.0.1...
Connected to <span>127</span>.0.0.1.
Escape character is <span>'^]'</span>.
Lisp is amazing!
Lisp is amazing!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see the telnet commands establishes a connection. We then enter something ("Lisp is amazing!" in my example) and press enter. The server immediately echos back what we sent it and closes the connection.</p>
<p>The complete example up untill now can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">simple echo server</a> file.</p>
<div id="handling-multiple-client-connections">
<h3>Handling multiple client connections</h3>
<p>Our design has one important flaw. Because of the way our server handles connections, only one connection can be handled by our server at a time.</p>
<p>You can test this out by connecting two telnet sessions to our server, just connect but don't send anything just yet. If you send a string to our server on the second telnet session, you won't get an immediate reply. The connection will stay open, without a response, untill the first session is finished. Send something through the first telnet session and you'll notice the second session will get a response and close after the first session does.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the flow of our server, you'll see that our loop that accepts connections is 'kept busy' by our <em>handle-connection</em> function. We can't accept new connections while our <em>handle-connection</em> function hasn't finished. In this particular case, the impact is negligible: since we simple read, send and then close the connection we will quickly return to the loop accepting connections. But image if our connection handler would keep the connection alive and read multiple times from a connection? Bad design!</p>
<p>Luckily, we can easily fix this by starting a new thread for each connection and handle the connection in the new thread.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>sb-thread:make-thread</span>
        <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>; Handle our connection in this lambda, which is run in a new thread</span>
            <span>(</span><span>loop</span>
                <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
                    <span>; Do something with the data received</span>
                    <span>))</span>
            <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>))))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We changed our <em>handle-connection</em> function to make a new thread. That thread will spin off from the main server thread and continue on its own. While the thread is running it's own loop in this case, the server is free to accept new connections that will be handled by threads of their own.</p>
<p>If you test our server with two telnet session like we did before, you'll notice our server now responds as expected. The fact that one client was connected first, but hasn't finished yet, makes no difference when handling a second client.</p>
<p>The full example can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">threaded echo server</a> file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL has become a widely adopted standard over the past few years. However, not everyone is taking advantage of the full capabilities of the standard. In this article, I’ll demonstrate methods for creating more expressive schemas that better fit your data needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start by defining an example scenario. We’re building a forum application, which will have several types of users:</p><ul role="list"><li>Standard users that post and read content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Moderators that oversee forum postings and police activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Administrators that manage the operations of the forum. For example, dealing with technical issues, assigning moderators, and more.</li></ul><p>What might a schema for such a site look like? Let’s start off with a barebones schema. This example will be using a Node Express and GraphQL project. I’ll assume you already know how to do that, but I will include the entire project code at the bottom of the article later. Create a typeDefs.ts file like this. Notice that we’re using TypeScript, since the type annotations help make the code more clear.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
import { gql } from "apollo-server-express"; 
 
const typeDefs = gql` 
  type StandardUser { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
 
export default typeDefs; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>You’ll notice that we have the three user types, and an additional type called Category, which represents the group that our posts will go into. However it’s clear there is repetition across our fields (e.g. id, username). It’s in fact possible to pull out a “base type” from each of the three user related types. Let’s attempt to do this by updating this schema using Interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Interfaces&nbsp;</h3><p>An interface is just a skeleton of sorts. It’s a contract that declares rules, in this case specific fields, however it has no implementation and therefore cannot return data. Only types can. However since it does provide structure, we are using Interfaces to define base fields and then have our types implement those Interfaces. For example, if we update our typeDefs with Interfaces it could look like this.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
const typeDefs = gql` 
  interface Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
  } 
 
  interface User implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  interface Rating { 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type StandardUser implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator implements Identifiable &amp; User { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>If we start at the top, you’ll see our first interface is called Identifiable. Since all of the entities in our data model have a unique ID, this interface will be the base for all of our entities. Next, we see that the User interface implements the Identifiable interface. Notice how User has both the id field and its own field called userName. When a type or interface implements an interface, they must implement all of its fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next up we have another interface called Rating. Since two of our types StandardUser and Moderator use the stars field, but Administrator does not, we have this interface so that only the types that use the stars field can implement it – otherwise, the User models can skip it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we finally have our actual types StandardUser, Moderator, and Administrator, where each one implements only the interfaces it needs by using an &amp; symbol to denote more than one interface being implemented. Then lastly the Category type.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as you can see this set of types and hierarchies is quite reminiscent of most modern programming languages, for example TypeScript.</p><p>We now have a reasonable schema model. Let’s try querying it. Update the typeDefs variable by adding this Query.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
type Query { 
    getAllUsers: [User!] 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>As you can see, we’ve added a function that retrieves all of our site’s users, but returns them as an array of Users. Let’s now write our resolver and see if this will work. First create your resolver file like the following:</p><div><pre><code>
import { IResolvers } from "apollo-server-express"; 
import { getAllUsers, User } from "../dataService"; 
import { GqlContext } from "./GqlContext"; 
 
const resolvers: IResolvers = { 
  Query: { 
    getAllUsers: async ( 
      parent, 
      args: null, 
      ctx: GqlContext, 
      info: any 
	): Promise<array<user>&gt; =&gt; { 
      return getAllUsers(); 
	}, 
  }, 
}; 
 
export default resolvers; 
</array<user></code>
</pre></div><p>Our resolver’s only action is to call our getAllUsers function in order to retrieve the actual data. You’ll notice that our getAllUsers resolver is returning an array of User Interfaces. This should be a bit suspicious, but for now let’s just see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we must implement the getAllUsers function in code. But to make this article simpler and focus on GraphQL we’ll create a function that returns hard coded values. Create a file called dataService.ts and add this code.</p><div><pre><code>
import { v4 } from "uuid"; 
 
export interface Identifiable { 
  id: string; 
} 
 
export interface User extends Identifiable { 
  userName: string; 
} 
 
export interface Rating { 
  stars: number; 
} 
 
export class StandardUser implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Moderator implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number, 
    public categories: [Category] 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Administrator implements User { 
  constructor(public id: string, public userName: string) {} 
} 
 
export class Category implements Identifiable { 
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {} 
} 
 
export function getAllUsers() { 
  const users: Array<user> = []; 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "dave", 4)); 
  users.push(new Moderator(v4(), "ruth", 5, [new Category(v4(), "Cooking")])); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "jane", 5)); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "tom", 1)); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "linda")); 
  users.push( 
    new Moderator(v4(), "tom", 2, [new Category(v4(), "Programming")]) 
  ); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "betty")); 
 
  return users; 
} 
</user></code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>Our dataService contains all of our TypeScript types that mirror our GraphQL schemas, as well as the getAllUsers function that returns a list of objects that inherit from our User Interface. As you can see, getAllUsers all types of Users, including StandardUsers and Administrators, but since they all implement the User interface (i.e. User is the parent type for all of them), the function’s return type is set as an array of User types. Now let’s try querying it!</p><h3>Querying and Fragments</h3><p>Open your GraphQL playground by opening your browser to the GraphQL server URL, which would be something like http://localhost:&lt;port number&gt;/graphql. Then add this Query as shown.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
query { 
    getAllUsers { 
  	... on User { 
        id 
        userName 
  	} 
	} 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>This is our Query for getAllUsers, but instead of fields we see three periods. What we’re seeing with the “…” is called an inline Fragment. This tells the GraphQL service which type of data we are looking for. In this case we indicate that we want the Interface User and its fields of id and userName.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s try and run this Query, but when we do we get this error shown.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-b158e79301e4-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def7201d623778ea438_PIIAWDJ_AhMP0A-vvcjwUNoHCg_WvzU_ih_MejA2hzeijfi7RI3lHvNq5pXadUM2JbGzIVoT0Ny2XqAveRkYRh7ow7xWHMnBfFIIkg6g0iXm9uHKclOT1FdRUyMomCxlR0xJr80.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.6 First query error&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>What does this error mean? If we look back at our definition of GraphQL Interfaces we said they only have declarations, but no implementations. Therefore, we need to replace the interface with an implementation of the interface, the type, that does return data. Let’s see how to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Update the resolvers variable by adding this code.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
User: { 
    __resolveType(obj: any, ctx: GqlContext, info: any) { 
      if (obj.categories) { 
        return "Moderator"; 
  	} else if (obj.stars) { 
        return "StandardUser"; 
  	} 
 
      return "Administrator"; 
	}, 
  }, 
</code>
</pre></div><p>By defining the User Interface in our resolvers we are telling GraphQL that when it encounters the User in a Query it should instead return one of the specific types listed. Note, the logic of how to go about determining this is entirely up to you. However an obvious potential way of doing this would be to use member fields unique to each type, as we have done here.&nbsp;</p><p>So now when we run the same Query again we get this.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-2d373c8cffc7-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2defabcf9fda1c9bfe3c_ftxvQYJCQ3OAPpkHSZnuVL7jXMEfunX-V0p_R8ZSuXgZ2rx7WK4QzdCqH_eZJ34YFMjBO9kNz9SXa7ndzlfLx5ryJ9CAzIz7P4q-660SjiLv9BQ8pImbQkcNQtw5-0nk45evL9M.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.8 Second query updated attempt&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Clearly this works, but we’re not getting all the related fields and it’s hard to tell which type each returned item is. Let’s update our query a bit to show these details.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-f491df54febb-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def420f9a0f6c80d8c8_2SHnrjaNjXyK0u6aUR7Hz8ljFO-tgQzGVFWgEpOiM6fdGPwDDLHO06pfgwfzBt53FVEvjGY-cIqhfwt8oO3AqgfyNT2gShd68HhW-XkaXgbZ_pA-ZqG1-S4XklcIbrqENkCmbH4.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.9 Updated Query</figcaption></figure><p>If we go over this Query, we can see that by using the __typename field we get back the type name of every item in our result set. So that definitely helps clarify things somewhat. However only the StandardUser type is returning actual fields. The other types are indicated, but their type-specific data is blank! It’s clear what we need to do so let’s take a stab at it.</p><figure id="w-node-56558d760f7a-f078b551"><p><img alt="TextDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def278d58389665c636_mXZsK_WO2ymnwnCq5GMq2xctdvRhmQ3JdCo_QBrHR_K2ldFKc5T4cKUkP_eqioXJWYxdqIMN3Dlv5eECYPpgN_rxwzOJRIZLS3Pe18d353X1DuYVtKamXiEoJp1q9DbJmbY37gE.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.10 Updated Query with all types&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you probably guessed, we needed to add our other types and their specific fields. For example, in the case of Moderator we have a unique field called categories, Since the category is its own type as well, we also specified the “name” member from the type.</p><p>Now we’ve got everything working! Alas, there’s one small issue. Even after implementing such robust types, we’re still repeating the id and userName fields multiple times. In this case, it doesn’t matter much. But for larger data models, it’s quite easy to have dozens of shared fields – imagine specific all those fields repeatedly!</p><p>We’ve already seen how we can use inline …</p></div></div>

Not only do APIs give developers instant access to powerful functionality, but their programmability also makes it easy for developers to integrate disparate pieces of functionality.</p><p>But today, this only applies to <em>documented</em> APIs. This means the company responsible for the API has made a conscious choice to expose the API—and they’ve allocated the resources to creating and maintaining documentation. This also means there are a <em>lot</em> of SaaS APIs out there that could make users’ lives easier, but that haven’t been documented.</p><p>This blog post is about a new feature that my team and I built after I spent a painful couple of days figuring out how to script against Notion. After my experience trying to learn the undocumented Notion API, we decided to automate the process of learning web APIs so that nobody would have to suffer like this again.</p><p>In this blog post, I talk about:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How I tried to automate against the Notion the hard way.</p></li><li><p>How this led my team at Akita to build a new feature to automatically learn undocumented APIs.</p></li><li><p>How to use Akita to <em>automatically</em> learn APIs, including the Notion API. (See what we learned on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>!)</p></li></ul><p>To anyone who wants to learn an undocumented API–or document your own API so people don’t have to do this—you may be interested in checking out <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">our private beta</a>!<br></p><h2>🐕 First, some background</h2><p>I’m Chris, the product manager at Akita. I joined Akita after eight years at Twilio, where I helped define products like Twilio Marketplace and Twilio Channels. While I was making APIs easier to use at Twilio, I also saw how APIs made software development harder. For instance, the rise of internal and external APIs make it much more difficult to prevent breaking changes. These observations led me to join Akita about a year ago.</p><p>At Akita, we’ve been working to give structure to the interaction graph of APIs, for instance to <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/22/faster-better-earlier-catch-breaking-changes-by-diffing-api-behavior?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">detect breaking changes in web apps</a>. Akita watches API traffic to automatically generate API specs and infer implicit API contracts. Core to Akita’s approach is diffing API specs and contracts learned across different environments. We’ve been working hard to make this technology easily accessible to developers, no code changes required, in just minutes.</p><h2>💡 An observation about Notion&nbsp;</h2><p>Now for how I came to autogenerate an API spec for Notion.</p><p>As the product manager at a small startup, I spend a lot of time making sure that the right information gets to the right place. Customer feedback, blog posts like this one, product usage, and engineering metrics are just a few of the things I need to track. I also require some sleep, food, and the occasional trip outside. How do I manage to keep up? That’s easy: AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS!!!</p><p>When I joined Akita, I realized that Notion was what we needed to organize information across the team. But the problems started when we needed to add <em>new</em> information to Notion. For instance, we keep team meeting information in Notion. Most of our team meetings began with “Did someone create a Notion page?” or “Where is the page from last week’s meeting?” The same thing would happen during customer meetings.</p><p>Given how many meetings we have a week, I figured we could get several hours back <em>a week</em> if we could get computers to automate creating the Notion page for us. All we needed was to figure out how to automate Notion.<br></p><h2>😰 Thwarted by the Private API</h2><p>The catch? Notion doesn’t have a publicly documented API.</p><p>The good news is that it’s still possible to use an undocumented API. It’s easy. You could set up a headless browser to automate clicks or turn to that ol’ standby Grease Monkey script for watching your browser traffic. I recently read a blog post where the author ran a proxy and executed a man-in-the-middle attack in order to build a calendar widget for one of his favorite websites.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_27960"><div><p>Okay, it’s not easy. It took me a couple days of hacking to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriscorcoran/51b2f37a807e6f09cbbf320b63b8931a?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">reasonable solution working</a> the first time. And the undocumented API problem is prevalent among newer SaaS tools, and it makes sense: APIs are hard to build, document, and maintain. If more of these tools had APIs, I would automate more and integrate them more deeply into our workflows.<br></p><h2>⚡️ Using Akita to learn the Notion API</h2><p>I wondered if there was a better way.</p><p>Then I realized: oh wait, I’m working on building a tool that <em>lets you generate API specifications by monitoring network traffic</em>. Surely we could use Akita to build API specs from watching my interactions with Notion?</p><p>But it wasn’t completely straightforward. Up to this point, we had set up Akita with the assumption that the user wants to document their <em>own</em> API, so Akita worked by listening to network traffic through an agent.</p><p>But when I posed this problem to my engineering team, they came up with a solution that let me generate this beautiful rendition of the Notion API spec.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_67186"><p>This feature was a game-changer! Now that Akita could learn this spec, I had an OpenAPI specification that detailed every endpoint, parameter, and property that the Notion frontend used. And what made this <em>really</em> useful was Akita’s analysis layered on top.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_72403"><div><p><a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/29/taking-types-to-the-next-level-stop-api-bugs-by-inferring-data-formats?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">Akita Data Formats</a>, detecting precise data formats like unique IDs and specific datetime RFCs,&nbsp; and API Relationships, surfacing which endpoints accept values of the same data type, made it easier to understand how the endpoints worked together.</p><div><p>You can check out the API spec we were able to generate on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.</p></div><h2>🛠 How it works</h2><p>The secret to this new feature? HAR Files.</p><p>Previously, to run Akita you ran an agent alongside where you hosted a service. The agent would listen to network traffic and allow you to autogenerate API specs without having to make code changes or use a proxy. While this was super easy to use if you were learning your <em>own</em> API, it was less helpful for learning other people’s web APIs. Our new HAR file ingest allows you to learn <em>any web API</em> that relies on AJAX-style requests, <em>using any major web browser,</em> in a matter of minutes.</p><p>HAR Files are a little known feature of the Webkit Developer Console (available in major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) that allows you to record requests, performance metrics, and other interesting data from a debugging session. It turns out that it’s not so hard to extend Akita to accept HAR files instead of network traffic. HAR files are key to making it easy to autogenerate API specs, without needing headless servers or proxies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_160214"><p>Below I show a screen capture of me trying to break this new feature by returning to my old nemesis, Notion.

  <p>I heard a lot lately about using types in Haskell to describe function arguments in more details
(e.g. function takes a list that is non-empty) and thus achieve higher compile-time safety.
It sounded cool so I decided to research more about it and I created this blog post as a memo of
what I learned.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>pretty extensive, but not so intuitive. Still the most complete intro (and pretty much
the only one) to the topic. Most of my examples below are taken from it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-type-level-programming">Why type-level programming?</h2>

<p>As I wrote above, my current understanding is that with it we can add more info into the type
signature of a function, making it “safer” in the compile time.
E.g. instead of just saying <em>“this function takes a list”</em>
we can say <em>“this function takes a non-empty list”</em>, or
<em>“this function takes Int which is &gt; 10 and &lt; 127”</em> (although this last one might be solved just by
creating an appropriate type, e.g. using TH?).</p>

<p>TODO: I would love to learn about more examples where this is used.</p>

<h2 id="example-a-function-that-accepts-only-a-non-empty-list">Example: A function that accepts only a non-empty list</h2>

<p>We want to be able to tell from its type whether a list is empty or not. To do that we will
create a new type which will have that information stored in it.</p>

<p>First, let’s see how we would create a “normal” list type on our own:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is a usual recursive definition of list (<code>Cons</code> stands for <em>Constructor</em>). Once there is
an instance of this type we can tell which type of elements the list contains (e.g. <code>List Int</code>
or <code>List (Maybe String)</code>), but nothing more than that. We cannot deduce from its type (which means
in compile time) whether it is empty or not.</p>

<p>We could of course check it in runtime and throw an exception if the list is empty, but we want to
be stricter than that. We want to ensure that program cannot even be compiled if an empty list is
provided where it shouldn’t be.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-we-missing">What are we missing?</h3>

<p>The problem with the “normal” list we defined above is that we are missing information in its type.
We have only one piece of
information and that is type of the elements within the list - we use type parameter <code>a</code> to declare
that. We can also use it to define functions that work only for a specific <code>a</code>. E.g. here is a
function that works only on a list of integers:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>sumListElements</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is guaranteed in compile-time. If we call this function with a list of e.g. <code>Bool</code>s, the
compiler will throw an error at us.</p>



<p>So here’s an idea - why don’t we just use the same mechanism again (having a type parameter) to
know whether a list is empty or not. If we added another type parameter to keep track of that,
our type (disregarding data constructors for now) would look like this:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Just as type param <code>a</code> means <em>any type</em> (e.g. <code>Int</code> or <code>MyType</code>), the same applies for <code>empty</code>.
E.g. we could have <code>List Int Double</code> or <code>List String Bool</code> or <code>List Int SomeCustomType</code>.
Just as we restricted function <code>sumListElements</code> above to work only when <code>a</code> is <code>Int</code>, we can use
<code>empty</code> in the same way.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to implement a safe version of <code>head</code> function - that means it accepts only a
non-empty list as an argument, otherwise it won’t compile. We will call it <code>safeHead</code>.</p>

<p>Ok, we introduced <code>empty</code> as another type parameter, but the question we are facing now is what
do we do with it? Which concrete types will take its place and how?</p>

<p>Lets introduce two new types:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>The interesting thing here is that we have only type constructors for these types and no data
constructors. That means we cannot create instances (values) of these types, but that is ok!
We need these types only at the type level, in function signatures. Such types are also called
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Empty_type"><em>uninhabited</em> or <em>empty</em></a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s imagine we have a way to correctly assign <code>Empty</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> to empty and non-empty
lists’ types. Then we could define <code>safeHead</code> as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>safeHead</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>safeHead</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>elem</span> <span>_</span> <span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>elem</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We wouldn’t even have to define a case for <code>End</code> since the type guarantees it can’t ever happen.</p>

<h3 id="assigning-correct-type-to-empty">Assigning correct type to <code>empty</code></h3>

<p>The main question that is left is how do we produce such lists with an extra type parameter, and
how do we make sure which type <code>empty</code> takes when? This is what we will look at now.</p>

<p>This is how our type <code>List</code> looks once we have added <code>empty</code> as a second type parameter:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Except adding that extra type parameter, nothing else changed. When I first saw this,
I was confused by
the fact there is a type parameter on the left side that doesn’t appear anywhere on the right side
as a data.
How is that possible, why would that make sense? (Ok, <em>there is</em> <code>empty</code> on the right side here, but
only as a part of a type designation and not as a part of data constructor. Which means there will
never be anything of type <code>empty</code> in some value of this type).</p>

<p>But turns out it does make sense, since we use it as a designation at the type level only, to show
that an
underlying value has a certain property (empty or non-empty in this case). Such types, which have a
type parameter(s) on the left side that don’t appear on the right are
also called <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Phantom_type"><em>phantom types</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see now what happens if we create an instance of our new <code>List</code> and test its type in GHCi:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>emptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>emptyList</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>"haskell"</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span>
<span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we can see, GHCi concluded that <code>a</code> is a string in <code>nonEmptyList</code>, but could not deduce anything
for <code>empty</code> in either case, since it is not used anywhere. So how can we solve that
and make sure that <code>empty</code> becomes <code>Empty</code> for <code>emptyList</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> for <code>nonEmptyList</code>?</p>

<h3 id="gadts">GADTs</h3>

<p>Before we continue, let’s check types of our data constructors, <code>End</code> and <code>Cons</code> (since they are
functions as well, we can do that):</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>Cons</span>
<span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see they have no power to change or specify <code>empty</code> type param in any way. <code>End</code> will leave
it unspecified, while <code>Cons</code> will preserve it from the input list. Also, we have no way to change
these type signatures as they are automatically derived from <code>List</code> type definition.</p>

<p>This is exactly where GADTs come in. GADTs (<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT">Generalized Algebraic Data Types</a>) is a Haskell extension that lets us explicitly
define the type signatures of data constructors.</p>

<p>Before seeing GADTs in action, let’s first remind ourselves of the standard,
non-GADT definition of <code>List</code> we used above:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Now let’s rearrange it a bit and add types of data constructors in comments so we can more easily
reason about them:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>|</span>                   <span>-- End :: List a empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>   <span>-- Cons :: a -&gt; List a empty -&gt; List a empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we mentioned, the types in the comments are automatically derived and we cannot control them. But
that is exactly what we want to do, and GADTs let us achieve that using the following syntax:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see it is very similar to our “rearranged” <code>List</code> definition above! What GADTs let us do
is write by ourselves types of data constructors (which were in the previous definition in the
comments), giving us control to specify them as we wish!</p>

<p>The difference in the syntax is that we have to add <code>where</code> after the type name and then
for each data constructor we specify its type signature.</p>

<p>Now we finally have the power to control <code>empty</code> type parameter (in <code>List a empty</code>)! We specified
that <code>End</code> will mark list as <code>Empty</code>, while <code>Cons</code> will mark it as <code>NonEmpty</code>. And this is exactly
what we wanted to do, because if we used <code>End</code> we know the list is empty, while if we used <code>Cons</code>
we know there is at least one element in it, which makes it non-empty.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action! Using it stays the same as without GADTs, just that this time there will
be <code>empty</code> type param which assumes an appropriate type:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span><span>)</span>
<span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>Num</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Wohoo, this works now! We see we can construct values of this type and we will always know whether
it is empty or not. <code>safeHead</code> function we defined above will work on these without any problems.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-just-use-smart-constructors-instead-of-gadts">Can we just use smart constructors instead of GADTs?</h3>

<p>One possible “downside” of GADTs is that it is a language extension we have to enable, thus making
our codebase a bit heavier (longer compilation time?) and less “standard”.</p>

<p>Sometimes we can avoid using GADTs with smart constructors. Let’s see what that is and how it would
work in this case.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Smart_constructors">Smart constructor</a> is simply a function that is used
to create a certain value instead of using its
data constructor directly. We typically do that (hide data constructors and expose smart
constructor functions) when we want to have extra control over the value creation. E.g. we want to
make some extra checks, or make sure an invalid value isn’t provided etc.</p>

<p>For example, we could provide a following smart constructor to create an empty list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>And this works! By defining the type signature of <code>createEmptyList</code> we made sure that <code>empty</code> will
always assume the type of <code>Empty</code> when this function is called. Since <code>End</code> has a type signature
<code>End :: List a empty</code>, we just “casted” type param <code>empty</code> here into a specific type.</p>

<p>Let’s try to do the same for the other data constructor, adding an element to the list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>addElemToList</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
<span>add…</span></code></pre></figure></article></div></div>

On the one hand, they've been denying it. On the others, on the other hand, they said it would be a bonus.</p>  <p>They said that come fall, and the second wave, we will be much better protected than our Scandinavian neighbours who had 10 times less deaths than we did in relation to population. But it became very clear once broad testing of antibodies was being done that there was nothing close to herd immunity.</p>  <p>And so, of course, they realize that they can't go for herd immunity. It's going to kill too many people. I mean, it's already killed almost 6,000 people in a population of 10 million. So they are no longer going for herd immunity, which doesn't mean that they're prepared to say, "we were wrong and we're going to change our recommendations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency of Sweden attends a news conference updating the country about COVID-19 on Oct. 9.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>At the centre of all of this, as we have followed what's going on in Sweden, is a man named </strong><strong>Anders&nbsp;Tegnel, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, and he seems to be a bit of a rock star in your country for the decisions he made. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tegnell-tattoo-idUSKCN2292G7">People have tattoos of him on their bodies.</a> So why is he so popular?</strong></p>  <p>This is a combination of factors, and this deserves a long discussion. Part of it, I'm sure, is that when there's a national crisis, people want to believe in authority.</p>  <p>The other aspect is that he has a very calming demeanour. Even when the numbers were going through the roof, he kept saying that we're flattening out, we're hitting the peak. He had a way of sounding extremely calming.</p>  <p>And also, you know, 90 per cent of the deaths were in the elderly, so …&nbsp;most people didn't see it.</p>  <p><strong>And what do you think of&nbsp;Anders&nbsp;Tegnel?</strong></p>  <p>I have no opinions about him personally, but I think he has not handled this well and he keeps on not handling this well.</p>  <p>Just as an example, Sweden is [one of the only countries],&nbsp;together with Somalia, Yemen, Eritrea, Syria, Greenland and some Pacific islands, who have still no recommendations for face masks whatsoever. So, you know, he hates face masks. He says they don't help. He keeps saying there's no support for them.</p>  <p>In the spring, that could have been a fair assumption. But by now, there's the studies are overwhelmingly showing the benefit of face masks, especially when it's used in the whole population, because it protects against someone who is sick.</p>  <p>So if everybody wears it, face masks are extremely efficient. But if only 50 per cent wear it, it's not at all sufficient. But he will not even say that they're good. I mean, you have to understand, in the Swedish hospitals, the doctors and nurses do not wear face masks.</p>    <p><strong>Well, it seems that [U.S. President] Donald Trump and the people around him would agree with Anders&nbsp;Tegnel.&nbsp;But the rest of the world, at least in countries where they have policies, they are not doing that. So somebody is right and somebody is wrong.</strong></p>  <p>The interesting thing is that in Sweden, we have a social democratic government dominated by the Social Democrats, so …&nbsp;it's more of a left-wing policy. Whereas in the rest of the world, it's very much a right-wing <em>laissez faire</em> policy to have herd immunity, or to try to have herd immunity, or to not wear face masks. Freedom, you know?</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>A sign promoting physical distancing is pictured in the Gallerian in Stockholm, Sweden, May 12.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>There was <a href="https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/">a freedom of information [request</a>, and] a bunch of emails that have been published by journalists in your country that show that Mr. Tegnel said that at one point that when it was suggested that 10 per cent of those who would get the disease would be the elderly and maybe they would die, 10 per cent might be "worth it," he apparently said. How much of the decisions are being driven by this idea that, well, maybe we have to keep Sweden moving, keeping the businesses open, and that's part of the motivation?</strong></p>  <p>They will never admit that the economy is an aspect. By the way, Sweden's economy has not fared any better than its Nordic neighbours. Rather, it's more at the bottom than at the top among our neighbours. So it hasn't benefited from it, and it has certainly not benefited from the herd immunity.</p>  <p><strong>Today we saw the announcement that citizens in Sweden should avoid places like shopping malls, museums, gyms, concerts, and avoid public transportation or visiting the elderly. So is there a shift perhaps in perception?</strong></p>  <p>There are policies. You know, it's not a completely<em> laissez faire</em>. I mean, people are advised to stay to work from home if they can. People are advised to not fill up the public transportation, the busses and the subways. There is still a maximum amount of people gathering of 50.</p>  <p>It's not a complete "let's live as normal" — but it's all recommendations and advice.</p>  <p>I would say that incrementally, Sweden has has gotten closer to other countries. I mean, we do a lot of testing now. We do, you know, about as much as Canada per capita. So it's not like in the spring, where nobody was tested outside of the hospital.</p>  <p>But it still is always too little.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

<![CDATA[Retool Funding Lesson: You Can Compete with Free When It's B2B]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Retool has announced that it raised $50M from Sequoia only 2 years after launch for what is essentially a front-end builder. While explaining to a non-developer friend how you can build a business selling something that countless web developers can cobble together out of free open source components, I accidentally busted this rhyme:</p>

<p>You can compete with free,
when it comes to B2B,
because for businesses
no-charge isn’t free</p>

<p>Look at it from a business’s point of view. Let’s say they pay a web developer $100 / hour. If it takes that dev 10 hours to piece together a front end from React, Bootstrap, and several tends of thousands of Javascript packages, that app cost them $1000. The fact that they don’t pay for the open source components is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Now imagine they could get the same app with 2 hours of effort using a tool that costs $100 / month. That $100 tool ends up costing them $-700. Paying up starts to sound like a pretty good deal</p>

<p>There are lots of examples of this economic story playing out if you look for them. Any development team can replicate the essential elements of Algolia with Apache Solr or Elasticsearch, but Algolia is going strong. Open source CMS options abound, but Contentful raised an $80M series E recently.</p>

<p>The big caveat here is that this <em>does not</em> apply in the B2C world. Consumers are famously blind to total cost of ownership, both monetary and intangible (like giving up any semblance of privacy for a ‘free’ navigation app). Free really is nigh on impossible to beat when you are targeting consumers. And the false economy of cheap-but-fragile junk is so compelling that finding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife">things that won’t break in a couple of years is an armchair sport</a>.</p>

<p>Next time your trying to think of a business idea, ask yourself this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are businesses dependent on that they aren’t paying for directly but they are paying dearly for in employee hours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever answer you come up with, it’s a million dollar idea.</p>

October 20, 2020 | https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>In this post, we will take a legacy application and improve its search
functionality. We will do this with only a few changes to the
application itself. Using a technique called change data capture (CDC)
we will listen for changes in a database and react to these
changes&nbsp;- write to a search index case. Before writing to the
search index, we will also enrich the data with a natural language
processing (NLP) step that extracts keywords from a text description.</p>
<p>We might want to use an external search index for various reasons,
especially:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to provide more feature-rich functionality than full-text search in a
relational database;</p></li>
<li><p>to scale the search independently of the database;</p></li>
<li><p>to add more functionality (keyword extraction) to the application
without
modifying it - making changes to a legacy application is sometimes
risky, or time-consuming, so taking this approach might be faster,
therefore cheaper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use Hazelcast Jet - an open-source stream processing system - and its CDC
module to read changes made to the application database for further
processing in a Jet pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Jet pipeline, we will enrich the data with an NLP mapping step.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the results to an Elasticsearch index, using an Elasticsearch
connector, <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/14/jet-42-is-released">released in Jet 4.2</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-architecture.png" alt="Architecture"></p>
<h2>The Application</h2>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring
PetClinic</a>
application. It is relatively well-known to many Java developers and is
rather similar to a typical enterprise application.</p>
<p>The application provides a management tool for managing pets, their
owners, and visits to vets. It allows searching for owners, but only
using the owner’s last name. We will make the search more feature-rich,
allowing us to search on first name, last name, pet names and keywords
extracted from descriptions of the visits.</p>
<p>First, let’s start a vanilla version of the application. Run the
following command to start MySQL database inside a Docker container, we
use the official MySQL image, which allows us to create a database for
the pet clinic application easily:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-mysql -it \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 mysql
</code></pre>
<p>Clone the pet clinic application source code from
<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic">Github</a> (this is a
fork of the official <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring PetClinic
repository</a> with a
branch containing the changes we will make later for your convenience).</p>
<pre><code>git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic.git
</code></pre>
<p>Start the pet clinic application from the command line by running the
following command:</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> spring-petclinic
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql
</code></pre>
<p>And wait for the following log message:</p>
<pre><code>2020-09-30 16:17:04.113  INFO 24847 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.s.petclinic.PetClinicApplication     : Started PetClinicApplication in 3.177 seconds (JVM running for 3.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owners in top-level menu</p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owner button to list all data</p>
<p>and you should see a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-spring-petclinic-list.png" alt="Spring PetClinic Sample Application"></p>
<h2>Prepare for Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>In order to stream the changes from the MySQL database we need to modify
certain settings and grant more permissions to the <code>petclinic</code> user.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start MySQL client, enter the <code>mysql</code>
password for the root user:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm --link petclinic-mysql:petclinic-mysql mysql mysql -hpetclinic-mysql -uroot -p
</code></pre>
<p>Run the following to grant privileges to the <code>petclinic</code> user to allow
listening to the database changes:</p>
<pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>USER</span> petclinic <span>IDENTIFIED</span> <span>WITH</span> mysql_native_password <span>BY</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> RELOAD <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>CLIENT</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>SLAVE</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ALTER USER</code> command changes the default authentication method to
one supported by the Jet CDC connector. The <code>GRANT</code> commands allow the
petclinic user to stream changes from the database in the same way as
during master-slave replication.</p>
<h2>Start Elasticsearch</h2>
<p>We want to enable full-text search across multiple fields, but not all
fields. With Elasticseach we need to create an index mapping that
copies fields into a single field, the field is then used for searching.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start Elasticsearch inside a docker
container:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-elastic \
  -e discovery.type=single-node \
  -e cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled=<span>false</span> \
  -p9200:9200 elasticsearch:7.9.2
</code></pre>
<p>Create an Elasticsearch index mapping by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -XPUT -H <span>"Content-type: application/json"</span> -d <span>'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "first_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "last_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.visits.keywords": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "search": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}'</span> http://localhost:9200/petclinic-index
</code></pre>
<p>The default setting of Elasticsearch analyzer is suitable for us. For
more elaborate configuration of the text analysis, you should look into
the Elasticsearch documentation or some other source.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet Job</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Petclinic and Elastic set-up and working, we can
start the data pump - a Jet job reading change events from MySQL
database and writing into the Elastic index.</p>
<p>A Jet job is a pipeline of steps that read, modify, aggregate or store
data items. The job definition is written in Java and packaged as a jar
file. The jar file is deployed to a Jet cluster, which takes care of the
execution, scaling, fail-over and other operational aspects.</p>
<p>The job consists of 4 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CDC Source connecting to MySQL database</p></li>
<li><p>A mapping step running the keyword extraction</p></li>
<li><p>A joining step reconstructing the document from change records from</p></li>
<li><p>different tables</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticsearch sink</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>CDC Source</h3>
<p>The configuration of the source is straightforward, just set the required
parameters:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>MySqlCdcSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>mysql</span><span>(</span><span>"mysql"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseAddress</span><span>(</span>databaseAddress<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePort</span><span>(</span>databasePort<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseUser</span><span>(</span>databaseUser<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePassword</span><span>(</span>databasePassword<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setClusterName</span><span>(</span>clusterName<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setTableWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic.owners"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.pets"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.visits"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use the source to read change events from MySQL into the pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>Pipeline</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Pipeline</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>StreamStage</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> allRecords <span>=</span> p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
                                        <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Keyword extraction</h3>
<p>The next step in the pipeline is to extract the keywords from the visit
description. We will use Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
algorithm, the implementation we use was originally published on
<a href="https://github.com/Linguistic/rake">Github</a>. The implementation is not
important for the demonstration, you could use any other Java library,
call a 3rd party service, e.g. via <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/how-tos/grpc">grpc</a> or use our
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/python">python integration</a>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>ServiceFactory</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>,</span> <span>Rake</span><span>&gt;</span></span> keywordService <span>=</span> <span>ServiceFactories</span><span>.</span><span>sharedService</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>context<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Rake</span><span>(</span><span>"en"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>mapUsingService</span><span>(</span>keywordService<span>,</span> <span>PetClinicIndexJob</span><span>::</span><span>enrichWithKeywords</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The method <code>enrichWithKeywords</code> simply passes the description field from
the change record to the keyword extraction service and sets the results
into the keywords field of the Visit instance.</p>
<p>It is a common pattern to enrich an item in a pipeline with more
information.  Hazelcast Jet works with POJOs in the pipeline, so you
need to somehow compose the original item and the enriching information.
One option is to use tuples.  This works for a small number of fields.
Another option would be to use a domain-specific object holding all the
information - e.g. the <code>keywords</code> field.  If you are on Java 14 or
newer, you might want to give the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359">Records preview
feature</a> a try.</p>
<h3>Joining</h3>
<p>Change data capture sends changes to the database as individual records
(represented by
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/javadoc/4.2/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/ChangeRecord.html">ChangeRecord</a>).
Each record represents a changed row in a database table. If a single
row is all that you need, you are good to go. You can see such example
in our <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/16/designing-evergreen-cache-cdc">Evergreen Cache blog
post</a>.  But having a
single row to work with is not always the case - often you need to
aggregate either multiple records from the same table or join records
from different tables into a single aggregate record.</p>
<p>In our case, we need to join 3 tables into a single document, which we
then index into Elasticsearch. To perform the joining we will use
<code>mapStateful</code> step. This can be performed either globally or partitioned
on a grouping key. If all your records share a common key it is always a
good idea to do the grouping by the key, because the mapping state is
then evenly distributed across all nodes and the mapping operation
parallelized.</p>
<p>Our visit record contains the pet ID but not the owner ID, in such case,
so we don’t have a single grouping key for all records. There are two
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perform the stateful mapping globally, which has the advantage of
having a single state - the joining logic is simpler and the pipeline
more straightforward. The obvious disadvantage is that such a solution
is not scalable because the state may not fit onto a single member and
must be performed by a single thread;</p></li>
<li><p>create two separate mapping steps - one grouped on the owner ID and
the other on the pet ID. This is a trade-off between simplicity and
scalability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several observations which hold for both implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the mapping state must cover all data from the beginning, unless there
is a domain-specific rule that would allow eviction of old items;</p></li>
<li><p>the records might arrive in any order, even if there is a foreign key
between the records in the database, the order is not guaranteed, this
is a property of CDC.</p></li>
<li><p>once the object is emitted from the join step, it must not be
modified, otherwise the later stages might see it in inconsistent
state, causing issues which are hard …</p></li></ul></span></p></div></div></div>

What is your background? what is your current position?</h2><p id="b291">Iâ€™ve always been interested in systems programming, and after obtaining my CS degree I got the opportunity to start a PhD at Ghent University, Belgium, right when Julia was first released around 2012. The language seemed intriguing, and since I wanted to gain some experience with LLVM, I decided to port some image processing research code from MATLAB and C++ to Julia. The goal was to match performance of the C++ version, but some of its kernels were implemented in CUDA Câ€¦ So obviously Julia needed a GPU back-end!</p><p id="7f14">That was easier said than done, of course, and much of my PhD was about implementing that back-end and (re)structuring the existing Julia compiler to facilitate these additional back-ends. Nowadays Iâ€™m at Julia Computing, where I still work on everything GPU-related.</p><h2 id="8f7f">What is JuliaGPU? What is the goal of the project?</h2><p id="43d9">JuliaGPU is the name we use to group GPU-related resources in Julia: Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU" rel="noopener">GitHub organization</a> where most packages are hosted, a <a href="https://juliagpu.org/" rel="noopener">website</a> to point the way for new users, we have <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/gitlab-ci" rel="noopener">CI infrastructure</a> for JuliaGPU projects, thereâ€™s a Slack channel and Discourse category, etc.</p><p id="ceaa">The goal of all this is to make it easier to use GPUs for all kinds of users. Current technologies often impose significant barriers to entry: CUDA is fairly tricky to install, C and C++ are not familiar to many users, etc. With the software we develop as part of the JuliaGPU organization, we aim to make it easy to use GPUs, without hindering the ability to optimize or use low-level features that the hardware has to offer.</p><h2 id="5da7">What is GPU computing? How important is it nowadays?</h2><p id="4de0">GPU computing means using the GPU, a device originally designed for graphics processing, to perform general-purpose computations. It has grown more important now that CPU performance is not improving as steadily as it used to. Instead, specialized devices like GPUs or FPGAs are increasingly used to improve the performance of certain computations. In the case of GPUs, the architecture is a great fit to perform highly-parallel applications. Machine learning networks are a good example of such parallel applications, and their popularity is one of the reasons GPUs have become so important.</p><h2 id="f596">Do you think Julia is an appropriate language to efficiently use GPU capabilities? Why?</h2><p id="775f">Juliaâ€™s main advantage is that the language was designed to be compiled. Even though the syntax is high-level, the generated machine code is<br>compact and has great performance characteristics (for more details, see <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla18b.pdf" rel="noopener">this paper</a>). This is crucial for GPU execution, where we are required to run native binaries and cannot easily (or efficiently) interpret code as is often required by other languageâ€™s semantics.</p><p id="b90b">Because weâ€™re able to directly compile Julia for GPUs, we can use almost all of the languageâ€™s features to build powerful abstractions. For example, you can define your own types, use those in GPU arrays, compose that with existing abstractions like lazy "Transpose" wrappers, access those on the GPU while benefiting from automatic bounds-checking (if needed), etc.</p><h2 id="824e">From a Python programmer perspective, how does CUDA.jl compare to PyCUDA? Are their functionalities equivalent?</h2><p id="cf3f">PyCUDA gives the programmer access to the CUDA APIs, with high-level Python functions that are much easier to use. CUDA.jl provides the same, but in Julia. The `hello world` from PyCUDAâ€™s home page looks almost identical in Julia:</p><pre><span id="a986">using CUDA</span><span id="03e4">function multiply_them(dest, a, b)<br> i = threadIdx().x<br> dest[i] = a[i] * b[i]<br> return<br>end</span><span id="9e7d">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="5833">dest = similar(a)<br>@cuda threads=400 multiply_them(dest, a, b)</span><span id="1372">println(dest-a.*b)</span></pre><p id="396f">Thereâ€™s one very big difference: "multiply_them" here is a function written in Julia, whereas PyCUDA uses a kernel written in CUDA C. The reason is straightforward: Python is not simple to compile. Of course, projects like Numba prove that it is very much possible to do so, but in the end those are separate compilers that try to match the reference Python compilers as closely as possible. With CUDA.jl, we integrate with that reference compiler, so itâ€™s much easier to guarantee consistent semantics and follow suit when the language changes (for more details,<br>refer to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03112" rel="noopener">this paper</a>).</p><h2 id="5cf6">Are the packages in the JuliaGPU organization targeted to experienced programmers only?</h2><p id="6590">Not at all. CUDA.jl targets different kinds of (GPU) programmers. If you are confident writing your own kernels, you can do so, while using all of the low-level features CUDA GPUs have to offer. But if you are new to the world of GPU programming, you can use high-level array operations that use existing kernels in CUDA.jl. For example, the above element-wise multiplication could just as well be written as:</p><pre><span id="9c1f">using CUDA</span><span id="476a">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="efdf">dest = a .* b</span></pre><h2 id="4c26">Is it necessary to know how to code in CUDA.jl to take full advantage of GPU computing in Julia?</h2><p id="208b">Not for most users. Julia has a powerful language of generic array operations ("map", "reduce", "broadcast", "accumulate", etc) which can be applied to all kinds of arrays, including GPU arrays. That means you can often re-use your codebase developed for the CPU with CUDA.jl (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997818310123" rel="noopener">this paper</a> shows some powerful examples). Doing so often requires minimal changes: changing the array type, making sure you use array operations instead of for loops, etc.</p><p id="672d">Itâ€™s possible you need to go beyond this style of programming, e.g., because your application doesnâ€™t map cleanly onto array operations, to use specific GPU features, etc. In that case, some basic knowledge about CUDA and the GPU programming model is sufficient to write kernels in CUDA.jl.</p><h2 id="1a33">How is the experience of coding a kernel in CUDA.jl in comparison to CUDA C and how transferable is the knowledge to one another?</h2><p id="6a08">Itâ€™s very similar, and thatâ€™s by design: We try to keep the kernel abstractions in CUDA.jl close to their CUDA C counterparts such that the programming environment is familiar to existing GPU programmers. Of course, by using a high-level source language thereâ€™s many quality-of-life improvements. You can allocated shared memory, for example, statically and dynamically as in CUDA C, but instead of a raw pointers we use an N-dimensional array object you can easily index. An example from the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-shared-memory-cuda-cc/" rel="noopener">NVIDIA developer blog</a>:</p><pre><span id="ef8a">__global__ void staticReverse(int *d, int n)<br>{<br> __shared__ int s[64];<br> int t = threadIdx.x;<br> int tr = n-t-1;<br> s[t] = d[t];<br> __syncthreads();<br> d[t] = s[tr];<br>}</span></pre><p id="9cb0">The CUDA.jl equivalent of this kernel looks very familiar, but uses array objects instead of raw pointers:</p><pre><span id="996c">function staticReverse(d)<br> s = @cuStaticSharedMem(Int, 64)<br> t = threadIdx().x<br> tr = length(d)-t+1<br> s[t] = d[t]<br> sync_threads()<br> d[t] = s[tr]<br> return<br>end</span></pre><p id="9a14">Using array objects has many advantages, e.g. multi-dimensional is greatly simplified and we can just do "d[i,j]". But itâ€™s also safer, because these accesses are bounds checked:</p><pre><span id="3d65">julia&gt; a = CuArray(1:64)<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> â‹®<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64</span><span id="0d9c">julia&gt; @cuda threads=65 staticReverse(a)<br>ERROR: a exception was thrown during kernel execution.<br>Stacktrace:<br> [1] throw_boundserror at abstractarray.jl:541</span></pre><p id="c17a">Bounds checking isnâ€™t free, of course, and once weâ€™re certain our code is correct we can add an "@inbounds" annotation to our kernel and get the high-performance code we expect:</p><pre><span id="6846">julia&gt; @device_code_ptx @cuda threads=64 staticReverse(a)<br>.visible .entry staticReverse(.param .align 8 .b8 d[16]) {<br> .reg .b32 %r&lt;2&gt;;<br> .reg .b64 %rd&lt;15&gt;;<br> .shared .align 32 .b8 s[512];</span><span id="09c9">mov.b64 %rd1, d;<br> ld.param.u64 %rd2, [%rd1];<br> ld.param.u64 %rd3, [%rd1+8];<br> mov.u32 %r1, %tid.x;<br> cvt.u64.u32 %rd4, %r1;<br> mul.wide.u32 %rd5, %r1, 8;<br> add.s64 %rd6, %rd5, -8;<br> add.s64 %rd7, %rd3, %rd6;<br> ld.global.u64 %rd8, [%rd7+8];<br> mov.u64 %rd9, s;<br> add.s64 %rd10, %rd9, %rd6;<br> st.shared.u64 [%rd10+8], %rd8;<br> bar.sync 0;<br> sub.s64 %rd11, %rd2, %rd4;<br> shl.b64 %rd12, %rd11, 3;<br> add.s64 %rd13, %rd9, %rd12;<br> ld.shared.u64 %rd14, [%rd13+-8];<br> st.global.u64 [%rd7+8], %rd14;<br> ret;<br>}</span><span id="4489">julia&gt; a<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 64<br> 63<br> 62<br> â‹®<br> 3<br> 2<br> 1</span></pre><p id="3cee">Tools like "@device_code_ptx" make it easy for an experienced developer to inspect generated code and ensure the compiler does what he wants.</p><h2 id="164a">Why does having a compiler have such an impact in libraries like CUDA.jl? (How was the process of integrating it to the Julia compiler?)</h2><p id="e360">Because we have a compiler at our disposal, we can rely on higher-order functions and other generic abstractions that specialize based on the arguments that users provide. That greatly simplifies our library, but also gives the user very powerful tools. As an example, we have carefully implemented a `mapreduce` function that uses shared memory, warp intrinsics, etc to perform a high-performance reduction. The implementation is generic though, and will automatically re-specialize (even at run time) based on the arguments to the function:</p><pre><span id="9da7">julia&gt; mapreduce(identity, +, CuArray([1,2,3]))<br>6</span><span id="c680">julia&gt; mapreduce(sin, *, CuArray([1.1,2.2,3.3]))<br>-0.11366175839582586</span></pre><p id="52e8">With this powerful `mapreduce` …</p></div></div></section></div>

<h2><strong>A waterfall of old-schoolness&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p>I worked as a developer using Waterfall for exactly 9 months. I was 22 years old and it was my first programmer job and first corporate environment. This place was old school. Like suit-wearing, personal cubicle type old school. Our CEO would hold all-hands meetings where everyone was required to stand the whole time and he would call people up to give speeches at random because he believed everyone should be good at public speaking.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption>22 year old Dan was NOT good at public speaking 🙂&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>







<p>At one offsite event, the CEO designated me as the company Complaint Manager. During the 4-day event employees were directed to give me their complaints. Of course my friends dropped anonymous and hilarious complaints because they knew that, at the end of each day, I was going to be called up to the stage to repeat back all of the complaints. What?!? Super old school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One time, I was sent to work at a client’s office for a week, just so they could visibility see my team working on their project. And I mean that in the most literal sense. We didn’t have any meetings or recent project updates, they just wanted to make sure we were actually working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I never saw a single line of my code in production during my 9 months I spent working there. I actually remember learning that my project was finally being sent to QA for testing the week I left. After 9 months. Old. School.</p>



<p>But I didn’t know any better at the time. I hadn’t heard of Agile yet, and no one told me we were doing Waterfall. Luckily I got out of there and found a job at Cloudlock where I learned about Agile and eventually worked my way up to VP of Engineering. But I’ll never forget my first year as a Waterfall programmer.</p>



<p>So does methodology matter? Absolutely. But…&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>We do agile… But</strong></h2>







<p>If you ask a software developer&nbsp; what methodology they follow, 95% of us will say we do agile…but, usually followed by some version of Scrum or Kanban. While this sounds like a worldwide consensus, the reality is that every dev team I’ve worked on or managed has had a different development process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During my time as VP of Engineering at Cloudlock, I looked after 75 developers across 5 teams. Each team had their own unique process. There were team leads who had been working in software development for 25+ years and others that had <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/">just gotten promoted</a>. The younger leads liked having a more strict process to follow, whereas the more senior managers had a process they had customized over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of those teams built amazing software even though their methods differed per team. Why? Because software development is not a zero sum game. Just because one team is successful using Agile Scrum doesn’t mean another team will be less successful using Agile Kanban. Or Scrumban. Or SAFe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a lot of options out there so, instead of focusing on methodology, I find it makes sense to start with what you’re trying to do and work backwards.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>A bespoke development process – The GigSmart dev team&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p><em>“You got rid of teams?!?”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I recently caught up with my friend Chris Downard, VP of Engineering at GigSmart, to chat about dev methodology changes in light of current events. I was completely taken aback when the first thing he said to me was that he just got rid of teams in his engineering department.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>

<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>I’m not personally strict about following this or that development method, but getting rid of teams felt a little extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris: “It naturally evolved that way. Because of this remote culture that we adopted very rapidly, we just found that the back end people tended to support each other on their backend tickets; whether or not it was on their direct team or a direct feature they were working on. They were helping each other, committing to each other’s code, etc. So we kept the team thing going up until last month, and we were measuring that way, so we just eliminated it because it didn’t make sense anymore.”</p>



<p>Getting rid of teams works for Chris for two reasons. He runs a small-ish team of 14 developers and the team uses a Kanban style framework. If there are 3 or 4 features in flight, each team member is assigned to one as their dominant project, but they’re all on one team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the classic Scrum ceremonies are still followed, but he’s working on making them more effective as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do one large standup and it takes us 15 minutes to get through. People give their standup updates in order based on their dominant feature. So the first set of people who go, are the ones who are working on Feature A, and the second group that goes are all working on Feature B.”</p>



<p>On top of no teams and restructuring their daily, Chris says they work in sprints but use a Kanban board to increase speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The product team loves that because if they decide that something is suddenly really hot because sales has run into this or that, we can address it immediately.”</p>

<h3><strong>Why does GigSmart work this way?&nbsp;</strong></h3>







<ul><li>Chris believes in continuous improvement based on team feedback.</li></ul>







<p>When he runs sprint retros, anything that engineering brings up that isn’t working, they have a conversation about. He brings in product and they chat about ways to make it better, and then they test it. And if it doesn’t work, he readjusts, and tries to fix it. Since he started at GigSmart, there hasn’t been a 4 week period where their process has stayed the same.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="2"><li>GigSmart’s most valuable outcome is speed.</li></ul>







<p>The methodology, process, or ethos that drives your team needs to be purpose built to achieve the outcome you want. At GigSmart they’re defined outcome was high quality and speed. As an on-demand staffing platform, they choose to prioritize hotfixes and bugs. Other companies might need to be more predictable, quality-driven, stable, consistent, etc. based on their business type and needed outcome.</p>







<ul start="3"><li>GigSmart is culture-driven&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>“Build better, more engaged engineering teams… That’s probably what my actual official job description is. So culture really matters.” <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/our-dev-culture-is-based-on-bushido-samurai-code-my-interview-with-the-vp-of-engineering-at-gigsmart/">Chris and GigSmart CTO,&nbsp; Jason Waldrip, modeled their team cultural values</a> on the ancient samurai code of Bushido. 8 values that they’ve written down and strive to live and work by every day.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="4"><li>GigSmart is data-driven</li></ul>







<p>Measuring is not enough, you have to measure with a purpose. You get what you measure. Everyone is familiar with this saying. Chris takes it a step further and actually encourages the team to look data about how they work in all of their day-to-day practices and ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defining his company’s most valuable outcome and listening to his developers, Chris has created a development process that is bespoke to his team today. Just like a custom tailored suit, his development method cannot be easily used by another company. It had to be made up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Make up your own dev methodology: 4 guiding ideas</strong></h2>

<p>Sometimes I just like building my own thing from the ground up. It’s why I started <a href="https://linearb.io/">LinearB.</a> Do you NEED to create your own development method? Definitely not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s much easier to start with Scrum or Kanban and adapt from there. But times, they are a changin’, and maybe this is a good year to go through the exercise of redefining how you work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we started full-time remote back in March, my co-founder, Ori Keren, and I did just that. We created <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/asynchronous-development/">Asynchronous Development</a>, a development methodology designed around async communication and purpose-built for hybrid remote teams. It’s our favorite parts of Agile. A little bit of Scrum. A lot of what Ori and I learned over the years that really works for us. And a big dose of where we think the future of software development teamwork is headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hundreds of teams are now following the Async Dev methodology. If we can make up our own dev methodology, you can too!&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Here’s 4 guiding ideas that will help you make up your own dev methodology</strong></p>







<ol><li><strong>Know your “why”&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>







<p>What matters to you? If it’s aligning to your company’s most important business goals, do you&nbsp; know what they are? Start-ups tend to want lots of new features as quickly as possible. More mature companies like predictability and quality. Find out and work backwards from there.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="2"><li><strong>Don’t be dogmatic</strong></li></ol>







<p>Forget about the rules and just ask yourself… “How do we really want to work?” Ask your people. Especially your out-of-the-box thinkers. The more crazy ideas you throw in the mix, the more discussion you’ll create and the more you’ll end up with something that is really bespoke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the Agile manifesto says face-to-face communication is the most efficient way to transfer information. Is that still true for your team?</p>







<ol start="3"><li><strong>Retro your current process</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong><br></strong>Ask… “Why are we doing all of these things we do every day?” Do you really need a daily stand-up? Do you really need two week sprints? Are you realy getting value from them? The answer may be yes. But I bet if your team will have a lot of ideas of how they could be more dev-friendly and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="4"><li><strong>Bring data to the conversation&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>

			<p><em>Abstract: A few weeks ago, Orca Security published a comparison between the Orca Cloud Security Platform and a few other cloud security tools—including a&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">comparison with Palo Alto Networks Prisma</a>. In response, Palo Alto Networks sent a <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cease and desist letter</a>, demanding the comparison be removed immediately. Here is my response. I urge you to see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnqJTEi6ynvsGkSJHYeEmhz6_NfzKgbf">the videos in question</a>&nbsp;and if you, like me, believe the cybersecurity community deserves transparency and vendors shouldn’t be allowed to prevent publishing reviews or benchmarks via legal threats, then please share this post. You can also leave your own comments down below.</em></p>
<p><strong>To: Palo Alto Networks</strong></p>
<p><strong>CC: The cybersecurity community</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: The Cybersecurity community demands transparency, not legal threats&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Security has always been about transparency. The concept of security by obscurity was frowned upon as early as 1851—even before the invention of electricity—when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Charles_Hobbs">Alfred Hobbs</a>, a Massachusetts-based locksmith, demonstrated how then state-of-the-art locks could be picked. He explained that exposing the information would make the public more secure, as rogues already knew the deficiencies. The public needed to be educated, and he’d pursue better locks. Today’s locks are more advanced, but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity community preaches about many products. All come with their own advantages and disadvantages, capabilities, and limitations. I believe that the only way practitioners can choose the tools that fit their environments best is by viewing factual evidence—not by relying solely on marketing materials. This is why we launched our&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/cloud-security-solutions/">Cloud Security Punch-Out! Series</a>, where we deploy a few tools—including Orca Security—on the exact same environment and share the results with viewers who deserve to see them. I urge you to take&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">a look at the one we did with Palo Alto Networks;</a>&nbsp;as you’ll see we don’t hide those areas where Palo Alto Networks shines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Palo Alto Networks is now trying to use legal threats to prevent us from publishing&nbsp;these video&nbsp;reviews. In <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its letter</a>, Palo Alto Networks does not point to any factual inaccuracies in the reviews of its products’ performance. Instead, it premises its threats on flimsy, boilerplate contract terms that prohibit reviews and comparisons of its products and hollow trademark allegations purporting that Palo Alto Networks is sponsoring the videos.</p>
<p>It’s outrageous that the world’s largest cybersecurity vendor (its products being used by over 65,000 organizations according to its website), believes that its users aren’t entitled to share any benchmark or performance comparison of its products. According to its boilerplate contract terms that prohibit “disclosing, publishing, or otherwise making publicly available any benchmark, performance, or comparison tests” of its products, you’re in violation even if you publish the results of an internal comparison of Palo Alto Networks against other products as part of your procurement process. The same goes for the hundreds of Palo Alto Networks reviews on various sites that include G2 Crowd, Capterra, and Gartner Peer Insights. It means that only benchmarks approved by Palo Alto Networks can be published.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks appears oblivious to the fact that the New York Attorney General’s office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/2003579195misc2d3841519">sued and won an injunction</a>&nbsp;against McAfee from enforcing its contractual restrictions against publishing reviews or comparisons of its products without its consent more than 17 years ago. In enacting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45b">Consumer Review Fairness Act</a>, Congress has also prohibited businesses from including contract terms that prohibit consumers from reviewing products or services they purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>Palo Alto Networks, do you think your products are flawless or that the bad guys will follow along, not openly talking about products’ deficiencies? If the answer is no to both, then why resort to legal threats to remove such benchmarks and comparisons? I refuse to accept a world where any vendor believes it has the right to prevent the free flow of information, and control which product reviews are made publicly available.</p></blockquote>
<p>I urge you to make your products better and focus your marketing efforts on demonstrating that, rather than throwing away money on ill-conceived gag efforts. Such action doesn’t benefit anyone. If you believe we missed something in our test, then tell us so we can make adjustments—we’ll happily integrate your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>We could contract an objective third party to conduct additional tests. You could conduct your own tests with Palo Alto Networks and Orca Security’s products, then let the audience see and decide for themselves. All such actions would be far more beneficial to the industry, permitting both companies to learn and improve our products for the sake of customers.</p>
<p>As we all recently learned too well,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/sunlight-inactivates-the-airborne-virus-that-causes-covid19">sunlight is the best disinfectant</a>. The cybersecurity community deserves better than a vendor’s lack of transparency while wielding dubious legal methods. Palo Alto Networks is the worlds’ largest cybersecurity vendor; with great power comes great responsibility. Your products are great—but nothing is perfect, and the public should have free access to all of the facts.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
Avi Shua, CEO and Co-Founder<br>
Orca Security</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I’ve been in and around eng hiring for the past 13 years, as an engineer, a recruiter, and a founder of a technical recruiting marketplace (interviewing.io). Over the course of those 13 years, I’ve become increasingly disgruntled at the state of hiring, and now I’m mad enough to write this blog post.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever been on either end of the table, you’re probably mad at the state of hiring, too. Whether you have given it a lot of thought or whether you just feel it deep down, something about the whole process feels off.</p>



<p>But we’ve been doing it this way for so long that we probably take much of how hiring works as gospel, and it’s really hard to tease apart all the different components of the process and examine why they are the way they are. In this post, I’d like to challenge many of the things we assume about hiring, and, perhaps most importantly, I’d like to lay out my platonic ideal for how eng hiring should work. It’s a simple axiom, really:</p>



<p><em>It should be easy for smart people to talk to other smart people.</em></p>



<p>Or, another way to put it … if I’m a good engineer, it should be easy for me to talk to a hiring manager at a company I might be interested in, at a time of my choosing. But that’s simply not possible today. Despite the refrain that we’re in a candidate’s market and that there’s a shortage of good candidates, which should mean that candidates should have the power to call the shots, today’s hiring process couldn’t be further removed from this ideal. And it’s not just broken for a specific type of candidate. It’s broken for <em>everyone.</em></p>



<p>If you’re reading this, you might be an engineering manager, a senior engineer with stellar credentials, a recent bootcamp grad, an engineer from a background traditionally underrepresented in tech, or some combination of these. <strong>What’s truly messed up about the status quo is that, regardless of which of these groups you fall into, your journey will be unnecessarily unpleasant. Though the degree of unpleasantness will not always be the same, it’s not about race, seniority, pedigree, or gender … or even which side of the table you’re on. Hiring, in its current incarnation, is broken for everybody.</strong></p>



<p>Why? Let us go then, you and I, into the bowels of the status quo.</p>



<h2>A candidate and a hiring manager, never the twain shall meet</h2>



<p>Let’s say that I’m a competent generalist engineer who looks good on paper, and I’m thinking that it’s time to look for a new job. What happens next? The idea of having to mount a full-on job search is so daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could try some job boards to see which companies are out there. But what would I filter on? I know a lot of programming languages but am not set on having to work in a specific one. How can I tell if I’ll hit it off with the team? I’m applying via a job board to a position I know next to nothing about — will anyone even respond?</p>



<p>Suppose I find some companies where I might want to work. If I’m lucky enough to know someone there, I’ll have to get them to refer me, even though that may not actually do much to speed things along. And if I don’t know anyone there, applying will be an exhausting long shot. Odds are no one will look at my application, and having to redo my resume — or worse, write cover letters — seems like the most tedious kind of busywork.</p>



<p>I guess I can always dig through the recruiter spam I’ve gotten. But do those recruiters still work at the company? If they do, how long will it actually take to get into the process?</p>



<p>Breaking character for a moment, a friend of mine recently got this recruiting email from Google, who has elevated gaslighting to an art form: somehow the fact that it takes two months to get through their process has become a <em>selling point.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="319" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-450x191.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-768x327.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>Once I do get into the process, why do I have to endure the same intro call ten times with different recruiters who can’t tell me anything about what I’d be working on at any level of depth?</p>



<p>Do I join some platform, create a profile that I copy-paste everywhere (with writing that was just as painful as the aforementioned resume/cover letter) and sort of hope that decent companies contact me … only to have to begin the same recruiter calls over and over again, as above?</p>



<p>Will I have to take some quizzes that drill me on obscure syntax or make me solve toy problems that have no bearing on my engineering ability before I even get to have the aforementioned inane conversation with a recruiter?</p>



<p><strong>If I’m actually good at my job, why can’t I just set up some conversations with companies I think are cool and see if it’s a fit? Why do I have to subject myself and others to an endless parade of vapid conversations and the inevitable busywork that precedes them?</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the truth. Even if I look good on paper and am well-connected, hiring still sucks because of all the noise, uncertainty, and time wasted … but at least I have options. They might not be exactly the right options for me, but at least they exist. On the other hand, if I’m an engineer without a pedigree or a network, my choices are extremely limited, no matter how good I am. Recruiters aren’t reaching out to me, I’m not well-networked enough to have friends refer me, and I <em>definitely </em>don’t hear back when I apply.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s take a look at the other side of the table. Let’s say I’m an eng manager who needs to hire more competent generalists for my team. Having worked as both an eng manager and a recruiter, I can tell you that what happens next isn’t particularly inspiring.</p>



<p>As an eng manager, I sit down with a recruiter and try to explain what I’m looking for. Nine times out of ten, I want a <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/">smart person who can get shit done</a>. But, after a farcical game of telephone, somehow those criteria get warped into years of experience with a specific technology or requirements about where the candidate went to school. I also end up with an uninspired, sterile job description that fails to capture the imagination of any candidates who might unwittingly stumble upon it.</p>



<p><strong>My recruiter then goes to any number of sourcing tools of which LinkedIn Recruiter is the ubiquitous, lackluster market leader. They type in keywords I didn’t ask for and filter on credentials I don’t care about to come up with the same homogenous list of candidates every other recruiter at every other tech company is chasing.</strong></p>



<p>They then contact these candidates en masse with generic copy about my team and the hard problems we’re solving. They celebrate single-digit response rates and spend the minimal time left over to give a cursory glance at candidates applying directly.</p>



<h2>Why is hiring broken?</h2>



<p>So therein lies the ineffectual dance. This is the process we’ve come to accept. As far as I can tease out, the axioms that underlie today’s recruiting best practices go something like this (some of these were told to me verbatim when I was starting out as a recruiter, even):</p>



<ol><li><strong>Thou shalt not engage with active candidates. After all, in this market, strong candidates aren’t looking. Good recruiters build relationships so that when a good candidate does decide to enter the market, the recruiter is there, behind the next doorway, ready to spring!</strong></li><li><strong>Engineering time is expensive, so it’s critical to do as much top-of-funnel filtering as possible to make sure that it’s spent on the right candidates.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Are these axioms wrong? The sad truth is … not really. I’ve written in a <a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/the-unvarnished-unbundled-guide-to-hiring-tools/">previous post about how market forces rule everything around me</a>, and recruiting best practices are no exception. In an economy with a surplus of jobs and a shortage of talent, it follows that the best talent is going to be harder to find, engineering time will be expensive, and recruiters in their current incarnation are, dare I say it, a necessary evil. <sup><a href="#footnote_0_2455" id="identifier_0_2455" title="From what you’ve read up until this point, you might think that I hate recruiters and find them useless. Not so, dear reader! I hate bad recruiters. And, unfortunately, most of them are bad. What’s sad is that the good ones, instead of spending time on tasks for which they’re uniquely qualified and well-suited, are instead stuck at the top of the funnel sourcing engineers whose qualifications they don’t have the domain expertise to evaluate and selling them on roles they don’t have the domain expertise to describe. The best recruiters I’ve worked with are singularly amazing at shepherding candidates through the process, tirelessly stewarding a company’s employer brand, advising hiring managers on the best ways to close, keeping an analytical eye on the funnel to identify issues before they even arise, and much more.">1</a></sup></p>



<p>The data supports our current world view. According to Lever (one of the two application tracking systems widely used by startups, Greenhouse is the other), here’s a breakdown of how many candidates from each source it takes to make a hire. Note that here, larger numbers are bad — for many companies, internal referrals are the best source and inbound applications are the worst.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-450x225.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-768x384.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking at this data, you can see why recruiters simply ignore online applications. The same dynamics also apply to platforms such as AngelList — like any jobs board, it’s noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage (e.g., juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship).</p>



<p>As for the value of eng time, guarding it carefully isn’t exactly wrong either. In fact, if you look at what a typical hiring process looks like today, you’ll see that most of the time spent is by engineers conducting interviews.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hiring process stage</strong></th><th>Who does it?</th><th>How long does it take?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resume review</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>10-30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Recruiter screen</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>45 min</td></tr><tr><td>Technical phone screen</td><td>Engineer</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Eng portion</td><td>Engineer</td><td>6 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Recruiter portion</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Offer</td><td>Recruiter OR Eng mgr</td><td>1 hour</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Engineering salaries are high, so given that most of the time spent on a single candidate is with engineers, it’s <em>rational</em> to put some recruiter gates at the top of the funnel to protect eng time. The idea is that recruiters will effectively screen out most candidates and only pass on the most promising ones to the eng team.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, when you look at an actual typical <em>funnel</em>, you’ll see that despite attempts to gate the top with recruiters filtering resumes and making intro calls, it’s not really working. Below is what a typical funnel looks like.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="89" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-750x89.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-750x89.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-450x53.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-768x91.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>If you <a href="https://blog.interviewing.io/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do the math</a> and look at how many hours are spent — not per candidate but per hire (more useful because hires are ultimately what we want) — you’ll see that despite attempts to save eng time, recruiters spend roughly 15 hours a hire <sup><a href="#footnote_1_2455" id="identifier_1_2455" title="If we add in time to review resumes, it’s an extra five hours (at most).">2</a></sup> and engineers spend about 40.

        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1316098702260359168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

          <p>If you’re like me, when you start coding something new, you’re probably finding yourself working with JSON.  Maybe you’re using Node.js or Python or any other dynamic language that uses JSON-like data natively or maybe you’re working with data that you’re pulling or serving from REST APIs. Either way, increasingly it seems like everything is ending up in JSON at some point.  Most of the time, this isn’t a problem, it’s just the way that we build software these days.  There’s just one problem, and that’s that Cassandra isn’t particularly good at JSON…</p>

<p>To double-click on that, the problem isn’t the JSON data format itself, although Cassandra doesn’t make JSON easy, it’s the way most devs use JSON when we’re building our apps.  Iterative development means that plans change.  The user registration form now needs a couple of more fields and the front-end dev went ahead and added them.  That API I’m calling returns some extra data.   Welcome to the loosely coupled world, it’s all fun and games until my app needs to send it to the database.</p>

<p>In the early days, Cassandra actually made this pretty simple to do, but as the project matured and added features like enterprise-friendly SQL-like query languages and better indexing, that meant that we needed the database to enforce a schema.  Over time, it became harder and harder to use Cassandra for things like JSON and other document-oriented use cases.</p>

<p>Enter Stargate - if there’s one thing you should know about the Stargate team it’s that our personal mission is to make Cassandra easy for every developer.  Figuring out how to give Javascript devs native JSON support without having to give up any of the reliability and scalability goodness of Cassandra was a challenge we couldn’t pass up.</p>

<p>This idea gave rise to the Stargate <strong>Documents API</strong>, which lets most Cassandra distros (Cassandra 3.11, Cassandra 4.0, and DataStax Enterprise 6.8), work with JSON through a REST API.</p>

<h2 id="api-features-and-design">API features and design</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/tjake">Jake Luciani</a> and I started to create the bones of this API, we realized that Cassandra is nothing like a document store. Expressing data as rows is straightforward, but expressing trees of JSON data is really not. In addition, mapping that JSON data onto a table managed by Stargate and keeping both writes and reads reasonably fast adds an additional layer of complexity.</p>

<p>From here, we mapped out three main design components in order for this work:
Modeling Documents in Cassandra
Handling Reads and Writes
Figuring out Deletes</p>

<p>The rest of this blog walks through how we approached each design and resolved some hiccups along the way.
Modeling Documents in Cassandra with Document Shredding</p>

<p>The first thing that we had to decide  was the schema of the managed table that backs a document collection. Due to some great discussions with some Cassandra specialists, it was decided that when a user creates a document, a table will be created with a statement of the form:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>key</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>p0</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>…</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>N</span><span>]</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>bool_value</span> <span>boolean</span><span>,</span>
  <span>txt_value</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span>
  <span>bl_value</span> <span>double</span><span>,</span> <span>leaf</span> <span>text</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point is where we had to solve an unbounded data modeling problem. Because any JSON document that has a depth of [N] or less can be added to this table, each value in the JSON will get stored as a row in the table. So if I wanted to represent a document called “x” that has the JSON:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The document would be “shredded” into rows looking like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For data with an array, such as:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>"d"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>there would be two rows, like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>[0]</td>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Array elements are stored with square braces in the column.</p>

<h3 id="handling-reads-and-writes">Handling Reads and Writes</h3>

<p>The next problem that arose was that naïvely, updates to a document could require reading the document from the database, seeing what modification would have to be made, and then writing the updated data.  This “read-before-write” process is a notorious source of performance and consistency issues in most data stores.</p>

<p>Therefore, we resolved to avoid doing any read-before-write operations at all costs.</p>

<p>An interesting implementation detail that came up is that when you write some data to a document, the resulting write operation is just a simple batch with some inserts and deletes. In some cases, this can cause the document rows in the database to show two different states for the same JSON field.</p>

<p><em>And, upon reading the rows out, the Documents API reconciles conflicting information by accepting the data that has a later Cassandra write time (much like Cassandra itself!).</em></p>

<p>This allows us to write data really quickly while not compromising too much in reads either, as the reconciliation does not happen often and is also quite fast. It also gives us a very important core principle to our basic write and read operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every write to a single document is a single batch of statements, and</li>
  <li>Every read from a single document is a single SELECT statement.</li>
</ol>

<p>So writes and reads are squared away - but what about deletes?</p>

<h3 id="figuring-out-deletes">Figuring out Deletes</h3>

<p>Because of the distributed nature of the database, a deletion in Cassandra actually is very similar to an insert, but instead a “tombstone” is written at a particular write time to signify the death of a row.</p>

<p>Rest in peace… almost</p>

<p>One very real danger here is that Cassandra may eventually crash with a “Tombstone Overwhelming” error as tombstones accrue. Cassandra periodically (the frequency here depends on your compaction strategy and/or cluster load) does a compaction operation to remove tombstones and alleviate this pressure, so the only way to avoid overwhelming Cassandra is to make sure that the frequency of deletions is low enough.</p>

<p>This poses a problem for the Document API specifically because of arrays. Let’s walk through this one.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have an array at some key that is of length 100000. If you then issue a replace operation (via a PUT) and decide to replace that array with some other value, then all of those 100000 rows would be deleted, causing 100000 tombstones to be written.  This is an enormous number of tombstones to be written in one operation, and if you do that just a few more times, Cassandra will likely crash or get super slow. So the structure of the data in each table needed one last major modification.</p>

<p>We said before that array paths are stored in the database with square brackets; for example the element at index 0 would be stored as [0]. That would mean a deletion of 100000 elements would look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>'[0]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[1]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[2]'</span><span>,</span> <span>…</span><span>,</span> <span>'[99999]'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Causing 100000 tombstones to be written. Instead of doing that, we decided to pad all array elements with leading zeros, so the element at index 0 would instead be represented as [000000], and the element at index 99999 would be [099999]. Doing this allowed us to change the deletion statement to:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>'[000000]'</span> <span>and</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>'[999999]'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Which causes only a single so-called “range” tombstone to be written, instead of 100000 cell tombstones (note that greater and less than works on strings in Cassandra and will compare lexically). It also relaxes the array length limit to one million elements, which is pretty neat! The time series below shows how the old vs. new implementation might behave, if you performed compactions every week:</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png"></p>

<p>So the new strategy is just safer for deletions; it would require an incredibly large amount of deletion with the new strategy to even come close to the theoretical tombstone limits!</p>

<h2 id="preliminary-look-at-api-performance">Preliminary Look at API performance</h2>

<p>⚠️ Before starting on this section, we want to mention that benchmarking is a great tool, but does not necessarily represent how a system will behave under real load, out in the wild. We also haven’t done comparisons on the same hardware with other document stores…yet. Alright, let’s get to it!</p>

<p>In order to test that the Document API is reasonably fast, we ran a benchmark test using a single Cassandra storage node and a single Stargate node (Stargate is the API that contains the Documents API). We then ran two different benchmarks, one that uses HTTP GET to repeatedly get random paths in a document, and another that performs HTTP POSTs repeatedly to create brand new documents.  Each of these actions got run 100000 times, and here are two graphs of the results.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, as there is no baseline to compare things against just yet, the benchmark was performed using only one requester at a time, with light concurrency (10 users at once), and with more concurrency (100 users at once). Note that it’s expected with only one backend node that higher concurrency would cause degradation in performance; you should have multiple nodes to service that degree of concurrent requests!</p>

<p>Here are the results for reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s to the accidental security engineers. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p>

  <p>To every engineer who’s ever spent a day scratching their head, wondering how to comply with a new security policy.</p>

  <p>To all those lost sprints building annoying primitives that “<em>have</em> to exist somewhere already”.</p>

  <p>To all the stressful weeks of getting pulled off new features to help prepare for an audit.</p>

  <p>To every web app, Slack bot, CLI, and microservice that was hacked together to help roll out a new control, only to become a pain-in-the-ass to maintain.</p>

  <p>It was us. We’ve been the ones tasked with building this mess. Constantly trading off velocity and security. But no more. We’re going to solve this problem, together, once and for all.</p>

  <p>Enter: Sym.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hello-sym">Hello, Sym</h2>

<p>Sym is the security workflow platform made for engineers, by engineers. We solve the intent-to-execution gap between policies and workflows by providing fast-moving engineering teams with the just-right primitives to roll out best-practice controls.</p>

<p>Our hand-crafted Terraform templates let you easily provision instances of common security controls, while our Python SDK unlocks ridiculously simple customization to meet your team’s needs and integrate with existing tools. We’ve got our sights set on fixing the “Build vs Buy” problem with security workflows… the problem being that both options currently suck.</p>

<p>I’m overjoyed and humbled to share that we’re not embarking on this quest alone. We’re off to the races with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/sym-raises-9m-series-a-for-its-security-workflow-platform/">$9M Series A led by Sunil Dhaliwal at Amplify Partners</a>, following hot on the heels of a $3M Seed led by Robin Vasan at Mango Capital and Andy McLoughlin at Uncork Capital.</p>

<p>They say “never meet your heroes”, but with participation from security &amp; technology executives at GitHub, Datadog, Atlassian, Google, Bugsnag, and Segment, alongside early design partners like LaunchDarkly, we’re sure glad we met ours!</p>

<p>We’re excited to unveil our vision to the world, and announce that we’ve partnered with some of the best investors, engineers, and leaders in the industry to tackle this mountainous problem space. Every single person behind Sym has experienced our struggle first-hand (phew, we’re not crazy!), and won’t rest until we solve it. Let’s do this!</p>

<h2 id="howd-we-get-here">How’d we get here?</h2>

<p>Story time! I met Adam and Jon when I was a freshman at MIT. I distinctly remember walking into the Startup Career Fair wondering how I could circumvent the “no freshmen” rule most companies seemed to have when hiring interns. A friendly senior had let me know to watch out for the scores that recruiters would scrawl on resumes before haphazardly throwing them on the pile. A week prior, I watched a Facebook recruiter scratch a “1” onto mine, circling the sad number repeatedly before smiling and telling me to have a nice day. My world fell apart. This week was going to be different.</p>

<p>After having a great chat with this guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev">Vlad</a> (Robinhood wasn’t a Big Deal yet), I ran into Adam. He was the VP of Engineering at a Boston-based company called Localytics, and seemed as relieved as I was to be having a conversation. I hesitantly bought into his pitch, and scheduled a time to come onsite. Little did I know, that thoughtless commitment would totally change the trajectory of my life, and one day be responsible for the founding of Sym!</p>

<p>The first meeting was uneventful, or so I thought. I showed up 30 minutes late to a rather exasperated Adam lecturing me on the demerits of interview tardiness. Throughout the years, I’ve grown very accustomed to that frustrated expression 😅. Though I’m still notoriously late for most things in life, I’ve never again failed to be punctual for a job interview!</p>

<p>Against his better judgement, Adam brought me on as an early intern at Localytics. It was my first job, and he was my first boss. I learned the ropes (read: how to ignore everyone’s advice while minimally pissing them off), and got to collaborate on some <a href="https://eng.localytics.com/your-code-coverage-is-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad/">really fun projects</a>. Jon (our third cofounder) spent a lot of time reprimanding me.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the summer <del>fighting</del> working together, and ended with a particularly controversial project where, against the better judgement of basically everyone, I pumped out a heap of flaky Javascript code for saving reports, and then peaced out from the company ✌️.</p>

<p>I’m extremely grateful that over the span of a decade, I stayed in touch with these two. Our relationship evolved, from manager-intern, to mentor-mentee, to peers, to cofounders. When I stepped away from my last company to start Sym, those two were my first call. And boy, am I glad they were.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e009c90866e63034acc943efabdfa4a6457078d7/c6517/assets/hello-sym/map.png" alt="Map"></p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-sym">Evolution of Sym</h2>

<p>When Jon, Adam, and I sat down to build Sym, we wanted to solve a very simple problem: every engineering org we know in a heavily-regulated space was building the same damn tooling. Coming from healthcare and enterprise SaaS, we’d seen permutations of the same few workflows time and time again throughout our careers. A way to grant engineers temporary access to infrastructure? Check. A way to approve one-off queries? Check. Something to make quarterly risk assessments suck less? Check. Chat-Ops for approving outgoing deploys? Check.</p>

<p>The crazy thing was, these seemed to be ubiquitous across companies, compliance standards, even industries. Chatting with fellow founders about stuff I’d built to help keep my team productive would always result in one of two reactions: “<em>oh yea, we built the same thing! let’s trade notes…“</em>, or <em>“oh shit, we should have built this years ago”</em>. So we came up with a crazy idea: what if we just build all this stuff once, and put it out in the world for everyone to use. We were going to start with HIPAA-induced workflows. Sym: HIPAA in a box, for engineers. Of course, things rarely work out that simply.</p>

<p>We rapidly discovered something while talking to potential users: our hypothesis that everyone is building tools for the same workflows was a bit off. It wasn’t the case that everyone’s workflows were identical, but instead that they had the same <em>shared core</em>. It turns out, what most teams do is they start by building the same <strong>primitives</strong>, and then they layer on <strong>customizations</strong> that reflect existing processes and tools. So, we adjusted our approach to match this revelation.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dc4f6494be10e2dfb90dc745bd96e83fffad695e/7aa7d/assets/hello-sym/graph.gif" alt="Graph"></p>

<p>Today, Sym is a set of workflow templates (<strong>primitives</strong>) for engineering teams working on improving security posture, and a suite of integrations (<strong>customizations</strong>) that connect those templates to existing systems and policies. Our mission is to enable any team to effortlessly build unobtrusive security and governance workflows, so we make sure to meet developers where they are: our primitives are exposed as Infrastructure-as-Code, and our SDK captures last-mile variance in workflows. The tools we use to distribute Sym Workflows are Terraform and Python, but your organization doesn’t have to be familiar with either to use us.</p>

<p>With Sym, you can roll out many common security and governance workflows with ~30 lines of declarative config and a couple function body definitions. Our goal is for you to blow your InfoSec team away; bring speed, sophistication, and thoroughness to your controls, without losing a whole month each time. Beautiful dashboards with just-right reports will materialize, without a single tedious line of logging code.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b56882478ed2e08f51d3f70075e993d385a2eef/193db/assets/hello-sym/code.png" alt="Code"></p>

<p>We’re currently live (in production!) at a handful of public and private companies in the Healthcare and B2B SaaS spaces. Our initial workflows focus on governance and just-in-time access of cloud and app-level resources.</p>

<p>Our latest customer is locking down SSH access by rolling out <a href="https://compliance.dev/2020/03/23/aws-session-manager-ssh-tunnels-with-less-user-management/">AWS Session Manager tunnels</a> as the preferred way to connect to instances, with the IAM Role required to use SSM protected by Sym. This is one of many examples where we’re able to help infra teams adopt cutting-edge cloud offerings while increasing security posture. If this sounds like something that you’d like for your team, please <a href="https://symops.com/">reach out</a>!</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-x">But what about X?</h2>

<p>We’re in a crowded space! Luckily, we see the world with a unique lens. Sym brings an emphasis on developer experience, opinionated workflows that codify best practices, and an aspiration to be the bridge between Security and Compliance. The jury’s still out on whether we’re totally brilliant or totally out to lunch.</p>

<p>Our vision at Sym is to become the de-facto standard for implementing and showcasing security posture. Importantly, we’re not setting out to be a middleman levying a tax on the system. We saw enough of those in our healthcare days. Instead, we’re striving to improve the status quo for every stakeholder in the security equation; our place as the obvious-choice bridge between security and compliance will be an emergent property of the system we’re fighting to improve.</p>

<p>We’ve got a long way to go to make that vision a reality. In the interim, we’re tackling several problems plaguing our friends and colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="security-intent-to-implementation-gap">Security intent-to-implementation gap</h3>

<p>A security intent-to-implementation gap is endemic in our industry today. Experts are laying out guidelines, policies, and best-practices, only to be foiled by the gargantuan effort required to implement workflows that reflect these intents. And to be honest, we can’t really blame engineering teams for this. As an industry, we’ve learned not to roll our own crypto, because it’s so easy to shoot yourself in the foot, but can you imagine how many ways there are to screw up a Slack bot that issues temporary database credentials? Or how easy it is to forget to put MFA around an admin God-mode dashboard? Twitter hack, anyone?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2fa7f55e98cd8c615f0db83c6fd96236b49266a2/67dc7/assets/hello-sym/headlines.png" alt="Headlines"></p>

<p>Sensitive access workflows are the perfect example of a control that should be implemented once, and safely customized many times. This is where Sym is starting today.</p>

        <p>Football (or soccer to my American readers) is full of clichés: “It’s a game of two halves”, “taking it one game at a time” and “Liverpool have failed to win the Premier League”. You’re less likely to hear “Treating the number of goals scored by each team as independent Poisson processes, statistical modelling suggests that the home team have a 60% chance of winning today”. But this is actually a bit of cliché too (it has been discussed <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/soccer/how-to-calculate-poisson-distribution">here</a>, <a href="https://help.smarkets.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001457989-How-to-calculate-Poisson-distribution-for-football-betting">here</a>, <a href="http://pena.lt/y/2014/11/02/predicting-football-using-r/">here</a>, <a href="http://opisthokonta.net/?p=296">here</a> and <a href="https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/football/r/predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling/">particularly well here</a>). As we’ll discover, a simple Poisson model is, well, overly simplistic. But it’s a good starting point and a nice intuitive way to learn about statistical modelling. So, if you came here looking to make money, <a href="http://www.make5000poundspermonth.co.uk/">I hear this guy makes £5000 per month without leaving the house</a>.</p>

<h2 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson Distribution</h2>

<p>The model is founded on the number of goals scored/conceded by each team. Teams that have been higher scorers in the past have a greater likelihood of scoring goals in the future. We’ll import all match results from the recently concluded Premier League (2016/17) season. There’s various sources for this data out there (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">kaggle</a>, <a href="http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php">football-data.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata">github</a>, <a href="http://api.football-data.org/index">API</a>). I built an <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/footballR">R wrapper for that API</a>, but I’ll go the csv route this time around.</p>

<p>We imported a csv as a pandas dataframe, which contains various information for each of the 380 EPL games in the 2016-17 English Premier League season. We restricted the dataframe to the columns in which we’re interested (specifically, team names and numer of goals scored by each team). I’ll omit most of the code that produces the graphs in this post. But don’t worry, you can find that code on <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/blogScripts/blob/master/Jupyter/2017-06-04-predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling.ipynb">my github page</a>. Our task is to model the final round of fixtures in the season, so we must remove the last 10 rows (each gameweek consists of 10 matches).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>epl_1617</span> <span>=</span> <span>epl_1617</span><span>[:</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
<span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>HomeGoals    1.591892
AwayGoals    1.183784
dtype: float64
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll notice that, on average, the home team scores more goals than the away team. This is the so called ‘home (field) advantage’ (discussed <a href="https://jogall.github.io/2017-05-12-home-away-pref/">here</a>) and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1803416-is-home-field-advantage-as-important-in-baseball-as-other-major-sports">isn’t specific to soccer</a>. This is a convenient time to introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>. It’s a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of the number of events within a specific time period (e.g 90 mins) with a known average rate of occurrence. A key assumption is that the number of events is independent of time. In our context, this means that goals don’t become more/less likely by the number of goals already scored in the match. Instead, the number of goals is expressed purely as function an average rate of goals. If that was unclear, maybe this mathematical formulation will make clearer:</p>



<p> represents the average rate (e.g. average number of goals, average number of letters you receive, etc.). So, we can treat the number of goals scored by the home and away team as two independent Poisson distributions. The plot below shows the proportion of goals scored compared to the number of goals estimated by the corresponding Poisson distributions.</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/home_away_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can use this statistical model to estimate the probability of specfic events.</p>



<p>The probability of a draw is simply the sum of the events where the two teams score the same amount of goals.</p>



<p>Note that we consider the number of goals scored by each team to be independent events (i.e. P(A n B) = P(A) P(B)). The difference of two Poisson distribution is actually called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellam_distribution">Skellam distribution</a>. So we can calculate the probability of a draw by inputting the mean goal values into this distribution.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of draw between home and away team</span>
<span>skellam</span><span>.</span><span>pmf</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of home team winning by one goal</span>
<span>skellam</span><span>.</span><span>pmf</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/skellam_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, hopefully you can see how we can adapt this approach to model specific matches. We just need to know the average number of goals scored by each team and feed this data into a Poisson model. Let’s have a look at the distribution of goals scored by Chelsea and Sunderland (teams who finished 1st and last, respectively).</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/chelsea_sunderland_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="building-a-model">Building A Model</h2>

<p>You should now be convinced that the number of goals scored by each team can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. Due to a relatively sample size (each team plays at most 19 home/away games), the accuracy of this approximation can vary significantly (especially earlier in the season when teams have played fewer games). Similar to before, we could now calculate the probability of various events in this Chelsea Sunderland match. But rather than treat each match separately, we’ll build a more general Poisson regression model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression">what is that?</a>).</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the <code>smf.glm(...)</code> part, you can find more information <a href="http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/glm_formula.html">here</a> (edit: earlier versions of this post had erroneously employed a Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE)- <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16390/when-to-use-generalized-estimating-equations-vs-mixed-effects-models">what’s the difference?</a>). I’m more interested in the values presented in the <code>coef</code> column in the model summary table, which are analogous to the slopes in linear regression. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>, we take the <a href="http://www.lisa.stat.vt.edu/sites/default/files/Poisson.and_.Logistic.Regression.pdf">exponent of the parameter values</a>. A positive value implies more goals (), while values closer to zero represent more neutral effects (). Towards the bottom of the table you might notice that <code>home</code> has a <code>coef</code> of 0.2969. This captures the fact that home teams generally score more goals than the away team (specifically, =1.35 times more likely). But not all teams are created equal. Chelsea has a <code>coef</code> of 0.0789, while the corresponding value for Sunderland is -0.9619 (sort of saying Chelsea (Sunderland) are better (much worse!) scorers than average). Finally, the <code>opponent*</code> values …</p></section></div></div>

It is doing so via a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp II (NYSE: IPOB), which is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by investor <a href="http://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/index.html" rel="noopener">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>. Opendoor published an <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-Overview_vPDF_02.pdf" rel="noopener">investor presentation</a> as part of its merger announcement in September, and last week the company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000110465920112009/tm2030455-1_s41.htm" rel="noopener">filed its S-4</a> (similar to an S-1, but used for companies engaged in a merger process). The transaction values Opendoor at $4.8B (pre-merger value) and the company will receive north of $1B in proceeds ($600M <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe-deal.asp" rel="noopener">PIPE</a> and $414M via merger with IPOB). While the SPAC merger process is quite interesting on its own (good posts on the topic <a href="https://medium.com/@andyravreby/attack-of-the-spac-baafd47f6ecc" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/spac-attack-everything-a-founder" rel="noopener">here</a>), this post will focus in on the Opendoor business, its progress to date and its prospects for the future.</p><p id="ce64">Opendoor, founded in 2014, transforms the process of selling a home into a seamless digital experience, eliminating uncertainty for sellers. Sellers can go to Opendoor.com, receive an offer for their home, sign and close on the date of their choice — a dramatic improvement over the traditional selling process which can take 100+ days. In return, Opendoor receives a 6–12% discount on the market value of the home. This model is remarkably consistent with the vision described in Opendoor’s <a href="https://thomvest.box.com/v/opendoor_a" rel="noopener">Series A presentation</a> (worth a read). In addition to the spread captured when buying and selling homes, Opendoor earns revenue via ancillary services related to the real estate transaction, including title insurance, escrow services and home financing solutions.</p><p id="357e">In 2019, the company sold 18,799 homes across 21 markets, generating $4.7 billion in revenue (up more than 160% from the prior year). While the growth of the business has been impressive, Opendoor remains several years from profitability, having posted net losses of $339 million in 2019 and $117 million through the first half of 2020. Opendoor has ambitious plans to reach nearly 38,000 annual home sales and $10 billion in revenue by 2023. The company expects to become EBITDA-positive (on a non-GAAP basis) by the second half of 2023.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5208/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png" width="2604" height="920" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eefd">While the core vision of the company is quite elegant (“building the digital one-stop shop to move” according to Opendoor founder Eric Wu), the path to realizing that vision is incredibly complex. It requires thousands of employees across dozens of markets, holding billions in home value at any given time. So what is Opendoor’s path to becoming a large <em>and</em> profitable company? Below I’ve outlined <strong>five key</strong> <strong>“things you need to believe”</strong> as the company marches down that path, as well as some thoughts around the Opendoor’s valuation relative to other public real estate companies.</p><h2 id="a8ea">1. Opendoor’s economies of scale drive down per-unit expenses &amp; box-out competitors</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5220/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png" width="2610" height="1154" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ee83">Opendoor has built a massive home buying and selling operation that involves more than 1,000 employees across 21 markets. The company sold nearly 19,000 homes in 2019 (about 70 transactions per business day) and purchased thousands more. That scale is quite impressive given the fragmented, hyper-localized nature of real estate. This scale gives the company some important advantages:</p><ul><li id="0749">Opendoor has more borrowing capacity, a higher advance rate, and a lower cost of capital than many of its iBuyer peers; according to the company’s S-4, Opendoor has access to $2.8B in senior credit facilities with a total weighted average interest rate of 4%. It also has mezzanine facilities (loans that are subordinate to senior debt) in place to bring its effective advance rate to 100%. This allows the company to scale home purchase volume without tapping its own balance sheet.</li><li id="8800">Opendoor has developed a third-party network of more than 10,000 subcontractors, managed by a centralized operations team. This model has led to a 50% reduction in spend per home over the last 2 years. Additionally, the company has been able to negotiate bulk discounts on home materials (more than 40% lower than retail prices). According to <a href="https://www.mikedp.com/" rel="noopener">Mike DelPrete</a>, Opendoor’s average repair costs are about 2–2.5% of home value, compared to an estimated 4% at Offerpad and 5% at Zillow.</li></ul><p id="d50b"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="32f4">While economies of scale have definitely kicked in at Opendoor, there are also quite large fixed costs associated with operating the business that require <em>even greater</em> scale to overcome. For instance, in 2019 the company sold 18,799 homes and generated $301M in gross profit; however, its total operating expenses as a percentage of gross profit exceeded 180%.</p><p id="5020">Additionally, as the company continues to scale home purchase volume, incremental returns to scale may be diminished. For example, there are limitations to the bulk discounts suppliers can offer, limitations to cost of capital improvements, and some areas in which costs will always scale in proportion to volume (i.e. property taxes, utilities and insurance). And with time, its fellow iBuyers may achieve similar economies of scale. Given this dynamic, we expect the company to pursue incremental revenue streams as a means of improving its margin profile (more on this later).</p><h2 id="8003">2. Accumulating advantages makes the Opendoor business better &amp; more defensible over time</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5884/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png" width="2942" height="1140" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eced">In addition to cost advantages that come with scale, Opendoor has developed a set of <em>accumulating data advantages</em> that are more proprietary and durable in nature. This informs the price it offers prospective home sellers, as well as the renovations made on purchased homes in order to maximize ROI. From the S-4:</p><blockquote><p id="b5aa">We have conducted over 150,000 home assessments during which we collect over 100 data points on each home and its surroundings. These proprietary data points have led us to make over one billion annotations and corrections to Multiple Listing Services (“MLS”) and tax assessor data, as well as build out new, non-traditional geospatial data assets, such as power line ​proximity and road noise level. The additional home level data we collect from local vendors provides structured feedback on each home and further strengthens our data moat.</p></blockquote><p id="9893">This data asset leads to better pricing models that can assign specific values to home features (i.e. granite vs. tile countertops) as well as identify the areas in which home renovations may drive the highest return. Better pricing accuracy creates an important flywheel for the business: pricing accuracy improvements allow Opendoor to lower the fee it charges, which increases purchase volume, which in turn further contributes to its data asset and pricing accuracy. There are also accumulating advantages around brand which may improve Opendoor’s customer acquisition costs over time. It’s no surprise that despite the proliferation of iBuyers over the last several years, Opendoor remains the largest with 64% market share (as of 2019).</p><p id="eefe"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="14b6">As the chart above indicates, iBuyers in total capture about 0.7% of U.S. home sale volume (pre-COVID). In Phoenix, Opendoor has bought and sold homes for the last six years, completing thousands of transactions and refining its pricing and operational models along the way. In Q1 2020, Opendoor reached 4.1% market share in Phoenix before pausing home buying due to COVID-19.</p><p id="c9c2">While that’s certainty impressive scale in a single market, it’s also indicative of the potential limits to capturing even more share — a large subset of sellers may simply prefer to market their homes as opposed to selling to an iBuyer at a discount. The next chapter of Opendoor’s growth story may not come solely from better pricing models, but instead by building new products and services that cater to multiple customer segments.</p><h2 id="4df8">3. Opendoor will be able to increase gross profit per transaction via ancillary products and services</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5224/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png" width="2612" height="1064" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="6e55">Critical to the Opendoor strategy is its ability to attach additional products and services to its transactions. The company expects its gross profit per home to increase by about $8,000 in 2023, driven primarily by these ancillary revenue streams. In its investor presentation, Opendoor highlighted several service areas, including:</p><ul><li id="3bbb">Integrated title insurance and escrow services (via its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opendoor-acquires-title-and-escrow-company-os-national-300912033.html" rel="noopener">acquisition of OS National</a> in 2019). 80% of Opendoor home transactions that closed during 2019 included the in-house title &amp; escrow service (in the markets in which the service was available). This represents $1,750 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="f807">The company recently launched <a href="https://opendoorhomeloans.com/?abad=true" rel="noopener">Opendoor Home Loans</a>, a tech-enabled mortgage platform for customers looking to buy or refinance a home, which is licensed in eight states. This represents $5,000 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="7404">Opendoor plans to add additional services over time, such as home insurance, home warranty, moving and storage, and home repair and maintenance. It believes these services represent up to $7,500 in incremental margin per home.</li></ul><p id="695c">The roll out of multiple services allows the company to create incentives for bundling. For example, Opendoor may be willing to lower its home purchase fee (currently 6%-12%) if a customer agrees to finance their next home with Opendoor Home Loans, or purchases an Opendoor home insurance policy. Bundling may then improve seller conversion rates — according to Opendoor’s investor presentation, sellers are about twice as likely to sell their home at a 6% fee vs. a 12% fee.</p><p id="47cf">This strategy has been executed successfully by home builders for many years. For example, <a href="https://lennar.com/" rel="noopener">Lennar</a> has an in-house financing arm called Eagle Point, which is used by buyers to finance about 70% of Lennar’s home sales.</p><p id="8c30"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="f697">As the Lennar expample indicates, this strategy around attaching multiple revenue streams to a real estate transaction is not new — it’s common amongst real estate brokerages, home builders, and technology-enabled real estate companies like Zillow. While Opendoor has demonstrated that it can generate a high attach rate with title &amp; escrow, the company did not provide data around its mortgage business or buy-side services. Title &amp; escrow are typically viewed as commodity offerings and consumers are more likely …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creating a successful new business is hard in any industry, but in insurance itâ€™s an especially daunting challenge. You need a world-class team, a differentiated product, and deeply supportive and patient carrier partners. Even with all of that, you need a healthy serving of luck.</p><p>At Newfront, weâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to have all of those ingredients. And while weâ€™re still a long way off from achieving our ambitions, today is an important milestone. We've spent the last three years focusing on building a strong business, and today we're announcing that <strong>weâ€™ve raised more than $100MM to date, most recently at a $500MM valuation</strong>. Founders Fund and Meritech Capital are our lead investors. A full list of investors is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abe-4">here</a>.</p><p>While our journey is far from over, this has certainly been a time for us to pause and reflect on how far weâ€™ve come. My own story with insurance began early in my career. I was lucky to help build two highly successful companies (Invitation Homes and Opendoor) and in both cases I was tasked with handling our property and casualty insurance. While happy to take care of something as critical as mitigating existential risk, I was stunned by the archaic and confusing process. I filled out mountains of paperwork, waited for weeks, and then received back wildly different options that were nearly impossible to compare. There was no clear dataset to help me understand which carriers to approach, which coverages to seek, or how peer businesses were buying. The process repeated each year, and was even worse when dealing with claims.</p><p>As a businessperson, it shocked me that the safety net so crucial to a functioning economy, innovation, and entrepreneurship could be so broken. I dug in and found that I wasnâ€™t alone in feeling the pain. My co-founder Gordon, an MIT grad who built a startup acquired by LinkedIn, had dealt with the pain of buying insurance for his company. For too many business owners, dealing with insurance has become an unpleasant, almost unbearable process. For insurance industry professionals, doing their jobs has become tedious, with the productivity gains made in other industries passing them by, forcing longer hours for lower pay. For industry leaders, attracting high-quality talent to the industry has become an existential challenge. I became obsessed with the idea of modernizing the industry by empowering the people at its core with purpose-built technology.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon and I launched Newfront in 2017, a year in which several startups were attracting huge investments with a goal of eliminating insurance brokers. We were convinced that their approach was dead wrong. We had already spent countless hours with CFOs, GCs, risk managers, and business owners and concluded that skilled insurance brokers are a <strong><em>foundational requirement</em></strong> for high-quality risk mitigation. The problem wasnâ€™t the broker, it was the brokerage. The typical brokerage forced brokers to behave like data collection and paperwork processing machines, preventing them from deepening their skills or providing expert advice. The brokerages had abandoned their brokers. We resolved to do something about that.</p><p>But first we needed to learn what had gone wrong. Why had brokerages fallen so far behind the innovation curve? Why was the average net promoter score for brokerages sitting at a dismal 17 (with 100 being the best)? Why werenâ€™t brokers given the tools that they needed? It didnâ€™t take long to learn that many of these changes resulted from the rise of private equity within the industry. Over a dozen years, private equity funds had purchased thousands of brokerages around the United States with an exclusive focus on generating short-term gains for their investors, rather than long term value for clients. These funds, which operate on short investment windows, do not have the time or incentive to make material investments in technology, the client experience, or tools to support brokers.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Our model is different. We have the resources, commitment, and know-how to create the brokerage that is truly built for the 21st century. A brokerage where we build our own technology and software in-house, where innovation is our mantra, and where improving outcomes and experiences for our clients is an obsession. While weâ€™ve learned a great deal over the past three years (and made plenty of mistakes along the way!), our founding thesis hasnâ€™t changed -- <strong><em>that the future of our industry combines experts with technology to better serve clients</em></strong>.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Today we are a team of nearly 200, proudly serving over 5,000 clients across nearly every industry. While we are still only beginning our journey, our book already puts us in the top 100 brokerages in America. And weâ€™re just getting started.</p></div></div>]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  
  

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Find common Chinese characters using pinyin.</p>

<p>Click the image to try it now:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/cn/hanzi/"><img src="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/images/hanzi_screenshot.png" alt="Hanzi searchtool showing common Chinese characters pronounced &quot;shi&quot;"></a></p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>It’s a tool that allows you to enter pinyin and optionally a tone number and shows only the <em>commonly used</em> Chinese characters with this pronunciation.</p>

<p>It allows you to switch between the top 3500 character list (frequently used) or the top 6500 (relatively common),</p>

<p>Some other features include showing or hiding all pinyin pronunciations for the characters, and showing or searching by the index of the character from the source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a>.</p>

<p>It currently only deals with simplified characters, because that’s what the source deals with and what I’m trying to learn.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a comprehensive Chinese learning tool. To learn Chinese you need to learn words, not just characters. Characters are just one layer in the Chinese language, and even full understanding of all Chinese characters would not mean you’ve learned the language.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-made-this">Why I made this</h2>

<p>While learning Chinese, I wanted to get an understanding of which Chinese characters are actually in common use. If you look in a dictionary for a list of Chinese characters, you will get a bewildering amount of characters. Dictionaries try to be comprehensive. Fortunately, most of these are only in historic use.</p>

<p>I wanted to remove the forest of irrelevant (for my purposes) characters and find get a list of ones actually worth investing time into.</p>

<p>I made this to get an overview and easily be able to answer questions like “how many common characters share this pronunciation?”.</p>

<p>I also wanted it to work without having to wait for a web page to load for each query. I made it work using a fully offline search (you download the data when loading the page itself).</p>

<h2 id="sources-and-data">Sources and data</h2>

<p>During my search I found this official list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a> made by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Sadly, this list is a rasterized PDF which does not even contain the pronunciation of these characters.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed like a good authoritative reference of commonly used characters. I started searching around and found a text version of it on <a href="http://xh.5156edu.com/page/z6211m4474j19255.html">this Chinese webpage</a>. While checking the data I found it had some mistakes around characters 3649 to 3668, which I had to fix manually.</p>

<p>To combine this with pronunciation data I found the <a href="ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/data/Uni2Pinyin.gz">Unicode Pinyin Table</a>. I’ve added numerouos pronunciations manually, when I found them missing from that source. I’ve logged my manual edits in <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt">edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt</a>. Note that since I’m only a basic Chinese speaker myself, I can’t exclude that there’s likely more mistakes. I’m open to using a more reliable source for pronunciation data if one is available.</p>

<p>Using this data I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv</a> files which are the source of the Hanzi search tool.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-make-this">How did I make this</h2>

<p>Originally I just used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> to search the hanzi-pinyin CSV files, but found it to become cumbersome due to the need to write regular expressions when I just wanted to think about pinyin.</p>

<p>I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/cnhz.py">cnhz</a> python script for myself, originally as a simple wrapper to build the grep regexes for me so I could just write pinyin. I then added more features around it.</p>

<p>As it got more useful I thought about how I could make it more accessible for other Chinese learners too. Most of them do not use Linux or have Python installed. I thought of rewriting it in Go to make it a single executable - but found the command line format would be awkward for most people. Also Windows cmd.exe does not support Chinese characters.</p>

<p>I eventually decided to turn it into a webpage. the CSV files were sufficiently small that the entire database could be loaded into the browser’s memory so you could do a completely client side search - making the experience much smoother than loading an online dictionary entry.</p>

<p>Also, because I can easily host it on my own web page, which I pay for anyway, I don’t have any need to add advertisements or anything to make the experience worse.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the page can easily be downloaded and used offline by any learner in case my site goes down or for when you don’t have internet.</p>

<p>I tried to support offline working more by making the site into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">progressive web app</a>. However, while adding a manifest was easy, I found that to add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service worker</a> (which allows offline caching) - I would have to move all assets including a copy of my main CSS file to /cn/hanzi/. Not having time to figure this out at the moment, I decided to not add service workers for now.</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://localhost:4000/js/hanzi_list.js">hanzi_list.js</a> file was generated from the CSV sources using an <code>awk</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt; ../files/hanzi-pinyin-full.csv \
    awk \
    'NR==1 { printf "const hanzi_3500 = \"" }
     NR==3501 { printf "\"; const hanzi_6500 = hanzi_3500 + \"" }
     { print NR","$0"\\n\\" }
     END { print "\";\nconst hanzi_6500_split = hanzi_6500.split(\"\\n\");" }' \
 &gt; ../js/hanzi_list.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope you find my <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/cn/hanzi">Chinese hanzi tool</a> useful. If you have any questions or want to contact me, see my details below.</p>

October 20, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is Part 2 in our blog series on our experience building a runtime reflection system in Rust for our policy engine, oso. </p>
<p>In Part 1, we built a simple class system, with a metaclass struct called <code>Class</code> to track type information. We also introduced the <code>Instance</code> struct to wrap any object and erase the type using <code>dyn Any</code>. You can find Part 1: dyn Class <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">here</a>. </p>
<p>In this post, we'll go through how we support accessing arbitrary attributes on our instances at runtime. There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including the use of traits from the standard library and commonly used crates like <code>serde</code>. We'll talk through the pros and cons of each, and the version we landed on: adding attribute getters.</p>
<h2>Accessing attributes on a struct</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    x: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to write the following code in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">Polar</a>, the oso Policy language:</p>
<pre><code>x_is_one(foo: Foo) if
    foo.x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>and have it check that <code>foo</code> has an attribute called <code>x</code> and that its value is 1.</p>
<h3>What makes this so hard?</h3>
<p>To start with, there is no <code>getattr(foo, "x")</code> equivalent in Rust. And what makes this hard to implement ourselves is that Rust (by default) provides no guarantees about things like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation">the memory layout of a struct</a>. In fact, in some cases will simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">optimise away the field entirely</a>. Even in debug builds, a debugger might be unable to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46698">lookup the value of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you haven't <em>explicitly</em> told Rust that you want it to let you access an attribute, you're unlikely to get it.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>Let's start by thinking about the method signature for dynamic access. We would like to take in an <code>Instance</code> and an attribute name (<code>&amp;str</code>), and return a value to the policy engine.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code>Fn(&amp;Instance, &amp;str) -&gt; PolarValue;
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two distinct places we could conceivably implement this method: on <code>Instance</code>, and in <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, if we implement it directly on <code>Instance</code>, then we don't need to do any more work to look up the class in order to get attributes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to store the attributes <em>somewhere</em> so that we can add them to the instance on creation. So we would probably need to store these these on the <code>Class</code> anyway, and then copy them onto the <code>Instance</code>.</p>
<p>It's a subtle distinction, but for us it made more sense to the keep the instance lightweight, and to use the <code>Class</code> to store the attribute lookups. Although in Python its perfectly valid to add attributes to a class on the fly, we have that requirement in neither the host language nor in Polar.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we simply add a method on an <code>Instance</code> to retrieve the class of it, and we can get attributes from there:</p>
<pre><code>impl Instance {
    fn get_class(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;Class&gt; { ... }

    pub fn get_attribute(&amp;self, name: &amp;str, host: &amp;mut Host) -&gt; crate::Result&lt;Term&gt; {
        let class = self.class(host)?
        class.get_attribute(self, name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing the getter</h3>
<p>To implement the <code>get_attribute</code> method, we can either implement (a) a method that can fetch <em>all</em> attributes, or (b) a method for each attribute.</p>
<p>We opted for (b), which gives us the most flexibility to decide on a per-attribute basis how the lookup works.  <code>Class</code> stores a map from attribute names to getters:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
   ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    attributes: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, AttributeGetter&gt;
}

struct AttributeGetter(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>We've now split the attribute lookup into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the getter for the named attribute: <code>(instance, name) → (instance, attributes.get(name)) → (instance, f)</code></li>
<li>Apply the getter method: <code>(instance, f) → f(instance)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of an attribute getter is the closure <code>|foo: &amp;Foo| foo.x</code> which has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/closure.html">a unique anonymous type</a> – written <code>[closure@&lt;source code location&gt;]</code>   —  and implements the trait <code>Fn(&amp;Foo) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>To store this on the class we need to do some dynamic type mapping again. First, we have in our hands an <code>Instance</code>, not a <code>Foo</code>. We saw in the last post that <code>downcast</code> would allow us to get back to a concrete type. Furthermore we cannot store a function that returns <whatever the="" type="" of="" <code="">foo.x is&gt;. Instead, we make sure to do the conversion back to a <code>PolarValue</code> as part of looking up the attribute.</whatever></p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to create such type-erased functions, and to make it easier for users of oso, the <code>AttributeGetter</code> provides a new method which handles this for them:</p>
<pre><code>impl AttributeGetter {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, R&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        T: 'static,
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(move |receiver: &amp;Instance, host: &amp;mut Host| {
            // get back the original type of the receiver
            let receiver = reveiver.downcast().expect("type error");
            // call the function; convert the result
            f(receiver).map(|res| res.to_polar(host))
        }))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use this in the builder method:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
  pub fn add_attribute_getter&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        self.attributes.insert(name, AttributeGetter::new(f));
        self
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One nice property of the above is that it's a compile-time error to define an attribute getter for the wrong class! So despite erasing the type when constructing an <code>Instance</code> and later recovering the type dynamically, it's impossible to provide the wrong getter:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0631]: type mismatch in closure arguments
  --&gt; languages/rust/oso/examples/blog.rs:53:14
   |
53 |             .add_attribute_getter("y", |foo: &amp;Bar| foo.y)
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ----------------- found signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Bar) -&gt; _`
   |              |
   |              expected signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Foo) -&gt; _`
</code></pre>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>
<p>Okay, let's see it in action! We'll start with some test setup:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo { x: u32, }

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    // Setup the host environment
    let polar = crate::Polar::new();
    let mut host = Host::new(Arc::new(polar));

   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we're a runtime class system, we need something to manage these classes at runtime. This is our <code>Host</code> object. <code>Host</code> will be responsible for things like storing class definitions and caching instances. </p>
<p>Next, we define the <code>Foo</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>// builder for defining the Foo class
let foo_class: Class = Class::builder::&lt;Foo&gt;()
    .add_attribute_getter("x", |foo| foo.x)
    .build();
// register the Foo class on the host
host.cache_class(foo_class, "Foo".into()).unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>We added a simple builder pattern to make it easier to register attributes in bulk, and the built <code>Class</code> is cached on the <code>host</code>.</p>
<p>With the setup done, we can try out accessing attributes dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>let foo_instance: Instance = Instance::new(Foo { x: 1 });
// get the value of "x" from the instance
let get_x = foo_instance.get_attribute("x", &amp;mut host).unwrap();

// check the result is the PolarValue for 1
assert_eq!(get_x, polar_core::term!(1));
</code></pre>

<p>The test looks up the value of "x" on the instance of foo, and compares it to the expected result. Dynamic attributes in action! The returned value is now a Polar term, since in normal operation the return value would be sent to the Polar VM.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is it gives the user a lot of optionality: for cases where the attribute doesn't implement <code>ToPolar</code>, we can handle conversions right in the closure defined. And the implementation itself is super simple.</p>
<p>The main downside of the approach is that it is <em>very</em> manual. For every attribute a user wants to use, they need to add the <code>add_attribute_getter</code> line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the <code>oso</code> crate, we also provide a derive macro which can handle this. We still make getting attributes an opt-in process, but the code from above becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PolarClass)]
struct Foo { 
    #[polar(attribute)]
    x: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    ...

    // builder for defining the Foo class
    let foo_class: Class = Foo::get_polar_class();

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternate Approaches</h2>
<p>The approach we outline above suits our needs, but is leveraging virtually nothing from the Rust standard library nor the Rust ecosystem. Is there really nothing out there to address this problem?</p>
<p>We'll take you through a few of the alternatives we tried. Some of them are complementary to the approach we've taken and would be reasonable future additions, others just didn't quite seem to be what we needed.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Implement <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code></h3>
<p>In some ways, the most direct route we could take would be to use the <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html">trait</a>. This is normally used for data structures like <code>Vec,</code> which allow you to index into it with <code>vec[i]</code>, or with <code>HashMap</code>, which allows you to get a key with <code>map[&amp;key]</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of using a trait from the standard library is that users may get implementations of the trait for "free", e.g., if they are already using a <code>HashMap</code>, then they don't need to do any additional work to define attribute getters that leverage the trait.</p>
<pre><code>impl ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
    fn supports_indexing(mut self) -&gt; Self
    where T: Index&lt;&amp;str&gt;
    {
        self.set_attribute_lookup(|receiver, attr| {
            receiver.index(&amp;attr)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: what is the output type for <code>Index</code>? We need it to be any type that can be converted back into the Polar core –&nbsp;perhaps <code>Box&lt;dyn ToPolar&gt;</code> or similar. To make that happen, we would be requiring the user to implement a version of <code>Index</code> for their classes, which is unlikely to be something they will want in the rest of their code. Given this, it doesn't seem like there is much benefit to using <code>Index</code>.</p>
<h3><code>serde::Serialize</code></h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a problem that requires some form of translation, <code>serde</code> comes to mind. </p>
<p>We could require types to implement <code>serde::Serialize</code>. By writing our own custom serializer, this would give us a way to leverage the existing machinery for walking over all the fields of a struct. And the ubiquity of …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Most of the time, to get root on an Android device you will use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a>. However, there may be cases where Magisk doesn't work or isn't ideal. For example, on IoT or embedded devices that don't have a traditional Android interface.</p><p>In these instances, it might be easiest to interact with the device through adb. Though more often than not adb runs as the lower privileged shell user, and the <code>adb root</code> command doesn't let you elevate permissions. It simply returns a <code>adbd cannot run as root in production builds</code> error.</p><p>If you search around the web you will find various advice telling you to add the <code>ro.debuggable=1</code> setting to the <code>default.prop</code> file, which is supposed to tell adbd it's allowed to run as root. This may work, but if it doesn't it's probably because the version of Android you're using wasn't compiled with the <code>ALLOW_ADBD_ROOT</code> flag, and the adbd code isn't configured to check the <code>ro.debuggable</code> setting.</p><p>Fortunately not all hope is lost. If all else fails, and you have the ability to upload a new boot partition to the device, you should be able to patch the adbd binary to run as root. Regardless of how the rest of the system has been configured.</p><p>Christian Weiske has a great <a href="https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/android-root-adb.htm">post</a> that introduced me to this concept. In my case, I just had to make a few modifications since the version of adbd I had was "newer" (Nougat), and I used a different method for modifying the boot image.</p><p>I'll assume you have already found a way to get a hold of the boot image. This process is highly dependent on the chipset, so you may need to Google around a bit.</p><p>The adbd binary is located in the <code>sbin</code> directory of the boot image. The easiest method I've found for extracting and modifying the boot image is with the <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/tools.html#magiskboot">magiskboot</a> tool. You can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/">latest Magisk release</a> zip archive. <strong>Note:</strong> you may need to scroll down to find a recent Magisk release, it's not in the manager releases.</p><figure><pre><code>magiskboot unpack boot.img
magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio extract</code></pre><figcaption>Extracting the boot image and ramdisk</figcaption></figure><p>Download a copy of <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> 🐉, create a new project, and import the adbd binary you just extracted. Give it a minute or two to analyze all the code. (if you need Java, try <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html">Amazon's Corretto</a> or <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot">AdoptOpenJDK</a>)</p><p>I found it much easier to figure out what I was looking at by simultaneously reading the Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/tags/android-7.1.2_r39/adb/daemon/main.cpp">source code</a>. As Christian points out in his post, it's easiest to search for the <code>Local port disabled</code> string, or <code>0x7d0</code>, which is the shell user's id in hex. This should bring you to the part of the code where adbd switches from root to the shell user. The goal here is to "comment out" that code, so the program never stops running as root.</p><p>Below is the source code we are trying to target in Ghidra.</p><figure><pre><code>// Don't run as root if running in secure mode.
if (should_drop_privileges()) {
    drop_capabilities_bounding_set_if_needed();
    minijail_change_gid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    minijail_change_uid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    // minijail_enter() will abort if any priv-dropping step fails.
    minijail_enter(jail.get());
    D("Local port disabled");
}</code></pre><figcaption>Android source code</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 940w"><figcaption>Disassembled / decompiled code (function names renamed to improve readability)</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, we want to remove the calls to <code>minijail_change_gid</code> and <code>minijail_change_uid</code>. This can be done by replacing the bytes with a series of NOP / no operation commands (<code>00 BF</code>).</p><p>Hydra doesn't do a great job at directly modifying ARM binaries, but a generic hex editor should do the trick. I used <a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>.</p><p>To remove the call to <code>minijail_change_gid</code>, find and replace the following series of bytes:</p><pre><code>4f f4 fa 61 2d f0 3e f9 &lt;- target
00 BF 00 BF 00 BF 00 BF &lt;- replaced with NOPs</code></pre><p>Do the same for <code>minijail_change_uid</code>, and save the patched binary.</p><p>You can use magiskboot to patch your ramdisk, and package up a new boot image. The repack command should create a <code>new-boot.img</code> file, that you can upload back to your Android device.</p><pre><code>magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio "add 750 sbin/adbd patched_adbd"
magiskboot repack boot.img</code></pre><p>Assuming all went well, adbd should be running as root!</p><p>Happy hacking 😊</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>In this post I want to discuss an issue that I, being for a longer time in IT meanwhile, observe over and over again. It is the observation that as an industry we continuously forget what we have learned.</p>
<p>What do I mean with that claim?</p>
<h2 id="the-very-first-discussion----again-and-again-and-">The very first discussion – again and again and …</h2>
<p>Probably I best illustrate this by sharing an experience I had. About two years ago I attended an unconference. It was not the first time I attended it. I liked it a lot. It always had a very energetic atmosphere. The participants were very active, loved to share and discuss. But unlike the previous times, I decided to do something different that year.</p>
<p>As an experiment, I decided not to share myself, not to offer sessions myself where I drive the topic of discussion, but to listen only. I know that this is not the idea of an unconference, but I was curious. As I wrote: It was a little experiment, I wanted to conduct.</p>
<p>I knew that always a very active group of people gathered at this unconference and I wanted to use that as an unbiased opportunity to learn about the state of IT, how people think about topics, what moves them, and so on. So, I looked forward to what I would learn.</p>
<p>To be frank, it was a devastating experience for me.</p>
<p>The session that really killed it was a session about <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/">reusability</a>. A group of people came together to discuss reusability. I was really curious as I dealt with the topic for many years already. A great community. A topic I am particularly interested in. I was looking forward to learning something new. I did not expect a lot of new ideas, but maybe one or two.</p>
<p>So, I listened … and could not believe what I heard.</p>
<p>The discussion moved at a level as if nobody ever had said or written a single word about reusability in the past 50 years. I felt set back to a pre-1968 discussion, set back to a time before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Software_Engineering_Conferences">NATO Software Engineering Conferences</a> were held. Where had all the ideas about reusability from the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s and all the years after gone?</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody in the room ever had heard anything about what we as an industry already had figured out about reusability. They discussed the topic completely from scratch, and due to that in a totally naive way, not touching any of the important learning of the last 50 years. I sat there listening and did not understand what happened. I felt the urge to jump up and scream: “Shut up, all of you! You do not know sh*t about reusability!”</p>
<p>Of course, I did not. Besides the fact that it would have been very rude, it also would have been unfair.</p>
<p>As I wrote before: It was a very active community that gathered there, all of them adding with their best intentions to a vibrant discussion. So, I eventually decided to leave. Not all sessions felt as devastating as this one but I had similar experiences in most of the sessions I attended.</p>
<p>I was quite confused and had a lot to ponder. I went to the conference to learn something new and … well, I learned something new. But it was definitely not what I expected to learn. I learned that the people in the sessions I attended did not seem to have any knowledge about the discussions that we had before in our industry about the very topics.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-collective-amnesia">Continuous collective amnesia</h2>
<p>What happened? It kept me a while thinking. Eventually, I realized that I had observed a disease of our whole industry in its purest form: We continuously forget what we have learned. We always reinvent everything from scratch. My personal observation is that discussions in the IT community start over about every 5 years <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That is how long we remember as a community. After that we need to rediscover your insights from scratch.</p>
<p>Or how I like to phrase it in a bit provocative way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In IT, we suffer from continuous collective amnesia and we are even proud of it! <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is not about the people who discussed in that room. All of them did their best, they eagerly discussed hoping to gather new insights. They were simply victims of a widespread disease in IT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not value the wisdom of the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We suffer from extreme youth obsession, not only regarding the age of people but also regarding how we value knowledge. Old knowledge is considered “worthless”, while new knowledge is considered “great”.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/BitmenStudios/status/1263070511812227072">tweet</a> that Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios sent me in a little conversion we had via Twitter IMO really nicely describes the effect:</p>
<p><img src="https://ufried.com/blog/continuous_amnesia_issue/continuous_amnesia.png" alt="Tweet from Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios: My point here is rather not searching for a unique “best” solution but everywhere software devs across the globe are solving the “same” problem again and again (and fall into the same pitfalls). The increase in tech needed and the associated complexity amplifies that problem." title="We solve the same problems again and again"></p>
<p>We reinvent the wheel over and over again, making the same mistakes again and again, not learning as a community. And as Mark correctly pointed out, the growing technology complexity amplifies the problem – and, as I would like to add, vice versa: Our continuous collective amnesia amplifies our <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/">growing complexity problem</a>.</p>
<p>Why is it this way? Why do we loose our collective memory every 5 years?</p>
<p>I am not sure about the causes. My current attempt of an explanation consists of 5 factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>We consider ourselves a dynamic, fast moving industry. New concepts, tools and technologies emerge every day. How can knowledge of yesterday still be applicable to problems of today? That is what we keep telling ourselves. We wallow in our perceived vigor and speed of innovation, neglecting that we keep solving the same problems over and over again, just with different tools and technologies. Yes, some things change, but usually 80%+ of the problems stay the same. But we refuse to see that. We prefer considering ourselves the “masters of new”.</li>
<li>We are technology believers. We are convinced that we can solve any problem by simply applying the right tool or technology. E.g., if people have a collaboration problem, the typical reflex is to look for a tool that solves the problem, neglecting that it almost certainly is not a tool problem. The same is true for all other kinds of problems. Whenever we face a non-trivial problem, we try to solve it by applying a tool or technology to it instead of solving the actual problem. This has become such a natural pattern that we do not realize it anymore. And as past tools and technologies did not solve the problem, we look for new ones.</li>
<li>Insights grow slower than knowledge. Our knowledge continuously grows, the longer we work in IT. Of course, not everything we learn is valuable. Quite often we learn that some of our knowledge is plain crap. If I, e.g., think back to SOA: Wow, what a crap! Would never do it again this way! But not everything was bad. I also took some great insights from the SOA times. It takes times to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the beginning of our careers we basically learn new stuff all the time. It takes some years until we start to see the recurring patterns, to separate real insights from plain knowledge.</li>
<li>We face a continuous stream of new developers. I feel as if I face a new generation of developers every 5 years <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Maybe that is a very subjective experience. But for me, people just coming from their IT education, being 5 years in business, 10 years or 15 years and more feel very different, like different generations. All those new people in IT have to build their own insights from scratch. They have nothing to build on as in IT we created a cult(ure) of new, celebrating the new and despising the old.</li>
<li>If you combine the “cult of new” with what I call “the arrogance of the youth”, you get an explosive mixture. Before you think that I want to talk bad about younger people: I just talk from personal experience. I was a graduate myself years ago and believe me: I was arrogant! I knew better! I had to learn humbleness the hard way, and I am still not sure if I arrived (it is a lot easier to judge an old self than to judge the current self). So, I do not want to reproach any young person for being somewhat arrogant. I guess that is natural and also healthy to a certain degree because it helps against persisting in outdated ideas as an industry. But in a culture of new, this habit works as an unhealthy accelerant.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put these factors together, we end up with an environment where we only value new things and despise old things. If we face a problem, we never look if someone solved the same problem before <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. We only look for a shiny new solution, ideally a new tool or technology. If we learn a good solution for a problem, we forget it after a few years and start again from scratch.</p>
<p>It is not that individuals do not learn and do not grow insights. They do.</p>
<p>But as a community, we do not.</p>
<p>Unlike other engineering disciplines, we do not create our body of knowledge, foster our timeless insights, work to extract the essence from the solutions we found yesterday and make it available to the community of today. We do not only not create a body of knowledge, we despise it. We always look to the horizon hoping to spot a silver bullet (which does not exist as we know) instead of looking back once in a while and trying to learn from the wisdom of our ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>This is what I observe all the time. Again, this does not mean that I do not meet individuals who act differently. But in general, I see the same discussions recurring again and again about every 5 years.</p>
<p>To be honest, I do not have an actual idea how to change this. This cult of new is so deeply embedded in our culture and self-perception that it would take a long time and effort to change it.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to share some of the old wisdom, e.g., with my talk <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ufried/excavating-the-knowledge-of-our-ancestors">“Excavating the knowledge of the ancestors”</a>. There is also the <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">“Papers We Love”</a> movement that tries to share such knowledge.</p>
<p>But overall this is just a drop in the ocean. It would require a radical rethinking to stop our continuous collective amnesia. We would need to accept that most of our problems are not new, but that most of the times we solve the same problems again and again, just with different technology.</p>
<p>But until we learn this, I am afraid we are not yet an engineering discipline, but rather a bunch of people obsessed with “new”, not learning.</p>

<p>In this book we will work through the motivation and technical details behind <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">differential dataflow</a>, a computational framework build on top of <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow">timely dataflow</a> intended for efficiently performing computations on large amounts of data and <em>maintaining</em> the computations as the data change.</p>
<p>Differential dataflow programs look like many standard "big data" computations, borrowing idioms from frameworks like MapReduce and SQL. However, once you write and run your program, you can <em>change</em> the data inputs to the computation, and differential dataflow will promptly show you the corresponding changes in its output. Promptly meaning in as little as milliseconds.</p>
<p>This relatively simple set-up, write programs and then change inputs, leads to a surprising breadth of exciting and new classes of scalable computation. We will explore it in this document!</p>
<hr>
<p>Differential dataflow arose from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naiad_sosp2013.pdf">work at Microsoft Research</a>, where we aimed to build a high-level framework that could both compute and incrementally maintain non-trivial algorithms.</p>

<p>Any database schema is likely to have plenty of text fields. In this article, I divide text fields into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Small texts</strong>: names, slugs, usernames, emails, etc. These are text fields that usually have some low size limit, maybe even using <code>varchar(n)</code> and not <code>text</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large texts</strong>: blog post content, articles, HTML content etc. These are large pieces of free, unrestricted text that is stored in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium texts</strong>: descriptions, comments, product reviews, stack traces etc. These are any text field that is between the small and the large. These type of texts would normally be unrestricted, but naturally smaller than the large texts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In this article I demonstrate the surprising impact of medium-size texts on query performance in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-toast"><a href="#understanding-toast">Understanding TOAST</a></h2>
<p>When talking about large chunks of text, or any other field that may contain large amounts of data, we first need to understand how the database handles the data. Intuitively, you might think that the database is storing large pieces of data inline like it does smaller pieces of data, but in fact, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html" rel="noopener">it does not</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL uses a fixed page size (commonly 8 kB), and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages. Therefore, it is not possible to store very large field values directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the documentation explains, PostgreSQL can't store rows (tuples) in multiple pages. So how does the database store large chunks of data?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] large field values are compressed and/or broken up into multiple physical rows. [...] The technique is affectionately known as TOAST (or “the best thing since sliced bread”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so how is this TOAST working exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any of the columns of a table are TOAST-able, the table will have an associated TOAST table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So TOAST is a separate table associated with our table. It is used to store large pieces of data of TOAST-able columns (the <code>text</code> datatype for example, is TOAST-able).</p>
<p>What constitutes a large value?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TOAST management code is triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than TOAST_TUPLE_THRESHOLD bytes (normally 2 kB). The TOAST code will compress and/or move field values out-of-line until the row value is shorter than TOAST_TUPLE_TARGET bytes (also normally 2 kB, adjustable) or no more gains can be had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL will try to compress a the large values in the row, and if the row can't fit within the limit, the values will be stored out-of-line in the TOAST table.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-toast"><a href="#finding-the-toast">Finding the TOAST</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <em>some</em> understanding of what TOAST is, let's see it in action. First, create a table with a text field:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table contains an id column, and a value field of type <code>TEXT</code>. Notice that we did not change any of the default storage parameters.</p>
<p>The text field we added supports TOAST, or is TOAST-able, so PostgreSQL should create a TOAST table. Let's try to locate the TOAST table associated with the table <code>toast_test</code> in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-class.html" rel="noopener"><code>pg_class</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span><span>,</span> <span>reltoastrelid</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'toast_test'</span><span>;</span>
<span>  relname   │ reltoastrelid</span>
<span>────────────┼───────────────</span>
<span> toast_test │        340488</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>oid</span> <span>=</span> <span>340488</span><span>;</span>
<span>     relname</span>
<span>─────────────────</span>
<span> pg_toast_340484</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As promised, PostgreSQL created a TOAST table called <code>pg_toast_340484</code>.</p>
<h3 id="toast-in-action"><a href="#toast-in-action">TOAST in Action</a></h3>
<p>Let's see what the TOAST table looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\d</span> <span>pg_toast.pg_toast_340484</span>
<span>TOAST table "pg_toast.pg_toast_340484"</span>
<span>   Column   │  Type</span>
<span>────────────┼─────────</span>
<span> chunk_id   │ oid</span>
<span> chunk_seq  │ integer</span>
<span> chunk_data │ bytea</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The TOAST table contains three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk_id</code>: A reference to a toasted value.</li>
<li><code>chunk_seq</code>: A sequence within the chunk.</li>
<li><code>chunk_data</code>: The actual chunk data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to "regular" tables, the TOAST table also has the same restrictions on inline values. To overcome this restriction, large values are split into chunks that can fit within the limit.</p>
<p>At this point the table is empty:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes sense because we did not insert any data yet. So next, insert a small value into the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'small value'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After inserting the small value into the table, the TOAST table remained empty. This means the small value was small enough to be stored inline, and there was no need to move it out-of-line to the TOAST table.</p>

<figcaption>Small text stored inline</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let's insert a large value and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'n0cfPGZOCwzbHSMRaX8 ... WVIlRkylYishNyXf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I shortened the value for brevity, but that's a random string with 4096 characters. Let's see what the TOAST table stores now:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>

<p>The large value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table. Because the value was too large to fit inline in a single row, PostgreSQL split it into three chunks. The <code>\x3063...</code> notation is how psql displays binary data.</p>

<p>Finally, execute the following query to summarize the data in the TOAST table:</p>

<p>As we've already seen, the text is stored in three chunks.</p>
<div>
<p>size of database objects</p>
<p>There are several ways to get the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE" rel="noopener">size of database objects in PostgreSQL</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pg_table_size</code>: Get the size of the table including TOAST, but excluding indexes</li>
<li><code>pg_relation_size</code>: Get the size of just the table</li>
<li><code>pg_total_relation_size</code>: Get the size of the table, including indexes and TOAST</li>
</ul>
<p>Another useful function is <code>pg_size_pretty</code>: used to display sizes in a friendly format.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toast-compression"><a href="#toast-compression">TOAST Compression</a></h3>
<p>So far I refrained from categorizing texts by their size. The reason for that is that the size of the text itself does not matter, what matters is its size after compression.</p>
<p>To create long strings for testing, we'll implement a function to generate random strings at a given length:</p>

<p>We can also provide a set of characters to generate the random string from. For example, generate a string made of 10 random digits:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'1234567890'</span><span>);</span>

</pre></div>


<p>PostgreSQL TOAST uses the <a href="https://doxygen.postgresql.org/pg__lzcompress_8c_source.html" rel="noopener">LZ family of compression</a> techniques. Compression algorithms usually work by identifying and eliminating repetition in the value. A long string containing fewer characters should compress very well compared to a string made of many different characters when encoded into bytes.</p>
<p>To illustrate how TOAST uses compression, we'll clean out the <code>toast_test</code> table, and insert a random string made of many possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>TRUNCATE</span> <span>toast_test</span><span>;</span>
<span>TRUNCATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10kb value made of random characters. Let's check the TOAST table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table, and we can see it is not compressed.</p>
<p>Next, insert a value with a similar length, but made out of fewer possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'123'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10K value, but this time it only contained 3 possible digits: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. This text is more likely to contain repeating binary patterns, and should compress better than the previous value. Looking at the TOAST, we can see PostgreSQL compressed the value to ~3kB, which is a third of the size of the uncompressed value. Not a bad compression rate!</p>
<p>Finally, insert a 10K long string made of a single digit:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'0'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>

<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The string was compressed so well, that the database was able to store it in-line.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Binary lambda calculus</b> (<b>BLC</b>) is a minimal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional" title="Purely functional">pure</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language" title="Functional programming language">functional programming language</a> invented by John Tromp in 2004,<sup id="cite_ref-RAC_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-RAC-1">[1]</a></sup> based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_encoding" title="Binary encoding">binary encoding</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untyped_lambda_calculus" title="Untyped lambda calculus">untyped lambda calculus</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index" title="De Bruijn index">De Bruijn index</a> notation.</p>



<h2><span id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>BLC is designed to provide a very simple and elegant concrete definition of descriptional complexity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" title="Kolmogorov complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a>).</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the complexity of an object is the length of its shortest description.</p>
<p>To make this precise, we take descriptions to be bitstrings, and identify a description method with some computational device, or machine, that transforms descriptions into objects. Objects are usually also just bitstrings, but can have additional structure as well, e.g., pairs of strings.</p>
<p>Originally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="Turing machine">Turing machines</a>, the most well known formalism for computation, were used for this purpose. But they are somewhat lacking in ease of construction and composability. Another classical computational formalism, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" title="Lambda calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, offers distinct advantages in ease of use. The lambda calculus doesn't incorporate any notion of I/O though, so one needs to be designed.</p>
<h2><span id="Binary_I.2FO">Binary I/O</span></h2>
<p>Adding a readbit primitive function to lambda calculus, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin" title="Chaitin">Chaitin</a> did for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP" title="LISP">LISP</a>, would destroy its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)" title="Referential transparency (computer science)">referential transparency</a>, unless one distinguishes between an I/O action and its result, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" title="Haskell (programming language)">Haskell</a> does with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)" title="Monad (functional programming)">monadic</a> I/O. But that requires a type system, an unnecessary complication.</p>
<p>Instead, BLC requires translating bitstrings into lambda terms, to which the machine (itself a lambda term) can be readily applied.</p>
<p>Bits 0 and 1 are translated into the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Logic_and_predicates" title="Lambda calculus">lambda booleans</a> <i>B</i><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= True and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;= False:</p>

<p>which can be seen to directly implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-then-else" title="If-then-else">if-then-else</a> operator.</p>
<p>Now consider the pairing function</p>

<p>Applying this to a boolean yields the desired component of choice.</p>

</dl>
<p>The <i>z</i> works as a list continuation, that could be a nil list (to end the string) or another string (that would be appended to the original string).</p>
<h2><span id="Delimited_versus_undelimited">Delimited versus undelimited</span></h2>
<p>Descriptional complexity actually comes in two distinct flavors, depending on whether the input is considered to be delimited.</p>
<p>Knowing the end of your input makes it easier to describe objects. For instance, you can just copy the whole input to output. This flavor is called <i>plain</i> or <i>simple</i> complexity.</p>
<p>But in a sense it is additional information. A file system for instance needs to separately store the length of files. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C language</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character" title="Null character">null character</a> to denote the end of a string, but this comes at the cost of not having that character available within strings.</p>
<p>The other flavor is called <i>prefix</i> complexity, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code" title="Prefix code">prefix codes</a>, where the machine needs to figure out, from the input read so far, whether it needs to read more bits. We say that the input is self-delimiting. This works better for communication channels, since one can send multiple descriptions, one after the other, and still tell them apart.</p>
<p>In the I/O model of BLC, the flavor is dictated by the choice of <i>z</i>. If we keep it as a free variable, and demand that it appears as part of the output, then the machine must be working in a self-delimiting manner. If on the other hand we use a lambda term specifically designed to be easy to distinguish from any pairing, then the input becomes delimited. BLC chooses <i>False</i> for this purpose but gives it the more descriptive alternative name of <i>Nil</i>. Dealing with lists that may be Nil is straightforward: since</p>

<p>We can find a description method <i>U</i> such that for any other description method <i>D</i>, there is a constant <i>c</i> (depending only on <i>D</i>) such that no object takes more than <i>c</i> extra bits to describe with method <i>U</i> than with method <i>D</i>. And BLC is designed to make these constants relatively small. In fact the constant will be the length of a binary encoding of a <i>D</i>-interpreter written in BLC, and <i>U</i> will be a lambda term that parses this encoding and runs this decoded interpreter on the rest of the input. <i>U</i> won't even have to know whether the description is delimited or not; it works the same either way.</p>
<p>Having already solved the problem of translating bitstrings into lambda calculus, we now face the opposite problem: how to encode lambda terms into bitstrings?</p>
<h2><span id="Lambda_encoding">Lambda encoding</span></h2>
<p>First we need to write our lambda terms in a particular notation using what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_indices" title="De Bruijn indices">De Bruijn indices</a>. Our encoding is then defined recursively as follows</p>

<p>A <b>closed</b> lambda term is one in which all variables are bound, i.e. without any free variables. In De Bruijn format, this means that an index <i>i</i> can only appear within at least <i>i</i> nested lambdas.

<p>In March, as Covid-19 began sending office workers home across the globe, Facebook realized it had a serious problem. The company relies on a vast army of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-international-content-moderators/">content moderators</a><strong> </strong>— often low-paid contractors — who are responsible for removing everything from nudity to hate speech and terrorism content. Their work is often sensitive and, therefore, can’t be done outside a formal office. As the world went into lockdown, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-18-2020-Press-Call-Transcript.pdf">said</a> during a press call that the social network would lean more on full-time staffers and artificial intelligence to police its platforms.</p>



<p>But, he noted, some of this work would “still be done by teams in person.” One of those teams is located thousands of miles away from the company’s California headquarters in Hyderabad, India, where, as of last year, <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-facebook-contractor-genpact-doubles-minimum-salaries-for-content-moderators-in-india-report/">1,600 Facebook moderators</a> were employed by a third-party contractor called Genpact. This summer, even as Covid-19 cases were surging in India, Genpact moderators said they felt pressured by their employer to come back to the office. While most of Facebook’s full-time employees remain safe at home, these workers have been forced to choose between their health and their livelihoods: stemming the tide of the most unsavory and disturbing posts on the internet.</p>



<p><em>Rest of World </em>spoke with four current and former Genpact employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the company. They said moderators were asked — in some cases as early as July — to return to the office to tackle sensitive content, including posts involving child exploitation, suicide, and other matter that could lead to real-world harm. Two moderators said that Genpact pressured workers to show up at Facebook’s office in HITEC City, a corporate district home to some of India’s biggest tech companies. Two moderators also reported that Genpact is continuing to shift more employees to work on Facebook content.</p>



<p>In a statement, Genpact said it couldn’t comment on specific relationships with clients, but it asserted that moderators are being asked to come into the office on only a volunteer basis. “To make this manageable, safe, and clear, employees need to sign a weekly form that asks them to voluntarily agree to this,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook also asserted that moderators are working in person only if they choose the option and that most are still doing their jobs from home. “Our focus for reopening any office is on how it can be done in a way that keeps our reviewers safe,” a spokesperson for Facebook said in a statement. “To do this we are putting strict health and safety measures in place, making sure they’re followed, and addressing and disclosing any confirmed cases of illness.”</p>



<p>With few opportunities for other work, the moderators who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> said they still felt like they had no choice but to show up in person. A senior moderator said that Genpact employees were also informed they could lose their jobs if they didn’t come to the office. “The operations team told them these are important orders,” said the moderator. “There’s a threatening factor behind [it].”</p>



<p>“People are forced to go to work, even if they are not happy to,” they added. Genpact denied that it incentivizes anyone to work in person. The company emphasized that coming into the office “is voluntary, and we remind each employee that their decision has no impact on benefits, pay, or status.” </p>



<p>In the middle of a pandemic and subsequent recession, it’s not clear where the Genpact moderators would go if they lost their jobs. “During Covid times, many companies are holding off on new recruitments,” said R. Chandra Sekharam, a commissioner with the Labour Department of Telangana, the Indian state where Hyderabad is located.</p>



<p>In March, an IT company that shares an office building with Facebook made a grim announcement: one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. Fears of contracting Covid-19 soon swept the city. Hostel owners and other landlords in Hyderabad, afraid that tenants working in large offices would bring the virus home with them, began evicting people who work in business process outsourcing (BPO) and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to two Genpact moderators, that included some of their colleagues working for Facebook. When they reached out to Genpact asking for help finding a new place to live, one employee said the plea fell on deaf ears. “There’s no help being given by the company,” they told <em>Rest of World</em>. Genpact denied the claim and said it worked with authorities to stop evictions and offered some people alternative housing.</p>





<p>Just two days after that first case of Covid-19 was announced, Genpact employees were asked to return to work in Facebook’s office, according to one moderator who was called back. In May, the<em> </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/18/facebook-google-work-from-home/"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em> </em>reported that Facebook had offered extra pay to moderators in the U.S. who voluntarily agreed to return to work. The Genpact workers told <em>Rest of World</em> that no such bonus was extended to them in India.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, the moderators said that their salaries, which amount to less than $2 an hour, were supplemented by food benefits, received either in the form of in-office meals or through a prepaid meal card. One moderator described the perk as coming directly from Facebook. But when Genpact employees were sent home during India’s Covid-19 lockdown, the benefit disappeared. During an internal Facebook meeting leaked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"><em>The Verge</em></a><em> </em>in September, Zuckerberg fielded a question from a staffer at the company’s California headquarters, who complained about the lack of free snacks available while they worked from home. But for reviewers in India, meal benefits were more than just a cushy perk: They were a crucial supplement to their low incomes. (Genpact says that it is continuing to provide packed meals and snacks for on-site workers.)</p>

<p>Moderators who have returned to Facebook’s office in Hyderabad say they are unhappy but also afraid of losing their jobs. “Calling people in [to work] in such situations is completely unprofessional,” one former moderator told <em>Rest of World</em>. That person left Genpact after being sent home in March but remains in contact with former coworkers. “Genpact is doing it because there aren’t any jobs, and people are getting laid off. So people are too scared to actually say anything. And I think that’s what Genpact is taking advantage of.”</p>



<p>Contractors, unlike Facebook’s full-time employees, have almost no leverage to demand changes to their working conditions, says Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Despite accounting for a core part of Facebook’s business, contract moderators “are viewed as replaceable cogs in a machine,” he says.</p>



<p>Facebook has also been criticized for its treatment of domestic content moderators. In May, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/854998616/in-settlement-facebook-to-pay-52-million-to-content-moderators-with-ptsd">$52 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit filed by reviewers in the U.S., who alleged the traumatic nature of their work led to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Facebook admitted no wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, the company vowed to improve labor conditions. Yet contractors have continued to report problems, particularly during the pandemic. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported that Facebook moderators at the third-party firm Accenture said they were ordered to report to their offices in Austin, Texas, without any explanation or extra pay. (Facebook said the work done by the Austin team can’t be done from home.)</p>



<p>Mithun Roy, a managing consultant at the outsourcing firm Avaya, says that companies like Genpact can charge more for employees who work directly from a client’s office than from an outsourcing site. When clients like Facebook request a firm’s services, Roy says they have to be as detailed as possible, including disclosing where the work will be performed. According to Roy, a yearlong contract from a client like Facebook can be worth millions of dollars.</p>



<p>“Management doesn’t want to miss this opportunity,” the senior Genpact moderator told<em> Rest of World</em>. That person said the company has been pushing moderators to work on-site at Facebook’s Hyderabad office even as Covid-19 cases have skyrocketed in the city, in order to gain an advantage over competitors less comfortable sending workers in person. “Even after the pandemic ends, this could [mean] new workstreams for us,” the senior moderator said.</p>



<p>Genpact and Facebook aren’t the only entities pushing contractors in Hyderabad to return to normal. The city’s economy is increasingly reliant on business from multinational tech companies. It’s been home to Microsoft’s regional headquarters since 1998, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/amazon-hyderabad-india.html">the largest Amazon office</a> in the world opened there last year. As the pandemic progressed, and many workers left the city for their hometowns, officials began fearing that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/lay-offs-loom-over-it-sector-in-hyderabad-telangana-govt-urges-centre-to-act-11588317514170.html">Hyderabad’s tech industry would soon experience massive layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Hyderabad went into lockdown on March 22. Officials began allowing <a href="https://qz.com/india/1834746/some-tcs-infosys-wipro-staff-go-to-work-amid-coronavirus/">IT workers to return to the office less than two months later on May 1</a>, and some even sooner. During India’s lockdown and subsequent reopening, IT companies were considered “essential” by the government, allowing them to skirt certain coronavirus regulations placed on other businesses. According to a state minister in Hyderabad, this designation predates the pandemic: It’s meant as a guarantee to multinational companies that their outsourced workforces won’t be disrupted.</p>



<p>Activists and health care workers <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/COVID-19-Telangana-Govt-Grossly-Under-Reporting-Cases-Activists">have warned</a> that the state of Telangana “vastly” underreported cases of Covid-19 and deaths related to the virus.

Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself. They also help you put your goals into a concrete format. Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write.

 <p>In the past (and occasionally in the present in some companies), we used to do lots of manual grunt work setting up our infrastructure. A typical approach to launching an infrastructure involved raising tickets to your data center provider and waiting for them to execute your request. A system administrator grabs the ticket and generally uses a management portal of some sort, and starts clicking away at different configuration menus until your infrastructure is deployed and provisioned.</p>

<p>This approach has worked fine for many data centers that didn’t frequently change for a long time. These companies would have virtual machines that stayed up for months or even years that didn’t scale as often.</p>

<p>Since then, infrastructure has transitioned into the cloud with companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, and many others, giving us a complete infrastructure as a service platform. Instead of having someone else provision the infrastructure for us, we have all the necessary tools required to deploy our infrastructure in the cloud. Despite having the tools provided by these companies, we still have to rely on manual infrastructure provisioning, which creates room for mistakes and more things to forget.</p>

It allows you to define your data center’s desired state and overall topology in a definition file, then uses your definition files to feed into software to provision and deploy your infrastructure, giving you very consistent and predictable environments. The benefits of infrastructure as code are many, and there is very little reason not to use it. Here are just a few of the ways Iac can help you.</span></p>

<p>Since everything is in a definition file for each infrastructure piece, Iac gives you a repeatable process with reusable components. Repeatable in the sense that you can now deploy that exact infrastructure on different platforms and environments. Reusability gives you the ability to deploy and reuse the same definition files across multiple project infrastructures. For example, if you have a web server with a specific configuration, you can use that configuration combined with other infrastructure pieces to make your task much more straightforward.</p>

<p>Finally, Since your infrastructure is code, you can commit the changes to source control software like Git, giving you the ability to track and version the change history and the evolution of your infrastructure over time. Source control also allows multiple team members to work together on the same infrastructure in a distributed way, and it keeps track of who changed what to the infrastructure.</p>

<p>Now that we understand what Iac is and why it’s important let’s talk about the two types of Iac configurations. As we’ve mentioned before, Iac uses configuration languages like YAML, JSON, HCL, and others. There are two main types of Iac configuration styles. Declarative and Imperative.</p>

<p>Imperative style is a way of writing configurations for an Iac software using a detailed and procedural set of instructions to provision your infrastructure. It needs to know the steps and the order in which it should create the infrastructure. That’s probably a bit hard to understand, so let me explain it with a pizza example.</p>

<p>Software that uses declarative configuration comes preconfigured to perform routine tasks. All you have to do is declare your desired state, and the software will take care of the rest. You don’t have to give it step by step instructions on what it should do since the software already understands how to perform your task and in which order.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terraform is an open-source declarative style infrastructure as code software created by HashiCorp. It uses a declarative style syntax known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform uses a push-based model to make changes to your infrastructure, which means that Terraform does not require you to install an agent software running on the infrastructure to use it. All you need is the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform CLI tool installed</a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on your machine, with the credentials or token of your cloud provider, and you’re good to go. Terraform is not limited to cloud providers only and can also provision on-premises infrastructures like OpenStack and VMware. It can work with Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda functions. Finally, Terraform works equally well with Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms like DataDog, CDNs such as Fastly, and even Github.</span></p>

<p>Terraform is idempotent, meaning when you run a command using Terraform to deploy a piece of infrastructure, it remembers the state. If you try to run the same configuration, it will not make any changes keeping everything in-tact and preventing accidental modifications of your infrastructure. If we reuse our pizza example, suppose you asked for Terraform to make you a pizza, and it does, then you ask it again, it will tell you, “I already gave you a pizza” unless you specify you want a new pizza Terraform won’t make it.</p>

You can install these providers in the form of plugins that Terraform can use to interact with your infrastructure provider. Plugins make Terraform highly extensible, allowing it to work with any provider.</span></p>

<p>Finally, once Terraform has provisioned your resources, it creates a state file that contains your current infrastructure’s state. Terraform can then keep track of the changes that happen over time. For example, if you have updates to your infrastructure Terraform will compare those changes and apply only the essential differences between your new changes and your current infrastructure state.</p>

<p>Terraform has two fundamental pieces that make it work, the core and providers. The core is the part of Terraform that understands your configuration and manages your infrastructure’s state definition files. It handles all lifecycle related management, such as planning creating, updating, as well as destroying your infrastructure. The second part is the providers. Providers are how Terraform connects to the outside world, such as AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and Azure.</p>

<p>One of the most underappreciated features introduced since Go version 1.8 is the Go plugin package. Plugins are one of the many software architectural designs that allow you to build loosely coupled and modular programs. In Go, plugins are written and compiled separately as shared objects (.so) or libraries and can be loaded dynamically during runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incorporating extensibility into your programs is always considered a good practice, and there are many approaches to this. However, the current plugin package in Go does come with its fair share of headaches. Below is a side-by-side table listing the Go plugins’ pros and cons in its current state.</p>

<p>The basic shipping calculator will give you rates based on which shipping method and parcel weight you provide. You can support different shipping methods by adding new plugins, and the calculator will produce the rates and currency based on your preferred shipping method. The interface for a shipping method contains three functions, GetCurrency,&nbsp; CalculateRate, and Name.</p>

        <p>Last updated Feb. 3, 2014 — read <span id="post-views">25717</span> times</p>

        <p><strong>This post is adapted from <a href="https://mikeknoop.com/iowaconf-road-to-zapier">a talk I gave</a> at <a href="http://iowaconf.com/">iowaconf</a> October 2013</strong></p>

<p>I was one of three co-founders of <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. If you're unfamiliar with the origin story, we got started out of a <a href="http://columbia.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> in Columbia, Mo. in 2011.</p>

<p>The prompt for this talk was to describe “what you learned building Zapier”. The most obvious thing I could share is tactical advice or early anecdotes. Things like how we got our first dozen customers to pay us before we really had a product or how we almost missed our acceptance call into <a href="https://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I'm still leaning <em>a ton</em> through today. Startups are very much “trial-by-fire” as a first-time founder.</p>

<p>But the more I thought about that talk prompt, I realized the biggest thing I learned actually began way, way earlier. It's a lesson that applies equally to launching Zapier as to endeavors which lie beyond.</p>



<p>Growing up I've was always into tech and I loved building things (I originally wanted to be an architect when I thought that's what they did).</p>

<p>I learned how to build websites after borrowing a friend's “Learn HTML in 24 Hours” book. My goal was to build an AOL Instant Messenger profile for myself, which conveniently, could render actual HTML.</p>

<p>Later I learned how to code “hardcore” by picking up assembly language. I did this so I could write TI-83+ calculator games and play them during class (much to the dismay to my teachers growing up).</p>

<p>Towards the end of high school though, it was time to pick a major. Computer Science was the obvious shoe-in. But I didn't want to do it! I feared that I would burn out and not have time/energy for side projects.</p>

<p>So I decided instead to do Mechanical Engineering instead – also maybe not the best choice considering my goal outlined above but at least I wouldn't be coding 24/7 for school.</p>



<p>Facebook was just taking off during my freshman year of college. They launched their original developer platform that fall and I was instantly hooked.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of free time building apps. Like this one that you could use to request phone numbers from your fiends.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5f24a618be311e3ae7628cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or this one which was a developer toolkit, making it easy to embed Facebook-style form elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e45bf5828be311e3b0bb28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or even my last solo Facebook endeavor, a monitoring tool for the Facebook Platform, which peaked at a grand total of 1 paying user.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e35826a88be311e3982b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can probably guess: my ROI wasn't too great. But I was very active in the Facebook developer community and made a name for myself. Facebook reached out and asked if I'd like to become a community moderator. I have to imagine this was because of my community participation and not because they looked at any of my app analytics. </p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5897b478be311e3a69228cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This moderator gig led me to write developer columns for Inside Facebook and in combination, these two things generally kept my around the platform much longer than I otherwise should have.</p>

<p>It did turn out to be useful though.</p>



<p>I was applying for summer engineering internships after my Junior year of college. I applied about two dozen engineering firms in Missouri as well as a few web development gigs.</p>

<p>Of all resume's I sent out I only heard back from one place, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>, a VA loan lender based in Columbia Mo. I learned they wanted to build an app for military personnel to reconnect inside of Facebook.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e4ebb0e88be311e3864128cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I worked on Military Basebook for about a year. It peaked around 20,000 monthly active users but ultimately wasn't sticky enough. Around this time I learned a few things:</p>

<p><em>1. Facebook apps that aren't games just don't work well</em></p>

<p>Even today the most successful apps on Facebook are games. Users on Facebook just aren't in mindset to seek out utilities.</p>

<p><em>2. I didn't want to do the traditional engineering career</em></p>

<p>Although the sentiment had been brewing for a while, that summer was a turning point where I actively decided I would focus on side projects post college instead of seeking a full time job. I was going to keep throwing stuff at the wall and see if something stuck.</p>

<p>I began my mechanical engineering masters program (which I ended up dropping out of) as part of this strategy. I was able to secure a 2-year grant which paid for school living expenses. This left me with a lot of free time for my side projects.</p>



<p>Around the middle of my junior year I discovered <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. If you're unfamiliar, it is a lot like Reddit (HN actually came first) where stories and articles are upvoted to the frontpage. Usually people post about programming and startups.</p>

<p>One convention on Hacker News is called “Show HN” which is a way for people to show off their side projects and solicit feedback.</p>

<p>One “Show HN” caught my eye by a user called <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/?user=phpnode">phpnode</a> (thank you phpnode!). He launched a side project called <a href="http://zpr.io/6dM7.png">Hackernewsers</a> which was a map of users who used Hacker News.</p>

<p>The idea was simple. You submit your username, real name, and location and you get access to a map where you can see others who've done the same. I checked out Columbia Mo. and I saw something interesting – there was someone else in the area! It turns out that other person was this guy:</p>

<p>[Bryan Helmig]</p>

<p>I remember clicking through all the information I could find online about him. I found his <a href="http://bryanhelmig.com/">personal blog</a>, some of his <a href="http://rankiac.com/">side projects</a>, and even <a href="http://youtube.com/">his YouTube channel</a>. But the most important thing I learned was that he worked at same company I did, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>.</p>

<p>That was enough of a connection for me so I got in touch over Facebook. We met up several times that year for beers and wanted to work on something together.</p>



<p>Mizzou, the university I attended in Columbia, sent out a weekly email with things happening on campus and in the area. I usually auto-archived these. I must have been pretty bored the day I <a href="http://google.com/">opened this one</a>, but I'm glad I did. I found an enticing headline “Startup Weekend is Coming to Columbia”.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Startup Weekend but I knew I liked building things, I knew I liked startups, so maybe this is something I wanted to be a part of. I then discovered tickets cost $50 and was a bit turned off.</p>

<p>Maybe if I could find someone else going, it would be worth the money. So I messaged Bryan and he said he was going! I bought tickets later that night, and that's how I wound up at Columbia Missouri's first ever Startup Weekend.</p>

<p>At Startup Weekend I formally met <a href="http://wadefoster.net/">Wade Foster</a> who also happened to work at Veterans United. We got together and worked on the project that Bryan originally pitched as “API Mixer”. The idea was simple: make a tool that enables anyone (marketers, sales, HR, developers) to connect together two web services they use.</p>

<p>In true startup fashion we took to the back garage and got to work. The <a href="https://zapier.com/blog">story of Zapier</a> is still being written today.</p>



<p>When I look back on the decisions that lead me to Startup Weekend I am amazed how many times the proverbial train of life could have been derailed.</p>

<p>What if I hadn't opened that email? What if I never got into Facebook development? What if I hadn't worked at Veterans United?</p>

<p>In reminds me a lot of the game Plinko on The Price is Right. The one where the contestant drops the puck down a pegged board and it randomly makes it's way down to one of the buckets at the bottom with the winning bucket in the middle.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9ed525578be311e39e8a28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plinko"></p>

<p>The funny thing about plinko is, if you run sufficiently many trials, the middle bucket is actually the easiest to hit! The outcome follows a normal distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9dfcebde8be311e3ae7b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plink Distrobution"></p>

<p>The take away here is if you go through life making random decisions, statistically, you'll wind up in the middle. While in Plinko the middle is the best, in reality, the really exciting stuff happens at the edges of the board. That's where Zapier happened. And to get there you've got to purposely push yourself towards the outsides.</p>

<p>Although I didn't realize it at the time, there was a guiding principle for all my decisions. I was always putting myself out there, in uncomfortable, new situations that challenged my own status quo.</p>

<p>That's the road to the outside of the Plinko board. And that's the biggest thing I learned by creating Zapier.</p>

					<p>Deze week hebben we een stap gezet waarvan we dachten dat we hem nooit zouden moeten zetten: we hebben de NOS-logo`s laten verwijderen van de auto`s waarmee we elke dag op pad zijn om verslaggevers een werkplek te bieden en om radio- en televisieverbindingen met Hilversum te leggen. Voortaan zijn deze auto`s, kleine vrachtwagens eigenlijk, niet meer herkenbaar als auto`s van de NOS.</p>										<p>Helaas, het is nodig voor de veiligheid van de mensen die elke dag voor de NOS op pad zijn. We hebben er maanden over getwijfeld, we wilden het per se niet, want we willen als publieke journalistieke organisatie juist zichtbaar en aanspreekbaar zijn, maar het kan zo niet verder.</p>
<p>Vrijwel dagelijks worden collega`s die onderweg zijn, geconfronteerd met opgestoken middelvingers, er wordt afval naar ze gegooid, ze worden afgesneden op de snelweg en een enkeling remt zelfs hard vlak voor onze auto`s. Als zo`n NOS-auto stil staat om in te werken, wordt dat onmogelijk gemaakt door erop te bonzen. Als we worden uitgescholden en of in meer of mindere mate bedreigd, valt dat al bijna niet meer op.</p>
<p>En het gaat niet alleen om wat er feitelijk gebeurt, maar zeker ook om de angst dat je wat overkomt of wordt aangedaan.</p>
<p>Eerder namen we het besluit standaard bewaking meesturen als we verslag doen van publieksmanifestaties en nu dan de logo`s eraf. Zo diep zijn we gezonken en het verbijsterende is: het is allemaal in korte tijd snel anders geworden. Deze discussie kwam in het voorjaar op, maar toen nog zeiden de technici dat ze logo`s zeker niet kwijt wilden. Herkenbaarheid en trots op het bedrijf waar ze voor werken, gaven toen nog de doorslag.</p>
<p>De journalistiek ligt onder vuur van mensen en groeperingen, die alleen hun eigen wereld willen terugzien, elk ander perspectief onmogelijk proberen te maken en daarmee de persvrijheid aantasten. Dit besluit is een nederlaag voor de NOS, maar vooral voor de journalistiek. Bij <a href="https://www.persveilig.nl/">Persveilig</a> zijn binnen een jaar meer dan 100 meldingen van agressie tegen journalisten binnengekomen. De journalistiek is een fundament voor onze democratie, moet onbelemmerd kunnen functioneren en daarin gesteund worden. Juist nu en veel meer dan gebeurt.</p>

<p><span>[Updated on 2018-09-30: thanks to Yoonju, we have this post translated in <a href="https://github.com/yjucho1/articles/blob/master/fromGANtoWGAN/readme.md">Korean</a>!]</span>
<br>
<span>[Updated on 2019-04-18: this post is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08994">arXiv</a>.]</span></p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">Generative adversarial network</a> (GAN) has shown great results in many generative tasks to replicate the real-world rich content such as images, human language, and music. It is inspired by game theory: two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time. However, it is rather challenging to train a GAN model, as people are facing issues like training instability or failure to converge.</p>

<p>Here I would like to explain the maths behind the generative adversarial network framework,  why it is hard to be trained, and finally introduce a modified version of GAN intended to solve the training difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">Kullback–Leibler and Jensen–Shannon Divergence</h2>

<p>Before we start examining GANs closely, let us first review two metrics for quantifying the similarity between two probability distributions.</p>

<p>(1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">KL (Kullback–Leibler) divergence</a> measures how one probability distribution \(p\) diverges from a second expected probability distribution \(q\).</p><p>

\[D_{KL}(p \| q) = \int_x p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx\]

</p><p>\(D_{KL}\) achieves the minimum zero when \(p(x)\) == \(q(x)\) everywhere.</p>

<p>It is noticeable according to the formula that KL divergence is asymmetric. In cases where \(p(x)\) is close to zero, but \(q(x)\) is significantly non-zero, the \(q\)’s effect is disregarded. It could cause buggy results when we just want to measure the similarity between two equally important distributions.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Jensen–Shannon Divergence</a> is another measure of similarity between two probability distributions, bounded by \([0, 1]\). JS divergence is symmetric (yay!) and more smooth. Check this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Jensen-Shannon-divergence-used-more-often-than-the-Kullback-Leibler-since-JS-is-symmetric-thus-possibly-a-better-indicator-of-distance">Quora post</a> if you are interested in reading more about the comparison between KL divergence and JS divergence.</p><p>

\[D_{JS}(p \| q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p \| \frac{p + q}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(q \| \frac{p + q}{2})\]

</p><p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/KL_JS_divergence.png" alt="KL and JS divergence"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 1. Given two Gaussian distribution, \(p\) with mean=0 and std=1 and \(q\) with mean=1 and std=1. The average of two distributions is labelled as \(m=(p+q)/2\). KL divergence \(D_{KL}\) is asymmetric but JS divergence \(D_{JS}\) is symmetric.</em></p>

<p>Some believe (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05101.pdf">Huszar, 2015</a>) that one reason behind GANs’ big success is switching the loss function from asymmetric KL divergence in traditional maximum-likelihood approach to symmetric JS divergence. We will discuss more on this point in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="generative-adversarial-network-gan">Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</h2>

<p>GAN consists of two models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A discriminator \(D\) estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It works as a critic and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the real ones.</li>
  <li>A generator \(G\) outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input \(z\) (\(z\) brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution so that its generative samples can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/GAN.png" alt="Generative adversarial network"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 2. Architecture of a generative adversarial network. (Image source: <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-adversarial-networks-hot-topic-machine-learning.html">www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-…-learning.html</a>)</em></p>

<p>These two models compete against each other during the training process: the generator \(G\) is trying hard to trick the discriminator, while the critic model \(D\) is trying hard not to be cheated. This interesting zero-sum game between two models motivates both to improve their functionalities.</p>

<p>Given,</p>

      <td>Data distribution over real sample \(x\)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On one hand, we want to make sure the discriminator \(D\)’s decisions over real data are accurate by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\). Meanwhile, given a fake sample \(G(z), z \sim p_z(z)\), the discriminator is expected to output a probability, \(D(G(z))\), close to zero by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the generator is trained to increase the chances of \(D\) producing a high probability for a fake example, thus to minimize \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>When combining both aspects together, \(D\) and \(G\) are playing a <strong>minimax game</strong> in which we should optimize the following loss function:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\min_G \max_D L(D, G) 
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \\
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g(x)} [\log(1 - D(x)]
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>(\(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\) has no impact on \(G\) during gradient descent updates.)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-optimal-value-for-d">What is the optimal value for D?</h3>

<p>Now we have a well-defined loss function. Let’s first examine what is the best value for \(D\).</p><p>

\[L(G, D) = \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D(x)) \bigg) dx\]

</p><p>Since we are interested in what is the best value of \(D(x)\) to maximize \(L(G, D)\), let us label</p><p>

\[\tilde{x} = D(x), 
A=p_{r}(x), 
B=p_g(x)\]

</p><p>And then what is inside the integral (we can safely ignore the integral because \(x\) is sampled over all the possible values) is:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
f(\tilde{x}) 
&amp; = A log\tilde{x} + B log(1-\tilde{x}) \\

\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}}
&amp; = A \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{\tilde{x}} - B \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{1 - \tilde{x}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} (\frac{A}{\tilde{x}} - \frac{B}{1-\tilde{x}}) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{A - (A + B)\tilde{x}}{\tilde{x} (1 - \tilde{x})} \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus, set \(\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}} = 0\), we get the best value of the discriminator: \(D^*(x) = \tilde{x}^* = \frac{A}{A + B} = \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r}(x) + p_g(x)} \in [0, 1]\).</p>

<p>Once the generator is trained to its optimal, \(p_g\) gets very close to \(p_{r}\). When \(p_g = p_{r}\), \(D^*(x)\) becomes \(1/2\).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-global-optimal">What is the global optimal?</h3>

<p>When both \(G\) and \(D\) are at their optimal values, we have \(p_g = p_{r}\) and \(D^*(x) = 1/2\) and the loss function becomes:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
L(G, D^*) 
&amp;= \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D^*(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D^*(x)) \bigg) dx \\
&amp;= \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_{r}(x) dx + \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_g(x) dx \\
&amp;= -2\log2
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="what-does-the-loss-function-represent">What does the loss function represent?</h3>

<p>According to the formula listed in the <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/08/20/from-GAN-to-WGAN.html#kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">previous section</a>, JS divergence between \(p_{r}\) and \(p_g\) can be computed as:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) 
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{r} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{g} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_{r}(x) \log \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) + \\&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_g(x) \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log4 + L(G, D^*) \bigg)
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus,</p><p>

\[L(G, D^*) = 2D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) - 2\log2\]

</p><p>Essentially the loss function of GAN quantifies the similarity between the generative data distribution \(p_g\) and the real sample distribution \(p_{r}\) by JS divergence when the discriminator is optimal. The best \(G^*\) that replicates the real data distribution leads to the minimum \(L(G^*, D^*) = -2\log2\) which is aligned with equations above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Other Variations of GAN</strong>: There are many variations of GANs in different contexts or designed for different tasks. For example, for semi-supervised learning, one idea is to update the discriminator to output real class labels, \(1, \dots, K-1\), as well as one fake class label \(K\). The generator model aims to trick the discriminator to output a classification label smaller than \(K\).</p>

<h2 id="problems-in-gans">Problems in GANs</h2>

<p>Although GAN has shown great success in the realistic image generation, the training is not easy; The process is known to be slow and unstable.</p>

<h3 id="hard-to-achieve-nash-equilibrium">Hard to achieve Nash equilibrium</h3>

<p><a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6125-improved-techniques-for-training-gans.pdf">Salimans et al. (2016)</a> discussed the problem with GAN’s gradient-descent-based training procedure. Two models are trained simultaneously to find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> to a two-player non-cooperative game. However, each model updates its cost independently with no respect to another player in the game. Updating the gradient of both models concurrently cannot guarantee a convergence.</p>

<p>Let’s check out a simple example to better understand why it is difficult to find a Nash equilibrium in an non-cooperative game. Suppose one player takes control of \(x\) to minimize \(f_1(x) = xy\), while at the same time the other player constantly updates \(y\) to minimize \(f_2(y) = -xy\).</p>

<p>Because \(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} = y\) and \(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} = -x\), we update \(x\) with \(x-\eta \cdot y\) and \(y\) with \(y+ \eta \cdot x\) simulitanously in one iteration, where \(\eta\) is the learning rate. Once \(x\) and \(y\) have different signs, every following gradient update causes huge oscillation and the instability gets worse in time, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Previously I’ve decided to implement a rather basic <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/">raycasting engine in ClojureScript</a>.
It was a lot of fun, an interesting experience, and ClojureScript was awesome.
I’ve implemented small <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/#labyrinth-game">labyrinth game</a>, and thought about adding more features to the engine, such as camera shake, and wall height change.
But when I’ve started working on these, I quickly understood, that I’d like to move on to something more interesting, like real 3D rendering engine, that also uses rays.</p>
<p>Obviously, my first though was about writing a ray-tracer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This technique is wide known, and gained a lot of traction recently.
With native hardware support for ray tracing, a lot of games are using it, and there are a lot of tutorials teaching how to implement one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
In short, we cast a bunch of rays in 3D space, and calculate their trajectories, looking for what ray will hit and bounce off.
Different materials have different bounce properties, and by tracing rays from camera to the source of light, we can imitate illumination.
There are also a lot of different approaches how to calculate bouncing, e.g. for global illumination, and ambient light, but I’ve felt that it is a rather complicated task, for a weekend post.
And unlike raycasting, most ray-tracers require polygonal information in order to work, where raycasting only need to know wall start and end points.</p>
<p>I’ve wanted a similar approach for 3D rendering, where we specify an object in terms of it’s mathematical representation.
Like for sphere, we’ll just specify coordinate of a center, and a radius, and our rays will find intersection points with it, providing us a sufficient data to draw this sphere on screen.
And recently, I’ve read about a similar technique, that uses rays for drawing on screen, but instead of casting infinite rays as in raycasting, it marches a ray in terms of steps.
And it also uses a special trick, to make this process very optimized, therefore we can use it for rendering real 3D objects.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to structure this post similarly to the one about raycasting, so this will be another long-read, often more about Fennel rather than raymarching, but at the end I promise that we’ll get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/end-result.png"> 
</figure>

<p>So, just as in raycasting, first we need to do is to understand how raymarching engine works <em>on paper</em>.</p>
<h2 id="raymarching-basics">Raymarching basics</h2>
<p>Raymarching can be illustrated similarly to raycaster, except it requires more steps until we could render our image.
First, we need a camera, and an object to look at:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Our first step would to cast a ray, however, unlike with raycasting, we’ll cast a portion of a ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-short-ray.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We then check, if the ray intersects with the sphere.
It’s not, so we do one more step:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-two-steps.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>It’s not intersecting yet, so we repeat again:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-ray-overshoot.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Oops, ray overshoot, and is now inside the sphere.
This is not really good option for us, as we want for our rays to end directly at the object’s surface, without calculating intersection point with the object itself.
We can fix this by casting shorter ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-small-rays.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>However, this is very inefficient!
And besides, if we’ll change the angle a bit or move the camera, we will overshoot again.
Which means that we’ll either have incorrect result, or require a very small step size, which will blow up computation process.
How we can fix this?</p>
<h3 id="distance-estimation">Distance estimation</h3>
<p>The solution to this is a signed distance function, or a so called Distance Estimator.
Imagine if we knew how far we are from the object at any point of time?
This would mean that we can shoot a ray of this length in any direction and still don’t hit anything.
Let’s add another object to the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/scene-with-two-objects.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s draw two circles, which will represent distances from the objects, to the point from where we’ll cast rays:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/distances.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that there are two circles, and one is bigger than another.
This means, that if we choose the shortest safe distance, we can safely cast ray in any direction and not overshoot anything.
For example, let’s cast a ray towards the square:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/ray-in-safe-zone.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that we haven’t reached the square, but more importantly we did not overshoot it.
Now we need to march the ray again, but what distance should it cover?
To answer this question, we need to take another distance estimation from ray end to the objects in the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/second-safe-march.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Once again we choose shorter distance, and march towards the square, then get the distance again, and repeat the whole process:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/another-safe-match.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that with each step the distance to the object becomes smaller, and thus we will never overshoot the object.
However this also means, that we will take a lot of really small steps, until we finally fully hit the object, if we ever do.
This is not a good idea, because it is even more inefficient than using fixed distance, and produces too accurate results, which we don’t really need.
So instead of marching up until we exactly hit the object, we will march <em>enough</em> times.
E.g. until the distance to the object is small enough, then there’s no real point to continue marching, as it is clear that we will hit the object soon.
But this also means, that if the ray goes near the edge of an object, we do a lot of expensive steps of computing distance estimations.</p>
<p>Here’s a ray that is parallel to the side of the square, and marches towards the circle:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/expensive-marching.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We do a lot of seemingly pointless measurements, and if a ray was closer to the square’s side, we would do even more steps.
However this also means, that we can use this data (since we’re already computed it) to render such things as glow, or ambient occlusion.
But more on this later.</p>
<p>Once ray hit an object we have all the data we need.
Ray represents a point on the screen, and the more rays we cast the higher resolution of our image will be.
And since we’re not using triangles to represent objects, our spheres will always be smooth, no matter how close we are to it, because there’s no polygons involved.</p>
<p>This is basically it.
Ray marching is quite simple concept, just like raycaster, although it’s a bit more complicated, as we do have to compute things in 3D space now.
So let’s begin implementing it by installing required tools, and setting up the project.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>As you know from the title we will use two main tools to create ray-marcher, which are <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>, a free game engine, and <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a> the programming language.
I’ve chosen Fennel, because it is a Lisp like language, that compiles to Lua, and I’m quite a fan of Lisps.
But we also needed to draw somewhere, and I know no GUI toolkit for Lua.
But there is LÖVE - a game engine that runs Lua code, which is capable on running on all systems, thus a perfect candidate for our task.</p>
<p>Installation steps may differ per operating system, so please refer to manuals<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
At the time of writing this post I’m using Fedora GNU/Linux, so for me it means:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ sudo dnf install love luarocks readline-devel
$ luarocks install --local fennel
$ luarocks install --local readline <span># requires readline-devel</span>
$ <span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.luarocks/bin"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It’s better to permanently add <code>$HOME/luarocks/bin</code> (or another path, if your installation differs) to the <code>PATH</code> variable in your shell, in order to be able to use installed utilities without specifying full path every time.
You can test if everything is installed correctly, by running <code>fennel</code> in you command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ fennel
Welcome to Fennel 0.5.0 on Lua 5.3!
Use (doc something) to view documentation.
&gt;&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>For other distributions installation steps may vary, and for Windows, I think it’s safe to skip the <code>readline</code> part, which is fully optional, but makes editing in a REPL a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Once everything is installed, let’s create the project directory, and the <code>main.fnl</code> file, where we will write our code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ mkdir love_raymarching
$ <span>cd</span> love_raymarching
$ touch main.fnl
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!
We can test if everything works by adding this code to <code>main.fnl</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>fn </span><span>love.draw</span> []
  (<span>love.graphics.print</span> <span>"It works!"</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can compile it with <code>fennel --compile main.fnl &gt; main.lua</code>, thus producing the <code>main.lua</code> file, and run <code>love .</code> (dot is intentional, it indicates current directory).</p>
<p>A window should appear, with white text <code>It works!</code> in upper left corner:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/love-works.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Now we can begin implementing our raymarcher.</p>
<h2 id="scene-setup">Scene setup</h2>
<p>Just as in raycaster, we need a camera that will shoot rays, and some objects to look at.
Let’s begin by creating a camera object, that will store coordinates and rotation information.
We can do so, by using <code>var</code> to declare a variable that is local to our file, and that we can later change with <code>set</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>var </span><span>camera</span> {<span>:pos</span> [0.0 0.0 0.0]
             <span>:x-rotate</span> 0.0
             <span>:z-rotate</span> 0.0})
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Lisps, and especially Clojure, let me quickly explain what this syntax is.
If you know this stuff, feel free to <a href="#org6f2d291">skip this part</a>.</p>
<p>We start by using a <code>var</code> special form, that binds a value to a name like this: <code>(var name value)</code>.
So if we start the REPL, using <code>fennel</code> command in the shell, and write <code>(var a 40)</code>, a new variable <code>a</code> will be created.
We then can check, that it has the desired value by typing <code>a</code>, and pressing return:</p>
<p>We can then alter the contents of this variable by using <code>set</code> special form, which works like this <code>(set name new-value)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>set </span><span>a</span> (<span>+ </span><span>a</span> 2))
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
42
</code></pre></div><p>Now to curly and square brackets.
Everything enclosed in curly braces is a hashmap.
We can use any Lua value as our key, and the most common choice is a string, but Fennel has additional syntax for defining keys - a colon followed by a word: <code>:a</code>.
This is called a keyword, and in Fennel it is essentially the same as <code>"a"</code>, but we don’t need to write a pair of quotes.
However keywords can’t contain spaces, and some other symbols.</p>
<p>So writing this <code>{:a 0 :b 2 :c :hello}</code> in the REPL will make a new table, that holds three key value pairs, which we can later get with another syntax - the dot <code>.</code>.
Combining it with <code>var</code>, we can see that it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>var </span><span>m</span> {<span>:a</span> 1 <span>:b</span> 2 <span>:c</span> <span>:hello</span>})
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>. </span><span>m</span> <span>:b</span>)
2
</code></pre></div><p>There’s also a shorthand for this …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p><em>This article is based on a book chapter from my upcoming book <strong>“From One to Zero: A Minimalistic Approach to Programming”</strong>. </em></p>



<p>My <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/" title="Subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">programming students</a> often write in with their struggles and failures. Many students ultimately overcome their struggles—but a large percentage of them <strong><em>give up their programming ambitions</em></strong> after realizing how hard creating software can be. These students started with the goal of becoming professional coders, but, ultimately, they missed that target. </p>



<p>After thousands of personal conversations with these students, it became apparent that many new coders don’t fail because they don’t know one or the other Python feature or because they lack technical skills, intelligence, or even talent. </p>



<p>These are not the underlying reasons <strong><em>why </em></strong>they fail. </p>



<p>Instead, they fail because they are<strong> overwhelmed by the complexity lurking everywhere in programming</strong>. The complexity causes them to throw in the towel. This is unfortunate because there are many ways to mitigate the harmful effects of complexity in programming. In the previous chapter, you’ve already learned some strategies about the <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/the-80-20-principle-in-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="The 80/20 Principle in Programming"><strong>80/20 principle</strong></a> (Focus on the vital few and sacrifice the trivial many!).</p>



<p>In this chapter, we’re going to have a comprehensive look at this important and highly underexplored topic. <strong>What exactly is complexity?</strong> Where does it occur? How does it look like?</p>



<p>Let’s start with a quick overview—there’s significant complexity in selecting the right</p>



<ul><li>programming language among dozens of popular languages,</li><li>coding project to work on—from thousands of open-source projects and myriads of problems,</li><li>libraries within a language (<a href="https://blog.finxter.com/why-does-the-scikit-learn-library-use-a-trailing-underscore-convention-for-attribute-names/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Why Does the Scikit-learn Library use a Trailing Underscore Convention for Attribute Names?">scikit-learn</a> vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/numpy-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="NumPy Tutorial – Everything You Need to Know to Get Started">NumPy </a>vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/2-min-computer-science-papers-tensorflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[2-min CS Papers] A Short Introduction to the TensorFlow System">TensorFlow</a>),</li><li>emerging technologies to “bet on”—Alexa apps, smartphone apps, browser-based web apps, integrated Facebook or WeChat apps, virtual reality apps—and</li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">coding editor</a> such as PyCharm, IDLE, and Atom.</li></ul>



<p>Given the great confusion caused by these sources of complexity, it’s no surprise that<strong><em> “How to start?”</em></strong> is one of the most common questions from programming beginners. </p>



<p>To answer the question right away, the best way to start is <strong><em>not </em></strong>by choosing a programming book and reading over all <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/python-crash-course/" title="Python Programming Tutorial [+Cheat Sheets]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syntactical features</a> of the programming language. Surprisingly, these coding books sell well—even I am a<a href="https://coffeebreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://coffeebreakpython.com/"> seller of such books</a>. However, interacting with thousands of programming students personally I realized that many ambitious students buy programming books as a commitment device to put the learning task on their ToDo lists—if they’ve spent money on the book, they better read it or the investment will be lost. But as so many other tasks on their ToDo lists, reading a programming book is seldomly one to be completed. </p>



<p><strong>Many students buy these programming tutorial books but very few actually read them.</strong></p>



<p>So, what is the <strong><em>best way to start to learn to program</em></strong>? In my opinion, the best way to start is to choose a practical code project—a simple one if you’re a beginner—and push it to completion. </p>



<ul><li>Don’t read coding books before you do this. </li><li>Don’t read random tutorials on the web. </li><li>Don’t scroll through endless feeds on StackOverflow. </li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Just set up the project and start coding with the limited skills you have</em></strong> and your common sense. </p>



<p>It’s okay if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you will gradually increase your understanding. You read books and articles only to make progress on the project in front of you. By diving into the process of finishing your first project, you need to solve a number of highly relevant problems: </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">Which code editor should you use? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/install-python-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Install Python on Windows?

<p>By answering these questions, you gradually build a well-rounded skill set of a practitioner. Over time, you’ll answer these questions better and better. Your speed and skill to solve these problems will grow. You’ll be able to solve similar problems much bigger and you’ll create your internal database of programming patterns and conceptual insights. Even advanced coders learn and improve with the exact same process—only the coding projects have become much larger and more complicated.</p>



<p>Let’s assume you adopt this <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-start-your-freelancing-business-on-the-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[7 Steps] How to Start Your Freelancing Business on the Side?">project-based learning approach</a>. You focus on a single project and work on it for a considerable amount of time. What is your biggest enemy now? You guessed it: <strong><em>complexity</em></strong>.</p>



<p>You’ll struggle with complexity in:</p>



<ul><li>finding bugs in ever-growing codebases,</li><li>understanding code components and how they interact,</li><li>choosing the right feature to be implemented next,</li><li>understanding the mathematical and conceptual basics of the code.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Complexity is everywhere</strong>, at every stage of a project that comes to life. And the hidden costs of this complexity are very tangible: coders who are just starting out throw in the towel and the projects never see the light of day. The beginner argues: <em>“coding is too difficult for me”</em> and he truly believes it—even though nothing can be further from the truth.</p>



<p>The root of the problem is overwhelming complexity and a lack of focus. So, the question arises: </p>



<p><strong><em>How to solve complexity and a lack of focus?</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Minimalism" width="844" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>The answer is straightforward, and I’ve already stressed it a few times in this book: <strong>minimalism</strong>. Seek simplicity and focus – in every stage of the coding cycle. I want you to take this one concept out of the book: Take a radically minimalistic position in every area you’ll encounter in the programming space. If this book can convince you to take more extreme measures to increase your focus, it has accomplished its mission!</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper into the concept of complexity to develop an understanding of one of the great enemies of your coding productivity.</p>




<h2><span id="What_is_Complexity"></span>What is Complexity?<span></span></h2>



<p>In different fields, the term complexity comes with different meanings. Sometimes, it’s strictly defined, such as in computational complexity of a computer program that provides a means to analyze a given code function for varying inputs. Other times, it’s loosely defined as the amount or structure of interactions between system components. But in this book, we’re going to use it in a more generic way.</p>



<p>The Merriam Webster dictionary defines complexity as <em>“something complex”</em>. The term complex is defined as <em>“a whole made up of complicated […] parts”</em>. If you resolve the term complicated—<em>“difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>—you end up with the following rough definition:</p>



<p><strong>Complexity</strong>: <em>“a whole, made up of parts, that is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>.</p>



<p>This is how we use the term complexity in this book. Complexity describes a whole system or entity. It is difficult to explain or describe. Because of its difficulty, complexity causes struggle and confusion. When confronted with complexity, people find themselves cognitively unable to comprehend the deeper meaning, implications, or effects of “the whole”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Complexity" width="450" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>They cannot see the big picture—complexity is the enemy of clarity, closure, and predictability, because a complex system behaves in highly unpredictable ways. Where do you find complexity? You’ll find it everywhere, because real-world systems are messy: A highly interrelated web of causes and effects that obfuscates the behavior of a real system, and that is impossible to decode for individuals who are themselves caught in this complex web. Like a differential equation, the output of one system feeds into another system’s input which, in turn, feeds back into the first system as an input. Examples of highly complex systems are the stock market, social trends, emerging political viewpoints, and big computer programs with hundreds of thousands of lines of code—such as the Windows operating system.</p>



<p>If you are a coder, you are especially prone to overwhelming complexity. Let’s dive into different sources of complexity in the field of programming:</p>



<ul><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li><li>Complexity in Software and Algorithmic Theory</li><li>Complexity in Learning</li><li>Complexity in Processes</li><li>Complexity in Social Networks</li><li>Complexity in Your Daily Life</li><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li></ul>



<p>The best way to learn and create lasting value is through your participation or initiation of a real-world project. But how does it look like when a real-world project comes to life? Let’s dive into the different stages of the project lifecycle: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, and Deployment (see Figure 1).</p>



<p><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: A software project comes to life – the project lifecycle consists of six conceptual phases: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, Deployment.</em></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="604" height="340" src="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png" data-src="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png 604w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-150x84.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" srcset="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png 604w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-150x84.png 150w"></figure></div>



<p>Figure 1 shows the software development life cycle consisting of six phases. Even if you’re working on a very small software project, you’re likely going through all six phases of the software development lifecycle. Next, you’ll quickly dive into all six phases—and how complexity has a significant impact on every one of them.</p>



<h3><span id="Planning"></span>Planning<span></span></h3>



<p>The first stage of the software development life cycle is the planning phase. From software engineering literature, you may know this as <strong><em>requirement analysis</em></strong>. The purpose of this phase is to determine how the end product will look like. A successful planning phase leads to a strictly defined set of required features to deliver to the customer or the end user.</p>



<p>The planning phase solves a multi-dimensional problem where different departments and functions must collaborate to determine the optimal set of features of the software. A number of factors must be taken into consideration: the costs of building a feature, the risk of not being able to successfully implement the feature, the expected value for the end user, marketing and sales implications, maintainability, scalability, legal restrictions and many more.</p>



<p>This phase is crucial because it can save you from massive wastages of downstream energy in the following phases. Business owners know that <strong><em>capital allocation</em></strong> (or …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Pursuing a non-conventional path</h3><p>Between 2015 and 2020 I have participated in <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> tournaments. Being involved in these tournaments has led me to a <strong>very profitable journey</strong>: I made around $350k during these years.</p><p>Many people have reached out to me and asked how I did it. I decided to write this post to inspire others with this <strong>non-conventional path</strong>.</p><h4>Selling a Trading Algorithm</h4><p>In 2015 <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> was one of my interests. This is how I came across <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, a platform that provides data and tools so anyone can develop and test trading algorithms. After learning the basics and playing around with the platform I decided to submit an algorithm to their recently created tournament.</p><p>The algorithm was pretty basic but surprisingly it remained in the <strong>top 10 for a few weeks</strong>. I received many messages: companies suggesting to join them as a Financial Quant, people interested in my approach, and a few offers from people interested in buying the algorithm.</p><p>One of those potential buyers was particularly interested, shockingly enough, even after I explained him how simple my algorithm was. I eventually shared the code with him for free. Still, he expressed his desire to send me the amount he offered in the first instance. And that's how I made <strong>the first $2k out of participating in ML/financial tournaments.</strong></p><h4>Getting The Dream Job</h4><p>During these weeks I exchanged many emails with Apple employees, financial quants, people from Europe, Asia, or America. But the best interaction came from a guy from my town. He was building his own trading algorithm and was interested in my approach. I meet him a couple of times. Obviously, his knowledge was years ahead of where I was at that time.</p><p>Those meetings were very productive, especially for me. After discussing with him about our personal and professional interests, and how difficult it was to find good jobs in our city, he introduced me to my next employer. Of course, I was not aware of it at that time. He introduced me to the CEO of an ad-tech company, and at first glance I saw many things in common between this sector and <strong>high-frequency trading</strong>. The offered position (not publicly opened at that time) would also allow me to face and try to solve many machine learning, big data and architectural challenges.</p><p>After a few weeks and a couple of meetings, I decided that the company was a really good fit, a place where I would continue professionally growing and developing as a <strong>data scientist and engineer</strong>.</p><p>During years we worked on building a solid <strong>platform that led us to be acquired in 2018</strong>. The experience was great and the outcome even better. Including the exit bonus I made a big sum during this period.</p><h4>The Altcoins Trading Madness</h4><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5c9snCN/Cf-DCZLm-WEAACt-ZS.jpg" alt="Numerai Tournament Leaderboard"></figure><p>In 2016, I discovered the <a href="https://numer.ai/tournament">Numerai Tournament</a>, "the hardest data science tournament on the planet" as they claim. Numerai is a weekly global <strong>data science tournament</strong> to solve the stock market. Data scientists work with clean, regularized, and obfuscated datasets provided by Numerai to create machine-learning models to predict the stock market. <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> builds a meta model of the most unique and contributive predictions, and uses this to command the capital in its global equity hedge fund.</p><p>In early 2016 I had finished a <strong>few rounds in good spots</strong>, as you can see in the image. After a few months of actively participating, I ended 2016 with around 0.5 BTC. It was cool but it required too much of my time. I had other priorities, so I withdrew the earnings and left the tournament.</p><p>Almost a year later a post about a Numerai airdrop came across my timeline. After login back to my account I discovered I received 1800 NMR.</p><p>At that time, the amount was valued around $30k, so I initially decided to withdraw almost everything, but something changed my mind and I started <strong>buying and selling altcoins</strong>. After some back and forth, and some lucky movements, I ended accumulating a wallet valued around $100k.</p><p>2017 was arriving at his end and I took <strong>the last lucky movement</strong>, I withdrew half of that sum a few weeks before the bitcoin crash. I still hold the other half but it wasn't easy to stick to that decision during 2018, while cryptos prices continued decreasing.</p><h4>The Compound Effect</h4><p>In July 2018, I came back to Numerai Tournament. I made some submissions but I didn't take it seriously again until mid-2019.</p><p>Since then I have a <strong>cumulative return of +141%</strong>. I have built an algorithm with an average weekly return of +2%, which taking into account the compounding effect it translates to <strong>+180% annualized total return</strong>.</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>I'm going to continue participating in the Numerai Tournament, if everything continues as it is now, it would provide a good income without requiring much effort. I will also continue taking <strong>small bets</strong>, experimenting with other projects, continue doing things I like, and <strong>learning in the process</strong>.</p><p>I share similar histories in Twitter, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/jrdi">follow me there</a> as I continue to document my journey.</p></div></div></div>]]>

October 20, 2020 | https://blog.ueber.io/post/monetizing-open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.ueber.io/post/monetizing-open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We double down on our open source projects without knowing how we make money with it. Open source software is accessible for free, so how can we make it sustainable? Let’s look at what could work.</p>
<p>Too many open source projects die because developers burn out to deliver fantastic software in their free time. That’s not how it should be, so what’s the alternative? We researched the topic and concluded there is not that one answer to the question.</p>
<p>What works for you depends on your project’s type, what you want to do, who you develop the software for, and many more things. Here is a list of ideas you can try or even combine to make money with your open source projects. Hopefully, that helps you to free more time for the things you love to work on.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>People are kind, so why not adding a donate button to your README? That’s an easy way to get a little money for your work. Unfortunately, that didn’t work for us. We asked for donations for our work on tiptap, a popular package that took us a few hundred hours to develop.</p>
<p>Hundreds of developers, companies, and even a few big corporations use it, but we earned less than $300 through PayPal donations over the last three years. Don’t get me wrong, we are very thankful for every dollar, but this makes an hourly rate of less than $1. That’s not sustainable, and not enough to work less on client projects and more on the bespoken project.</p>
<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>Your source code can stay open source, but add a license that requires people to pay for permission to use it in their projects. And to keep it fair, you can exclude non-commercial projects, non-profit organizations, students, and other open source projects.</p>
<p>Note, it might be hard to enforce the license for publicly accessible source code.</p>
<h2 id="goodwill-licenses">Goodwill licenses</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to waste time enforcing a license, you could sell a goodwill license. It’s in between donations and regular licenses, where you kindly ask the users of your project to pay. But inside companies, it’s easier to argue for paying for a license than for a donation.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>Some developers or companies need support to use your software. You can offer them support contracts, e. g. to promise a short response time for bug reports or availability for calls. Some companies require this level of support, some will use it extensively, and some won’t ever use it.</p>
<p>Offering support can work well for teams but can be a distraction from the work they are good at for single developers.</p>
<h2 id="contracting">Contracting</h2>
<p>If you open sourced something like a complex library, companies might want to hire you to implement your solution in their system. They know that you are the expert for the software you’ve written and happily pay you, even if it’s more than an average freelancer rate.</p>
<p>If you enjoy open source because you didn’t want to work with clients, that’s probably not for you. On the other hand, you’ll always use your code, which will help better understand the needs to implement your software.</p>
<h2 id="dual-licensing">Dual licensing</h2>
<p>Your software can have multiple licenses. For example, a basic version can be free for everyone, while another version, probably more tailored to what companies need, can be licensed differently.</p>
<p>Your publicly accessible software still allows collaboration. You would probably want to keep the advanced version closed to enforce the license. Keep in mind that maintaining different versions of software in parallel is more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="freemium">Freemium</h2>
<p>Also, consider offering a free version for everyone and add a few benefits for professional use that are only available for paying users.</p>
<p>Those extra benefits can be access to more features/plugins or other things like a community with restricted access.</p>
<h2 id="managed-hosting">Managed hosting</h2>
<p>If your software needs hosting and can be self-hosted, consider offering a managed hosting solution. Many people don’t want to operate their instance and happily pay you to do that for them.</p>
<p>You need to develop something to sell it, provision new instances, and maintain them. It’s a very fair approach and can work well, as you’ll always have people paying for convenience.</p>

<p>There are so many platforms tailored to easily offer sponsorship subscriptions to your users that you should think about adding this. But be aware that it’s the same as with donations. You won’t get many sponsors, but it’s recurring revenue that can help you feel safe.</p>
<h2 id="day-job">Day job</h2>
<p>Some companies make open source part of your day job. If you don’t need to work on an own project, but love a regular job’s safety, consider looking for such an employer.</p>
<p>By the way, we’re looking for a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/frontend-engineer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">frontend engineer</a> and a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/php-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PHP developer</a>, both roles include working on existing and new open source projects.</p>

<p>People always request features. Try turning feature requests into sponsored work, and offer to add those features in exchange for money. If multiple users or companies ask for the same functionality, you can even offer to share the development costs. Don’t forget to mention your sponsors in the release notes!</p>
<h2 id="bounties">Bounties</h2>
<p>Bounties enable users to attach money to a bug report. In most cases, that’s only a few dollars, but it doesn’t have to be you working on it. It can also motivate contributors to help you with the maintenance, which is cool too.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsorware/docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sponsorware</a> is a way to offer sponsors early-access to private repositories. When you reach a certain number of sponsors, you can open source the project and make it available to everyone.</p>
<p>It will help if you start new projects regularly and have an audience that can’t wait to test them.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>You can use your open source work as marketing for yourself and build up an audience. It takes time and doesn’t make you money from that alone, but it’s a chance to sell something additional. You probably know what your followers want, so it can be great to build something for them and make money with that.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra work on top of your open source projects. You should consider this if you are very active on social media anyway.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>You are the expert for your software, so I’d want to learn more about your software. I prefer to get that educational content from you. Consider publishing an ebook or a video course that explains your software in all details and helps people use it.</p>
<h2 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>With an existing audience interested in your software, there is a good chance people are willing to pay you upfront to work on your project. It’s an excellent approach for something tangible, like a significant rewrite, a big shift in the development, or any other effort the community is willing to support.</p>
<h2 id="ads">Ads</h2>
<p>If you’ve got widespread documentation with thousands of page views every month, you’ll be able to put ads on it and earn money with that.</p>
<p>It’s not what we like to do because it’s little money to sell people’s privacy using your software. That said, some companies try to take an ethical approach to ads.</p>
<h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>
<p>If your software has a brand and people identify with it, a shop might work well for you. You can sell stickers, shirts, caps, posters, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Those products still cost you money, so you’ll only earn a part of what the customer pays for the product.</p>
<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>Maybe you have a software that can be the foundation for a whole ecosystem. Then you have the chance to add commercial products to the universe of your software.</p>
<p>People will buy your products because you’ll tailor them precisely for the software you built in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="paid-certifications">Paid certifications</h2>
<p>If companies are looking for developers with knowledge of your software, you can certify developers’ abilities. But if you already reached that level of popularity, you probably don’t need that post here anyway.</p>
<p>That said, we’ll hope that your open source project gains popularity and the list of things you can do somehow helps you make the maintenance and development sustainable.</p>
<p>Let’s face it—nobody profits from abandoned open source projects.</p>
<p>That should give you a rough idea of what directions you could take.

October 20, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If programmers were just more disciplined, more <em>professional</em>, they’d write better software. All they need is a <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Coder-The-A-Code-of-Conduct-for-Professional-Programmers/PGM8366.html">code of conduct</a> telling them how to work like those of us who’ve worked it out.</p>
<p>The above statement is true, which is a good thing for those of us interested in improving the state of software and in helping our fellow professionals to improve their craft. However, it’s also very difficult and inefficient to apply, in addition to being entirely unnecessary. In the common parlance of our industry, “discipline doesn’t scale”.</p>
<p>Consider the trajectory of object lifecycle management in the Objective-C programming language, particularly the NeXT dialect. Between 1989 and 1995, the dominant way to deal with the lifecycle of objects was to use the <tt>+new</tt> and <tt>-free</tt> methods, which work much like <tt>malloc/free</tt> in C or <tt>new/delete</tt> in C++. Of course it’s <em>possible</em> to design a complex object graph using this ownership model, it just needs discipline, that’s all. Learn the heuristics that the experts use, and the techniques to ensure correctness, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So around 1994 people introduced new tools to do it an easier way: reference counting. With NeXTSTEP Mach Kit’s <tt>NXReference</tt> protocol and OpenStep’s <tt>NSObject</tt>, developers no longer need to know when <em>everybody</em> in an app is done with an object to destroy it. They can indicate when a reference is taken and when it’s relinquished, and the object itself will see when it’s no longer used and free itself. Learn the heuristics and techniques around auto releasing and unretained references, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So a couple of other tools were introduced, so close together that they were probably developed in parallel[*]: Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection (2006) and Automatic Reference Counting (2008). ARC “won” in popular adoption so let’s focus there: developers no longer need to know exactly when to retain, release, or autorelease objects. Instead of describing the edges of the relationships, they describe the <em>meanings</em> of the relationships and the compiler will automatically take care of ownership tracking. Learn the heuristics and techniques around weak references and the “weak self” dance, and get it correct.</p>
<p>[*] I’m ignoring here the significantly earlier integration of the Boehm conservative GC with Objective-C, because so did everybody else. That in itself is an important part of the technology adoption story.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? You get the idea. You see similar things happen in other contexts: for example C++’s move from <tt>new/delete</tt> to smart pointers follows a similar trajectory over a similar time. The reliance on an entire programming community getting some difficult rules right, when faced with the alternative of using different technology <em>on the same computer</em> that follows the rules for you, is a tough sell.</p>
<p>It seems so simple: computers exist to automate repetitive information-processing tasks. Requiring programmers who have access to computers to recall and follow repetitive information processes is wasteful, when the computer can do that. So give those tasks to the computers.</p>
<p>And yet, for some people the problem with software isn’t a lack of automation but a lack of discipline. Software would be better if only people knew the rules, honoured them, and slowed themselves down so that instead of cutting corners they just chose to ignore important business milestones instead. Back in my day, everybody knew “no Markdown around town” and “don’t code in an IDE after Labour Day”, but now the kids do whatever they want. The motivations seem different, and I’d like to sort them out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with hazing. A lot of the software industry suffers from “I had to go through this, you should too”. Look at software engineering interviews, for example. I’m not sure whether anybody actually believes “I had to deal with carefully ensuring NUL-termination to avoid buffer overrun errors so you should too”, but I do occasionally still hear people telling less-experienced developers that they should learn C to learn more about how their computer works. <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479">Your computer is not a fast PDP-11</a>, all you will learn is how the C virtual machine works.</p>
<p>Just as Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche, so <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/927/real-programmers-don-t-use-pascal">real programmers don’t use Pascal</a>. Real Programmers use FORTRAN. This motivation for sorting discipline from rabble is based on the idea that if it isn’t at least as hard as it was when <em>I</em> did this, it isn’t hard enough. And that means that the goalposts are movable, based on the orator’s experience.</p>
<p>This is often related to the <em>term</em> of their experience: you don’t need TypeScript to write good React Native code, just Javascript and some discipline. You don’t need React Native to write good front-end code, just JQuery and some discipline. You don’t need JQuery…</p>
<p>But along with the term of experience goes the breadth. You see, the person who learned reference counting in 1995 and thinks that you can only <em>really</em> understand programming if you manually type out your own reference-changing events, presumably didn’t go on to use garbage collection in Java in 1996. The person who thinks you can only <em>really</em> write correct software if every case is accompanied by a unit test presumably didn’t learn Eiffel. The person who thinks that you can only <em>really</em> design systems if you use the Haskell type system may not have tried OCaml. And so on.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that for this variety of disciplinarian, the appropriate character and quantity of discipline is whatever they had to deal with at some specific point in their career. Probably a high point: after they’d got over the tricky bits and got productive, and after you kids came along and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason for suggesting the disciplined approach is entomological in nature, as in the case of the eusocial insect the “performant” which, while not a real word, exists in greater quantities in older software than in newer software, apparently. The performant is capable of making software faster, or use less memory, or more concurrent, or less dependent on I/O: the specific characteristics of the performant depend heavily on context.</p>
<p>The performant is often not talked about in the same sentences as its usual companion species, the irrelevant. Yes, there may be opportunities to shave a few percent off the runtime of that algorithm by switching from the automatic tool to the manual, disciplined approach, but does that matter (yet, or at all)? There are software-construction domains where specific performance characteristics are desirable, indeed that’s true across a lot of software. But it’s typical to focus performance-enhancing techniques on the bits where they enhance performance that needs enhancing, not to adopt them across the whole system on the basis that it was better when everyone worked this way. You might save a few hundred cycles writing native software instead of using a VM for that UI method, but if it’s going to run after a network request completes over EDGE then trigger a 1/3s animation, nobody will notice the improvement.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the source, the problem with calls for discipline is that there’s no strong motivation to <em>become</em> more disciplined. I can use these tools, and my customer is this much satisfied, and my employer pays me this much. Or I can learn from you how I’m <em>supposed</em> to be doing it, which will slow me down, for…your satisfaction? So you know I’m doing it the way it’s supposed to be done? Or so that I can tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong, too? Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Therefore discipline doesn’t scale. Whenever you ask some people to slow down and think harder about what they’re doing, some fraction of them will. Some will wonder whether there’s some other way to get what you’re peddling, and may find it. Some more will not pay any attention. The dangerous ones are the ones who thought they <em>were</em> paying attention and yet still end up not doing the disciplined thing you asked for: they either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming). And still more people, by far the vast majority, just weren’t listening at all, and you’ll never reach them.</p>
<p>Let’s flip this around. Let’s look at where we <em>need</em> to be disciplined, and ask if there are gaps in the tool support for software engineers. Some people want us to always write a failing test and make it pass before adding any code (or want us to write a passing test and revert our changes if it accidentally fails): does that mean our tools should not let us write code for which there’s no test? Does the same apply for acceptance tests? Some want us to refactor mercilessly; does that mean our design tools should always propose more parsimonious alternatives for passing the same tests? Some say we should get into the discipline of writing code that always reveals its intent: should the tools make a crack at interpreting the intention of the code-as-prose?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy">Privacy on the Internet</a> is important because privacy risks range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults). Many companies, such as Google, track which websites people visit and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Sometimes prices on products are changed on the same website, depending on tracking information, and two people may view the exact same product on the exact same website yet be presented with very different prices.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article isn't specifically about privacy issues only, it's about promises that are being broken, which might be about privacy. It is also about the lack of user freedom, as in the choice to enable or disable features, such as automatic updates, or forced usage of third party services, or software that the user generally is unaware of or don't have a say about.</p>

<p>Privacy as a subject regarding the usage of services on the Internet is a very difficult subject to deal with. Not only can it be difficult to actually define privacy, but it also requires a balance between freedom of choice by the users, security and usability. Naturally you need to be able to use the browser on the Internet and as such you will always leave some kind of trail behind, and this article is not about how you can hide your tracks. What I am addressing in this article are browsers that are either promoted as "privacy respecting" by the developers, or in general are considered to be so (mostly due to misunderstanding or misinformation), while it is very clear they are not.</p>

<p>Some browsers either directly violate users by collecting telemetric data without consent, or you have to opt-out rather than opt-in, or they bounce around the Internet visiting places in the background without you knowing (using dns-prefetch or automatic updates etc.), using third party services that operates with a privacy policy you either cannot trust, or that are directly violating your privacy, or they have integrated third party software that do some of these things.</p>

<p>I will try to keep this article updated with relevant information as much as possible. I know several other browsers exist, but if they are not mentioned on this list I have either not had a change to investigate them, they are closed source and completely irrelevant (such as Microsoft Edge or Opera), or they are not actively maintained, or they are perhaps a "one mans show" which cannot be trusted for some reason or another.</p>

<p>I will also <strong>not</strong> be looking at browsers that only work on Microsoft Windows or macOS, even if they are Open Source. Both Microsoft Windows and macOS are highly controversial and completely untrustworthy operating systems.</p>

<p>Also please note that just because the developers of a browser are promising that their browser is privacy respecting doesn't mean that you can trust the information. As you will see with the examples of some of the browsers below even developers some times compromise user privacy perhaps without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>I also want to make a strong advice to people recommending browsers to other people without investigation or knowledge. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy related channel on Reddit</a> is filled with wrong recommendations regarding privacy respecting browsers and many people are merely guessing or blindly trusting the information the browser producers are publishing. Neither Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Chromium, Brave, Waterfox, or several of the other recommended browsers truly respect privacy. They all do some form of telemetry and/or privacy compromising actions without the user consenting to it or even knowing about it.</p>

<p>Also, privacy doesn't mean that you simply pull out telemetry from Firefox, rebrand it, and then ship it. Privacy is more than that. Unless the browser is automatically checking for an updated version, and the website isn't logging that request, it cannot be considered truly private if the browser starts bouncing around on the Internet visiting all kinds of places without the user has done anything more than open the browser up! Every time the browser makes a DNS request, that DNS request is in most cases logged unless the user actively does something to mitigate that - such as using a trusted VPN or non-logging DNS service etc. Furthermore, the Mozilla add-on CDN is logging user activity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, so if the browser visits these places without the user explicitly pushes a "check for updates" option, the browser is compromising user privacy. The point I'm trying to make is that the user needs to have the choice and that nothing happens until the user actively do something.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, if you discover any mistakes on my part, feel free to email me about it so that I can correct the information.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-clones">Third party clones</h2>
<p>Several third party clones of Firefox and Chromium exist that are branded and promoted as secure and privacy respecting alternatives that cannot fully be trusted for some reason or another. The code base for both Firefox and Chromium are huge and many skillful people work on the code every day. Having a "one mans show" or a small team of developers diverted browser clone running on your computer that are days, weeks or even months behind security updates does not improve neither your privacy nor your security in any way.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-compromising">Privacy compromising browsers</h2>

<h3 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>In the past I have always supported Mozilla and promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, but Mozilla has made some pretty controversial decisions as of late and I no longer feel that Mozilla is an organization that deserves any support.</p>
<p>Firefox is promoted by Mozilla as a privacy respecting browser, but this is highly misleading. Firefox "phones home" every time you start it up even when you have disabled telemetry and automatic updates of extensions. Domains such as mozilla.org, cloudfront.net, firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (see: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12</a>), autopush.prod.mozaws.net, detectportal.firefox.com and location.services.mozilla.com are visited each time you start Firefox.</p>
<p>In 2017 Mozilla made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqz#Integration_with_Firefox">deal with Cliqz</a> where approximately 1% of users downloading Firefox in Germany would receive a version with Cliqz software included. And in 2018 Mozilla revealed that they had no data on the number of Firefox installations with disabled Telemetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we need better insight into our opt-out rates for telemetry. We use telemetry to ensure new features improve your user experience and to guide Mozilla's business decisions. However, an unknown portion of our users do not report telemetry for a variety of reasons. This means we may not have data that is representative of our entire population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mozilla then developed the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578">Telemetry Coverage</a> system and distributed it to 1% of the Firefox installations. The system is automatically installed and designed to inform Mozilla whether telemetry is enabled in the browser.</p>
<p>Mozilla also <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/telemetry-collection-windows-default-browser-trend">developed a Windows-only scheduled task</a> which runs in the background once a day for each installation of Firefox installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows. The task collects information related to the system's current and previous default browser setting and the operating system locale and version.</p>
<p>This is a list of some of the things that Mozilla collects: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/">Mozilla website</a> we can read (when I originally started writing this article) that <q>We put people over profit</q>, and <q>a product to support user privacy</q>. We can also read in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla manifesto</a>, in the fourth principle, that <q>Individuals' security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</q> However, with their decision to make Cloudflare the default DNS provider for DNS over HTTPS, they are definitely not supporting user privacy or putting people over profit!</p>
<p>DNS over HTTPS is by itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTdEEuyxHU">bad enough</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#Criticism">highly criticized</a> with good reason, but combining it with a US based company like Cloudflare makes it even worse.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has made an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/">agreement</a> with Mozilla that when it acts as a DNS resolver for Firefox, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS requests will be stored as part of Cloudflare's "temporary" logs which are permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cloudflare will also collect and store the following information as part of its permanent logs:
<ul>
<li>Total number of requests processed by each Cloudflare co-location facility.</li>
<li>Aggregate list of all domain names requested.</li>
<li>Samples of domain names queried along with the times of such queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information stored in Cloudflare's permanent logs will be anonymized and may be held indefinitely by Cloudflare for its own internal research and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has worked with DNS servers knows what goes into such logs and in order for Cloudflare to keep their promise they need to: Delete the DNS requests information, but at the same time somehow still keep "anonymized" logs of the total number of requests, a list of all domain names requested, a so-called "sample" of complete DNS queries along with date and time.</p>
<p>This means that even if Cloudflare could be trusted and they have the best of intentions, they will still log everything the first 24 hours. If Cloudflare is ever compromised all these logs could be copied and distributed over a period of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the actual wording of the …</p></article></div>

    <p>The compact disc—the CD—was co-developed by Philips and Sony back in the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:updates-cd"><a href="#fn:updates-cd" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This format was initially developed to store and play music but was then adapted to what we know as the CD-ROM to store data as well, and other formats followed that allowed us to read and write different kinds of data.</p>
<p>In 1995, Microsoft shipped Windows 95 as a CD-ROM and also as a pack of 13 or 26 floppy disks for compatibility with older computers that didn't have a compact disc reader. The entire Windows 95 operating system was only around 22 to 24 megabytes. (More than four times smaller than Instagram for iPhone!)</p>
<p>Priced at dozens or hundreds of dollars, software used to come packed in a huge box. The lucky software, the one that could afford the development costs, would update every couple of years. Windows 95, for instance, released a few updates and patches in 1996 and 1997, while Windows 98 was cooking.</p>
<p>The transaction happened at a physical store where we were buying something tangible: a program packed in a box.</p>
<p>The Office Suite—Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—was bought in a box and installed in your machine with a CD. Every time you formatted your computer or bought a new one, you would come back to those CDs and re-install the software. Office 2003. 2009. 2013. These updates demarcated the appearance of file formats and new functionality that wouldn't work in older versions.</p>
<p>Today you buy a phone with a set of preinstalled apps and, right at your fingertips, you have an app store. With a payment method, you can make a transaction with a finger tap, your fingerprint, or a scan of your face. The app starts installing right away. Maybe free, maybe a couple of dollars. This world is cheaper but gets more and more expensive as we transition into a subscription model. And stores are not only on your phone but on your tablet, laptop, browser, and even on your photo camera or game console.</p>
<p>We get notified of new versions of the apps we use daily. And there's a culture of constant improvement in which applications like Dropbox, Spotify, or Uber release a new version weekly or bi-weekly to keep up-to-date.</p>
<p>At any stage, software bugs can be introduced, existing ones fixed, and new functionality added. We used to have a program that would continue to work the same way for years. But we now have what's called <em>liquid software</em>. Ever-changing code and hundreds of version numbers. (Dropbox is up to version 107.4.443 as I write these lines!)</p>
<p>We're in an era of constant updates, and there's no way back. If there's a bug today, we expect a fix tomorrow. A patch, an update. The problem comes when we can't say no and need to keep programs up-to-date to run on the latest operating systems that would otherwise stop functioning.</p>
<p>Software rots.</p>
<p>In the mobile world, there's a chance that you never upgrade and use a fixed set of functionality. But the web is different. When you load a website, it might have been re-deployed. A new version, updated seconds ago, runs in your browser. The red button you used yesterday to send an email might have changed its place, color, or shape overnight. A piece of functionality you liked (or the annoying bug you had yesterday) might suddenly go away.</p>
<p>An alternative might be to use custom systems or systems with slower update cycles in which backward compatibility is a priority.</p>
<p>Yet it's unlikely we'll ever go back to the once-a-year update, the diskette, or the CD.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>While HTTP/3 specification is still in the draft stage, the latest version of the Chrome browser already <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">supports it by default</a>
. With Chrome holding around 70% of browser market share, you could say HTTP/3 has gone mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/quic-logo.png" alt="QUIC logo"></p><p>The new revision of this foundational protocol aims to make the web more efficient, secure, and shorten the content-delivery latencies. In some ways, it’s a braver take of HTTP2: similar goals addressed by replacing the underlying TCP protocol with a new, purpose-built protocol QUIC. The best way to explain the benefits of QUIC is to illustrate where TCP falls short as a transport for HTTP requests. And to do that, we’ll start at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="http-the-original">HTTP. The Original.</h3><p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee formalized the design of a simple <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line hyper-text-exchange protocol</a>
in 1991, TCP was already an old, reliable protocol. The original definition document of what later became known as HTTP 0.9 specifically mentions TCP as a preferred, albeit not exclusive, transport protocol:</p><blockquote><p>Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP, but could run over any connection-oriented service.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this proof-of-concept version of HTTP had very few similarities to HTTP we now know and love today. There were no headers and no status codes. The typical request was as simple as <code>GET /path</code>. The response contained only HTML and ended with the closing of the TCP connection.
Since browsers were not yet a thing, user was supposed to read HTML directly. It was possible to link to other resources, but none of the tags present in this early version of HTML requested additional resources asynchronously. A single HTTP request delivered a complete, self-sufficient page.</p><h3 id="emergence-of-http10">Emergence of HTTP/1.0</h3><p>In subsequent years the internet has exploded, and HTTP evolved to be an extendable and flexible general-purpose protocol, although transporting HTML remained its chief specialty. There are three critical updates to HTTP that enabled this evolution:</p><ul><li>introduction of methods allowed the client to identify the type of action it wants to perform. For example, POST was created to allow client sending data to the server to process and store</li><li>status codes provided a way for client to confirm that the server has processed the request successfully, and if not - to understand what kind of error has occured</li><li>headers added an ability to attach structured textual metadata to requests and responses that could modify the behavior of the client or server. Encoding and content-type headers, for example, allowed HTTP to transfer not just HTML, but any type of payload. “Compression” header allowed the client and server to negotiate supported compression formats, thus reducing the amount of data to transfer over the connection</li></ul><p>At the same time, HTML advanced to support images, styles, and other linked resources. Browsers were now forced to perfrom multiple requests to display a single web page, which the original connection-per-request architecture was not designed to handle. Establishing and ending a TCP connection involves a lot of back-and-forth packet exchange, so it is relatively expensive in terms of latency overhead. It didn’t matter much when a web-page consisted of a single text file, but as the number of requests per page increased, so did the latency.</p><p>The picture below illustrates how much overhead was involved in establishing a new TCP connection per request.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-tcp-overhead.png" alt="TCP connection requires three requests to establish connection and four to close it cleanly"></p><p>A “connection” header was created to address this problem. Client sends a request with “connection: keep-alive” header to signal intent to keep the TCP connection open for subsequent requests. If server understands this header and agrees to respect it, its response will also contain the “connection: keep-alive” header. This way, both parties maintain TCP channel open and use it for subsequent communication until either party decides to close it. This became even more important with the spread of SSL/TLS encryption, because negotianting an encryption algorithm and exchanging cryptographic keys requires an additional request/response cycle on each connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-keepalive.png" alt="A single TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests with “connection: keep-alive” header"></p><p>At the time, many of the HTTP improvements appeared spontaneously. When a popular browser or a server app saw a need for a new HTTP feature, they would simply implement it themselves and hoped that other parties would follow the suit. Ironically, a decentralized web needed a centralized governing body to avoid fragmentation into incompatible pieces. Tim Berners-Lee, the original creator of the protocol, recognized the danger and founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which together with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) worked on formalizing stack of internet technologies. As the initial step to bring more structure to the existing environment, they documented the most common features used in HTTP at the time and named the resulting protocol HTTP/1.0. However, because this “specification” described varied, often inconsistent techniques as seen “in the wild”, it never received a status of a standard. Instead, the work on the new version of the HTTP protocol has begun.</p><h3 id="standardization-of-http11">Standardization of HTTP/1.1</h3><p>HTTP/1.1 fixed inconsistencies of HTTP/1.0 and adjusted the protocol to be more performant in the new web ecosystem. Two of the most critical changes introduced were the use of persistent TCP connections (keep-alive’s) by default and HTTP pipelining.</p><p>HTTP pipelining simply means that client does not need to wait for the server to respond to a request before sending subsequent HTTP requests. This feature resulted in even more efficient use of bandwidth and reduced latencies, but it could be improved even more. HTTP pipelining still requires from server to respond in the order of requests received, so if a single request in a pipeline is slow to fulfill, all subsequent responses to a client will be delayed accordingly. This problem is known as head-of-the-line blocking.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http11-blocking.png" alt="Since large-picture.jpg was requested first, it’s blocking the delivery of the style.css"></p><p>At this point in time, the web is gaining more and more interactive capabilities. Web 2.0 is just around the corner, some webpages include dozens or even hundreds of external resources. To work around the head-of-the-line blocking, and to decrease page loading speeds, clients establish multiple TCP connections per host. Of course, the connection overhead never went anywhere. In reality, it got worse, since more and more applications encrypt HTTP traffic with SSL/TLS. So most browsers set the limit of maximal possible simultaneous connections in an attempt to strike a delicate balance.</p><p>Many of the larger web-services have recognized that existing limitations are too restricting for their exceptionally heavy interactive web-applications, so they “gamed the system” by distributing their app through multiple domain names. It all worked, somehow, but the solution has been far from elegant.</p><p>Despite a few shortcomings, the simplicity of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 has made them widely successful, and for over a decade no one has made a serious attempt to change them.</p><h3 id="spdy-and-http2">SPDY and HTTP/2</h3><p>In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser, which rapidly gained popularity for being quick and innovative. It has given Google a strong vote on matters of internet technologies. In the early 2010s, Google adds support for its web protocol SPDY to Chrome.</p><p>HTTP/2 standard was based on SPDY with some improvements. HTTP/2 solved the head-of-the-line blocking problem by multiplexing the HTTP requests over a single open TCP connection. This allowed server to answer requests in any order, client could then re-assemble the responses as it received them, making the whole exchange faster within a single connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http2-multiplexing.png" alt="style.css was returned before the large-picture.jpg, becuase of HTTP/2 multiplexing"></p><p>In fact, with HTTP/2 server can serve the resources to a client before it even asked for it! To give an example, if the server knows that client will most likely need a stylesheet to display an HTML page, it can “push” the CSS to the client without waiting for a corresponding request. While beneficial in theory, this feature rarely seen in practice, since it requires a server to understand the structure of the HTML it serves, which is rarely the case.</p><p>HTTP/2 also allows compressing request headers in addition to the request body, which further reduces the amount of data transferred over the wire.</p><p>HTTP/2 solved a lot of problems for the web, but not all of them. A similar type of head-of-the-line problem is still present on the level of TCP protocol, which remains a foundational building block of the web. When a TCP packet gets lost in transit, the receiver can’t acknowledge incoming packages until the lost package is re-sent by a server. Since TCP is by design oblivious to higher-level protocols like HTTP, a single lost packet will block the stream for all in-flight HTTP requests until the missing data is re-sent. This problem is especially prominent on an unreliable connection, which is not rare in the age of ubiquitous mobile devices.</p><h3 id="http3-revolution">HTTP/3 revolution</h3><p>Since issues with HTTP/2 can not be resolved purely on the application layer a new iteration of the protocol must update the transport layer. However, creating a new transport-layer protocol is not an easy task. Transport protocols need to be supported by hardware vendors and deployed by the majority of network operators, which are reluctant to update because of the costs and efforts involved. Take IPv6 as an example: it was introduced 24 years ago and is still far from being universally supported.</p><p>Fortunately, there is another option. UDP protocol is as widely supported as TCP but is simple enough to serve as a building block for custom protocols running on top of it. UDP packets are fire-and-forget: there are no handshakes, persistent connections, or error-correction. The primary idea behind HTTP3 is to abandon TCP in favor of a UDP-based QUIC protocol. QUIC adds the necessary features (those that were previously provided by TCP, and more) in a way that makes sense for the web environment.</p><p>Unlike HTTP2, which technically allowed an unencrypted communication, QUIC strictly requires encryption to establish a connection. Additionally, encryption is applied to all data …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<h2><span>Adolphe Sax, a Dinantais of genius</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Along with Joachim Patenier (1485-1524), the creator of landscape painting; with Antoine Wiertz (1806-1865), the lyrical painter; with a plethora of sculptors, painters, musicians, brassworkers and others, Dinant can legitimately pride itself on having been the birthplace on 6 November 1814 of Antoine-Joseph, or Adolphe, Sax, a prolific and inspired inventor in the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
<p>In 1860, the diarist, Oscar Comettant, wrote, "In the services that he has rendered to musical art, in the battles he has had to go through to bring his discoveries to the light of day and defend them from despoilment and in the rewards he has been the object of from all the industrial nations, [Sax's life] rises to the heights of a social event. Novelists will draw from this strange life mysterious and moving episodes (we would add: the legal world will find in the account of the "Sax trial" a vast domain for a case law study) and the moralists will find in it the features of self-denial, physical courage and perseverance, of which only a lifted soul and a great heart are capable.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Enfance"></a>
<h2><span>An Agitated Childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Antoine-Joseph Sax was born in the street that has borne his name since 1896, in a modest house, which was destroyed in 1914, and which was built on the present site of an important commercial building.</p>
<p>In its façade, there is a stained-glass window and an inscription chiselled into the stonework: "Adolphe Sax, 1814-1894, was born here". This window was solemnly inaugurated on 27 June 1954, on the initiative of the Tourist Information Centre, under the mayorship of Mr Léon Sasserath. It is the work of Mr Jean Jadin, who designed the cartoon, and Miss Maggy Arzée. Both were taught by Miss Yvonne Gérard and Mr Perot, teachers of graphic art and decoration at the Fine Arts Academy in Namur, which was then directed by Mr Lambeau. It was created under the direction of Mr Van de Capelle.</p>
<p>Son of Charles-Joseph Sax (1791-1865) and Marie-Joseph Masson (1813-1861), Antoine-Joseph was the eldest of eleven children (six boys and five girls, only four of whom survived, the others dying between the ages of 20 and 25).</p>
<p>His childhood was tragic. Hardly able to stand, Antoine-Joseph fell from a height of three floors, seriously bumping his head against a stone: he was believed dead. At the age of three, he swallowed a bowl of vitriolized water, and then a pin. Later, he was seriously burned in a gunpowder explosion; he fell onto a cast iron frying pan and burned himself on one side. Three times he escaped poisoning and asphyxiation in his bedroom, where varnished items were lying about during the night. Another time, he was hit on the head by a cobblestone; he fell into a river and was saved by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>"<em>He's a child condemned to misfortune; he won't live," his mother said. In the district, they called him "little Sax, the ghost</em>".</p>
<p>These initial serious incidents were, alas, but the prelude to an eventful existence such as only a few have known. In 1858, Adolphe Sax was miraculously saved from a cancer of the lip by a black doctor who knew the properties of certain Indian plants. What would the future have been but for this intervention?</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Charles-Joseph"></a>
<h2><span>Charles-Joseph Sax</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A joiner-cabinetmaker, Charles-Joseph Sax quickly launched himself, with success, into the manufacture of musical instruments. In the "New Street" he ran a large workshop. In this trade, he acquired such a reputation that, in 1815 (his eldest son was only one year old), he also set up a workshop in Brussels (where Antoine-Joseph's brothers and sisters were to be born), where he was summoned by William I of Orange (we were then under Dutch occupation). The latter appointed him as maker to the Court and entrusted him with the task of supplying suitable instruments to Belgium regimental music corps.</p>
<p>A self-taught man, therefore, Charles-Joseph Sax made woodwind and brass instruments, even violins and pianos. He registered a dozen patents and brought his instruments to perfection. He successfully participated in numerous exhibitions, where he was awarded flattering distinctions.</p>
<p>At the time when he could have spend the day playing, laughing and having fun, Antoine-Joseph observed the work in his father's workshop, besides being given instruction by one of his uncles, a teacher in Dinant. He was intelligent and his inventive mind was already showing itself, thanks to his love for music (whilst very young, he took singing and flute lessons). Thereafter, he was given lessons by his father, who quickly appreciated his abilities and did all he could to develop them.</p>
<p>Far from disregarding his son's aspirations, Charles-Joseph Sax made him his apprentice and, from a young age, he was conscious of the importance of his work, as though he were anticipating his destiny.</p>
<p>In 1853, after the death of seven of his eleven children, and following financial worries at his Brussels business, Charles-Joseph joined his son in Paris. The master was to become the servant, and was from then on in charge of making saxophones until his death in 1865.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Jeunesse"></a>
<h2><span>A productive childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Supported and assisted by his father, the youth worked. He created, he perfected instruments and he played them. He was 16 when he went to the Industrial Exposition in Brussels to present flutes and ivory clarinets. At the age of 20, he made an entirely new clarinet, with 24 keys, a work of imagination and a masterpiece of manual work. Then, a new bass clarinet, which incited enthusiasm in Habeneck, the leader of the orchestra at the Paris Opera House, who was passing through Brussels, and who called the other clarinets "barbarian instruments".</p>
<p>Even at that early stage, this creation provoked jealousy in the soloist at the "Great Royal Harmony" in Brussels, who refused to use it because, he said, it had come from "that weedy little pupil, Sax". "Play your clarinet, then" Sax answered, " and I shall play mine." The challenge accepted, Sax triumphed in front of four thousand people. He became a soloist. Works were written for him that, after his departure, were no longer played because they were so difficult!</p>
<p>The young genius pursued his work. He invented a sound reflector, a new double-bass clarinet, a piano-tuning process that remained the inventor's secret and who probably was unable to exploit it for want of money, a steam organ "capable of being heard throughout the province": now that just shows Sax's tendency to think big!</p>
<p>Sax's beginnings throw a very curious light on his character (we shall call him Adolphe from now on): energy, courage, dynamism, total self-confidence. He refused to go and set up a business in St Petersburg, rejected an offer to set up in London. That means that his reputation exceeded frontiers. Sax was conscious of all his possibilities and his talent; he conceived the work that he felt the call to achieve; he was full of hope and he believed he had every chance of success; he had great visions, he believed in what he saw. He suffocated in his little country.</p>
<p>In 1840, he presented nine inventions at the Belgian Exhibition. He was denied the first medal on the plea of his young age; there would be nothing left to offer him the year after. He was thwarted in his true-love, if not in his pride. He refused the vermeil medal he was awarded, replying with pride, "<em>If they think me too young to deserve the gold medal, I myself think me too old to accept this vermeil one</em>."</p>

<p>Europe's centre of attraction, Paris haunted him, Paris called him.</p>
<p>The composer Halévy wrote to him of the hope that composers had in his inventions: "<em>Hurry and finish your new family of instruments (saxophones) and come and succour to the poor composers that are looking for something new and to the public that is demanding it, if not to the world itself.</em>"</p>
<p>Let us add to this call and the snub in Brussels the fact of his family trials, and the decision was made: Adolphe Sax left for Paris "rich in ideas and light in cash": he had thirty francs in his pocket!</p>
<p>The year 1842 formed the turning point in Sax's life, possessing as he did his new invention: the saxophone and its family.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dinant.be/uploads/pages/286/sax_atel.jpg" alt="">Moreover, in 1841, had he not presented it anonymously in Brussels, behind a curtain, so as not to disclose it and avoid the risk of plagiarism?</p>
<p>Adolphe Sax was almost thirty, "the age at which man's creative character affirms itself, at which the human personality is drawn." At the age of 27, Napoleon won his first battle in Italy; Newton was 24 and Einstein 26 when they devised their theories. Mozart died aged 35 and Schubert at 31. Examples of precocious geniuses are manifold.</p>
<p>As one former inhabitant of Dinant once rightfully said (1) "<em>a distinction has to be drawn here between a man who draws from his own abstract thoughts the stuff that his genius will knead, him for whom symbols and signs are sufficient to bring forth a thought laden with restrained life and latent splendours; and the other man for whom a technique, slow and tenacious apprenticeship on a complicated apparatus is necessary for him to be able to physically achieve the formal idea. Count, for example, how many early-developing mathematicians there are compared with child physicists. The former exist, the latter are nowhere to be found. Sax is of the category of intellectuals that concentrated on matter and not pure form"</em>.</p>
<p>In 1842, there was Adolphe Sax living in a simple shed in Rue Saint-Georges, Paris. To set up business, he had to borrow money from a musician acquaintance.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><span>Thanks to Berlioz</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><span><strong>About the saxophone, he said "<em>Its principal merit in my view is the varied beauty of its accent, sometimes serious, sometimes calm, sometimes impassioned, dreamy or melancholic, or vague, like the weakened echo of an echo, like the indistinct plaintiff moans of the breeze in the woods and, even better, like the mysterious vibrations of a bell, long after it has been struck; there does not exist another musical instrument …</em></strong></span></p></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<p>For an improved experience you can use <code>rlwrap nc</code> instead to don't have incoming messages mess up your input</p>
<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/my-chatbot-is-dead-%C2%B7-why-yours-should-probably-be-too/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/my-chatbot-is-dead-%C2%B7-why-yours-should-probably-be-too/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                
<audio controls="controls"><source src="https://azumbrunnen.me/audio/chatbot-is-dead" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>



<p>Personal websites are usually like old books in a shelf. They languish, accumulate dust, and their wrinkles and cracks become more apparent over time. About 3 years ago I embarked on a simple experiment that would end up prolonging the shelf-life of my website by an unusually large margin.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, it seemed like Conversational UI was poised to take over the world. We saw Quartz turning news into a conversation, WeChat being featured as the poster-child of a post application world, iMessage turning into an unnecessarily complex mess, and chatbots popping up like mushrooms in moist forests.</p>



<p>Of course, any trend gaining so much traction and interest needs to be taken seriously. As such, I decided to familiarize myself with the topic, and turned my website into a chatbot.</p>



<p>Instead of being greeted by the internationally standardized greeting every designer used at some point in their career, there was no bold, dramatically oversized, and deep black sans-serif reading: <em>Hi, I’m a designer.</em> (To be fair, I didn’t use Proxima Nova either)</p>



<p>Instead, a couple of chat bubbles exuberantly ushered onto the canvas to greet users as if we had all been long time friends.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-animated.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Conversational intro</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was witty, new, and slightly awkward. People would send messages that ranged from simple chit chat, to deep philosophical topics, to downright disturbing and ridiculous insults.</p>



<p>The experiment got featured on Hackernews, Medium, was used in psychological studies conducted by Dan Ariely’s team, and the source code was ripped and edited by various startups to fit their needs. One business in the Bay Area had an idea to use it to sell flowers in a conversational way. It looks like they went out of business.</p>



<p>The reaction and feedback was surprising to say the least. It was an idea so simple, so silly, that the outcome was in many ways unexpected. After all, the only one who really cares about your website, is usually yourself.</p>



<p>That didn’t stop me from revamping my website and kill the very thing that had turned it into a micro-celebrity before. With the death of my old chatbot, some angry emails by schools who are using it as a reference for “creative” web design, and a good amount of time that has passed ever since, I wanted to take a step back and set the record straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2>When chatbots matter</h2>



<p>So let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment: <em>when did you actually ever enjoy talking to a chat bot?</em> And I’m not talking about the type of bots you talk to when you’re bored, but about those that provide a deeper purpose.</p>



<p>It turns out that the answer is, at least for most of us, almost never.</p>



<p>I love you Intercom, except when I don’t. 99% of time I don’t want to talk to a silly and obtrusive avatar popping up from some corner of the screen before I even had a chance to check out what’s going on. Somehow, I can’t help but think others feel the same.</p>



<p>In fact, we do know that others feel the same. Chat heads jumping at us unasked, are the quintessential equivalent of the infamous sales clerk who eagerly talks to us upon entering a store.</p>



<p>To further add to the challenges: as soon as users go off-script, chat bot’s don’t just become awkward and unpredictable—they turn into little sociopaths that might rub users the wrong way.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="346" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png" alt="" srcset="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png 400w, https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>UX Chat.me —&nbsp;Conversational UX News</figcaption></figure>



<p>The moment you create a chat bot is the moment you allow customers to have a conversation with <em>your brand</em>. Not with yourself, not with your friend, but with an uber entity—a symbol—that represents everything you and your team stand for. That’s not a step to be taken lightly.</p>



<p>This simple conversational entity can be a fun tool to engage with people but depending on how the conversation goes, it can quickly turn into a misrepresentation of the values of your team and your company. So building a chat bot should never be the default choice, but an intentional one.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth asking yourself the following three questions before venturing into this space:</p>



<h3>1. Is your use case simple enough to be solved through chat?</h3>



<p>Conversation is incredibly complex and it’s challenging enough to keep it on track in the real world. If the use case isn’t simple, chances are, chat bots are not the right tool for the job.</p>



<h3>2. Is your NLP capable and sophisticated enough?</h3>



<p>There are two types of bots: pre-scripted bots with a range of default answers users can choose from, and Natural Language Processing based ones.</p>



<p>Choosing the right one is hard. While pre-scripted can feel too limiting, NLP can break at every corner. Often times, teams quickly fall into the trap of spending a huge amount of time focusing on personality and silly jokes, instead of solving the problem users hired you for in the first place.</p>



<p>Therefore, building on top of the first point above, within the conversational landscape, simple always wins.</p>



<h3>3. Are your users actually in chat based environments?</h3>



<p>Chat bots work best where users already are. If your users are primarily spending time in messaging platforms where bots and micro-apps can be seamlessly embedded, great. That can serve as an effective and natural way to engage with your audience because it matches the “be where users already are” principle.</p>



<p>If on the other hand, people come to your website, a medium that has made great strides to provide content in a non-linear and quick way, it often unnecessarily slows users down. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Farewell chatbot</h2>



<p>I don’t want to discredit chat bots as a paradigm. They have their use in certain industries, medium, and work well for a specific set of use cases. The important part is being deliberate, rather than jumping ship blindfolded.</p>



<p>So whereas turning my website into a chat was a fun experiment, I ultimately feel like it has slowly turned into a fad. I got fooled by the trend, and as a by-product became part of the trend itself.  Fads come and go, and as they get refined and re-interpreted, they ultimately find their true purpose. What we’re left with is the age old insight that it’s only through experimentation, that we can unlock concepts and ideas that last.</p>



<p>Rest in peace chat bot, long live chat bots.</p>

        <p>A survey conducted by u/PM_ME__UR_CANCER</p>
        <p><img src="https://747anon.github.io/blm-survey/img/github.png" width="200px" alt="Github"></p>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.

                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
                options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
                for their responses is as follows:
                </p><p>
                <b>For</b></p></div><ul>
                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <h2>Correlations</h2>
            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.

            <div><p>
                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

                The above holds true when compared to the correlation between countries, and it becomes clear that countries with a

<p><strong>In the first of the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to DRM” series, we define</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>what DRM (Digital Rights Management) is,</strong></li><li><strong>and why it plays an important role in ensuring fair use of digital resources through a combination of encryption, access control technology, and business rules.</strong></li></ul>








<h2><span id="The_Tale_of_Two_Boys"></span>The Tale of Two Boys<span></span></h2>



<p>Ram and Shyam were 7th graders who loved passing notes to each other during class. An inseparable duo, their notes contained the latest school gossip, computer game cheat codes, and cricket match scores.</p>



<p>Their notes used to pass through several of their classmates’ hands in their journey because they sat far away from each other in class. But, the boys weren’t worried about others learning their secrets because they trusted their classmates.</p>



<p>However, one sad day, one of their classmates opened one of their notes and broke their trust!! Delighted by the juicy gossip in the note, he used it to take Ram and Shyam’s lunch money.</p>

<p>Having lost all of his lunch money, Ram thought long and hard about sending his notes securely to Shyam and before long, Ram had an idea.</p>



<p>“How about using a code language to write my notes?”</p>



<p>Excellent idea, he thought to himself and set about creating a substitution code (1 for A, 2 for B, and so on). The following day in class, Ram used his new code language to write a secret message and send it to Shyam.</p>



<p>The note made its way to Shyam through the hands of several curious (&amp; nosy) classmates, and none of them could crack the code.</p>



<p>But, when Shyam got the message, he looked perplexed and thought to himself –</p>



<blockquote><p>What are these numbers, squiggly lines, and alphabets? Is Ram testing his new pen, or was he hit on the head with a cricket ball?</p></blockquote>



<p>Ram stared at Shyam’s puzzled face with equal bewilderment and suddenly realized his mistake. He had forgotten to send Shyam the key to the code!</p>



<p>So, Ram wrote down the code on a piece of paper and sent it to Shyam, who used it to decode the note.</p>



<p>Job well done, Ram thought to himself.</p>



<p>They didn’t know that one of their classmates had copied down the coded message and now had the codebook. For the second day in a row, Ram and Shyam lost their secrets and their lunch money.</p>



<p>They realized that they needed to transmit the code securely each time they used code or changed it.</p>



<p><strong>But how would they do that?</strong></p>



<h2 id="what-did-ram--shyam-do"><span id="What_Did_Ram_Shyam_Do"></span>What Did Ram &amp; Shyam Do?<span></span></h2>



<p><strong><em>Narrator:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>The problem faced by the boys is a classic problem in data transmission. It is easy to use a codebook, create a secret message, and send it to the recipient but, how do you send the codebook to the recipient and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands?</em></p>



<p>Then one night, Shyam had a brainwave. He called Ram and said –</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – suppose we ask Hari to join us in note passing? We’ll ask him to keep the codebook safe in his schoolbag. Each time you or I need to write or read a message, we’ll ask Hari for the codebook. What do you think?</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – that could work! But, will Hari agree to this?</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Yea – I thought of that too. Every time we ask him for the codebook, let’s give him a chocolate.</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Ah – excellent idea!</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;So, the boys decided to bring in their friend Hari into their plans and asked him to be a “trusted” third-party. And, his duties were to –</p>



<ol><li>invent a new code every day to reduce chances of someone cracking it and</li><li>provide the code’s key to only Ram and Shyam in a way that nobody else can open and read it.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And the boys had to give him a bar of chocolate each time they asked for the codebook.</strong></p>



<p>Yummy price to pay for privacy, huh?</p>



<h2 id="digital-rights-management-drm"><span id="Digital_Rights_Management_(DRM)"></span>Digital Rights Management (DRM)<span></span></h2>



<p>In reality, what our creative 7th graders invented was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that not only provided security for their content (notes) but also allowed them to set some rules.</p>



<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a method of protecting your content while having the flexibility to chose who gets to consume it via business rules and a secure, protected communication protocol.</p>



<p>For example, you could set rules to,</p>



<ul><li>block people from certain countries,</li><li>allow access to the content for a certain period,</li><li>prevent a user from casting the movie onto a screen,</li><li>block free users from accessing premium content,</li><li>block playback on specific devices,</li><li>etc.</li></ul>



<p>DRM plays a vital role in reducing piracy and ensuring that content creators can monetize their efforts.</p>



<p>But, remember this –&nbsp;<strong>DRM is not the same as encryption</strong>.</p>



<p>DRM is a system or solution that</p>



<ul><li>uses encryption to protect the content</li><li>uses specialized techniques to <strong>securely store and deliver</strong> the encryption/decryption keys&nbsp;<em>(codebooks in our 7th graders’ example)</em> and use the keys to decrypt the content in a way that it doesn’t get into the wrong hands. </li><li>allows the content publishers to set business rules and control who can consume their content (expiry times, etc.).</li></ul>



<p>We’ll learn more about this in future articles.</p>



<h2 id="back-to-our-7th-graders"><span id="Back_to_Our_7th_Graders"></span>Back to Our 7th Graders<span></span></h2>



<p>Now let’s go back and look at the simple solution that our 7th graders invented, which provided</p>



<ul><li>a high-security level through daily renewal and code rotation.</li><li>authentication and rights management (read, write permissions)</li><li>a well-defined pricing model.</li></ul>



<p>The truly remarkable part about this scheme is that as Ram and Shyam get more popular in school, they can allow a few other classmates to only “read” their messages and not “write” any messages.</p>



<p>All they’d need to do is go to Hari, give him the names and photos of their “newly trusted” friends, and ask Hari to allow them only to read the messages.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>if</strong>&nbsp;the boys’ messages get super-popular, they can ask Hari to</p>



<ul><li>block or allow access to classmates based on where they sit in class:&nbsp;<em>front-benchers not allowed</em>&nbsp;<strong>(geo-blocking)</strong></li><li>Create a set of special notes and charge their classmates two chocolates to read them. All they need to do is tell Hari their subscribers’ names.&nbsp;<strong>(paid usage / subscribers / freemium model)</strong></li><li>deny access to messages that are more than 2 hours old (stale news!)&nbsp;<strong>(expiry date &amp; time of day restriction)</strong></li></ul>



<p>And so on. Amazing, right?</p>



<p>A simple technique to prevent others from reading their messages has now turned into a full-blown business with</p>



<ul><li>heavy-duty encryption and</li><li>business rules that decide access and usage rights.</li></ul>



<h2 id="commercial-drm-solutions"><span id="Commercial_DRM_Solutions"></span>Commercial DRM Solutions<span></span></h2>



<p>Commercially, there are many trusted DRM technologies such as Microsoft’s PlayReady, Google’s Widevine, and Apple’s FairPlay. And there are DRM vendors who provide additional infrastructure around these DRM solutions by adding more business rules, analytics, and tools for publishers.</p>



<p>In future articles, we’ll examine the differences between them and see where they are applicable.</p>



<p>Until then, take care, and see you soon!</p>



<p><strong>Note: DRM is seen as a contentious topic with people on both sides of the fence. This series of articles is a technology-explainer and stays clear of the other debates on DRM.</strong></p>

            <section>
                <p>Today at <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/egsr18/">EGSR 2018</a>, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced the release of two large, production quality/scale data sets for rendering research purposes.
The data sets are available on a new <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/data-sets/">data sets page on the official Disney Animation website</a>.
The first data set is the Cloud Data Set, which contains a large and highly detailed volumetric cloud data set that we used for our “<a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2017/07/spectral-and-decomposition-tracking.html">Spectral and Decomposition Tracking for Rendering Heterogeneous Volumes</a>” SIGGRAPH 2017 paper, and the second data set is the Moana Island Scene, which is a full production scene from <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2016/11/moana.html">Moana</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/shotCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/shotCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 1: The Moana Island Data Set, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share some personal thoughts, observations, and notes.
The release of these data sets was announced by my teammate, Ralf Habel, at EGSR today, but this release has been in the works for a very long time now, and is the product of the collective effort of an enormous number of people across the studio.
A number of people deserve to be highlighted: Rasmus Tamstorf spearheaded the entire effort and was instrumental in getting the resources and legal approval needed for the Moana Island Scene.
Heather Pritchett is the TD that did the actual difficult work of extracting the Moana Island Scene out of Disney Animation’s production pipeline and converting it from proprietary data formats into usable, industry-standard data formats.
Sean Palmer and Jonathan Garcia also helped in resurrecting the data from Moana.
Hyperion developers Ralf Habel and Peter Kutz led the effort to get the Cloud Data Set approved and released; the cloud itself was made by artists Henrik Falt and Alex Nijmeh.
On the management side of things, technology manager Rajesh Sharma and Disney Animation CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/ncannon?lang=en">Nick Cannon</a>, provided crucial support and encouragement.
Matt Pharr has been crucial in collaborating with us to get these data sets released.
Matt was highly accommodating in helping us get the Moana Island Scene into a PBRT scene; I’ll talk a bit more about this later.
Intel’s Embree team also gave significant feedback.
My role was actually quite small; along with other members of the Hyperion development team, I just provided some consultation throughout the whole process.</p>

<p>Please note the licenses that the data sets come with.
The Cloud Data Set is licensed under a <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/6/asset/License_Cloud.pdf">Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>; the actual cloud is based on a photograph by Kevin Udy on his <a href="https://coclouds.com/436/cumulus/%202012-07-26/">Colorado Clouds Blog</a>, which is also licensed under the same Creative Commons license.
The Moana Island Scene is licensed under a more restrictive, custom Disney Enterprises <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/4/asset/License_Moana.pdf">research license</a>.
This is because the Moana Island Scene is a true production scene; it was actually used to produce actual frames in the final film.
As such, the data set is being released only for pure research and development purposes; it’s not meant for use in artistic projects.
Please stick to and follow the licenses these data sets are released under; if people end up misusing these data sets, then it makes releasing more data sets into the community in the future much harder for us.</p>

<p>This entire effort was sparked two years ago at SIGGRAPH 2016, when Matt Pharr made an appeal to the industry to provide representative production-scale data sets to the research community.
I don’t know how many times I’ve had conversations about how well new techniques or papers or technologies will scale to production cases, only to have further discussion stymied by the lack of any true production data sets that the research community can test against.
We decided as a studio to answer Matt’s appeal, and last year at SIGGRAPH 2017, Brent Burley and Rasmus Tamstorf announced our intention to release both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets.
It’s taken nearly a year from announcement to release because the process has been complex, and it was very important to the studio to make sure the release was done properly.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges was getting all of the data out of the production pipeline and our various proprietary data formats into something that the research community can actually parse and make use of.
Matt Pharr was extremely helpful here; over the past year, Matt has added support for <a href="http://ptex.us/">Ptex</a> textures and implemented the <a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2015-shading-course/burley/s2015_pbs_disney_bsdf_notes.pdf">Disney Bsdf</a> in <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3">PBRT v3</a>.
Having Ptex and the Disney Bsdf available in PBRT v3 made PBRT v3 the natural target for an initial port to a renderer other than Hyperion, since internally all of Hyperion’s shading uses the Disney Bsdf, and all of our texturing is done through Ptex.
Our texturing also relies heavily on procedural <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/seexpr.html">SeExpr</a> expressions; all of the expression-drive texturing had to be baked down into Ptex for the final release.</p>

<p>Both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets are, quite frankly, enormous.
The Cloud data set contains a single OpenVDB cloud that weighs in at 2.93 GB; the data set also provides versions of the VDB file scaled down to half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth scale resolutions.
The Moana Island data set comes in three parts: a base package containing raw geometry and texture data, an animation package containing animated stuff, and a PBRT package containing a PBRT scene generated from the base package.
These three packages combined, uncompressed, weigh in at well over 200 GB of disk space; the uncompressed PBRT package along weighs in at around 38 GB.</p>

<p>For the Moana Island Scene, the provided PBRT scene requires a minimum of around 90 GB if RAM to render.
This many seem enormous for consumer machines, because it is.
However, this is also what we mean by “production scale”; for Disney Animation, 90 GB is actually a fairly mid-range memory footprint for a production render.
On a 24-core, dual-socket Intel Xeon Gold 6136 system, the PBRT scene took me a little over an hour and 15 minutes to render from the ‘shotCam’ camera.
Hyperion renders the scene faster, but I would caution against using this data set to do performance shootouts between different renders.
I’m certain that within a short period of time, enthusiastic members of the rendering community will end up porting this scene to Renderman and Arnold and Vray and Cycles and every other production renderer out there, which will be very cool!
But keep in mind, this data set was authored very specifically around Hyperion’s various capabilities and constraints, which naturally will be very different from how one might author a complex data set for other renderers.
Every renderer works a bit differently, so the most optimal way to author a data set for every renderer will be a bit different; this data set is no exception.
So if you want to compare renderers using this data set, make sure you understand the various ways how the way this data set is structured impacts the performance of whatever renderers you are comparing.</p>

<p>For example, Hyperion subdivides/tessellates/displaces everything to as close to sub-poly-per-pixel as it can get while still fitting within computational resources.
This means our scenes are usually very heavily subdivided and tessellated.
However, the PBRT version of the scene doesn’t come with any subdivision; as a result, silhouettes in the following comparison images don’t fully match in some areas.
Similarly, PBRT’s lights and lighting model differ from Hyperion’s, and Hyperion has various artistic controls that are unique to Hyperion, meaning the renders produced by PBRT versus Hyperion differ in many ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/grassCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/grassCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 7a: 'grassCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

The sand dune in the background looks particularly different from the Hyperion render due to subdivision and displacement."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 8a: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 8b: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. The palm leaves look especially different due to differences in artistic lighting shaping and curve shading differences. Most notably, the look in Hyperion depends heavily on attributes that vary along the length of the curve, which is something PBRT doesn't support yet. Some more work is needed here to get the palm leaves to look more similar between the two renders."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 9a: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 9b: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. Again, the significant difference in appearance in the rocks is probably just due to subdivision/tesselation/displacement."></a></p>

<p>Another example of a major difference between the Hyperion renders and the PBRT renders is in the water, which Hyperion renders using photon mapping to get the caustics.
The provided PBRT scenes use unidirectional pathtracing for everything including the water, hence the very different caustics.
Similarly, the palm trees in the ‘palmsCam’ camera angle look very different between PBRT and Hyperion because Hyperion’s lighting controls are very different from PBRT; Hyperion’s lights include various artistic controls for custom shaping and whatnot, which aren’t necessarily fully physical.
Also, the palm leaves are modeled using curves, and the shading depends on varying colors and attributes along the length and width of the curve, which PBRT doesn’t support yet (getting the palm leaves is actually the top priority for if more resources are freed up to improve the data set release).
These difference between renderers don’t necessarily mean that one renderer is better than the other; they simply mean that the renderers are different.
This will be true for any pair of renderers that one wants to compare.</p>

<p>The Cloud Data Set includes an example render from Hyperion, which implements our Spectral and Decomposition Tracking paper in its volumetric rendering system to efficiently render the cloud with thousands of bounces.
This render contains no post-processing; what you see in the provided image is exactly what Hyperion outputs.
The VDB file expresses the cloud as a field of heterogeneous densities.
Also provided is an example <a href="https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba</a> scene, renderable using the <a href="https://github.com/zhoub/mitsuba-vdb">Mitsuba-VDB plugin that can be found on Github</a>.
Please consult the README file for some modifications in Mitsuba that are necessary to render the cloud.
Also, please note that the Mitsuba example will take an extremely long time to render, since Mitsuba isn’t really meant to render high-albedo heterogeneous volumes.
With proper acceleration structures and algorithms, rendering the cloud only takes us a few minutes using Hyperion, and should be similarly fast in any modern production renderer.</p>

<p>One might wonder just why production data sets in general are so large.
This is an interesting question; the short answer across the industry basically boils down to “artist time is more expensive and valuable than computer hardware”.
We could get these scenes to fit into much smaller …</p></section></article></div></div>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="thumbnails ffmpeg" title="thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">
</figure>


<p>There are several easy ways to take screenshots/thumbnails of movies using FFmpeg. But why do this in the first place?</p>



<ol><li>You might want to generate thumbnails for your videos and show those thumbnails to the user when he scrolls through the video. </li><li>Or, you might want to compare two videos by doing a side-by-side comparison – this is quite common in video compression research. </li></ol>



<p>FFmpeg offers very simple techniques to extract screenshots or thumbnails at any position of the video (or rather, a way to dump frames at any point you choose). </p>



<p>Let’s see how! </p>




<h2><span id="Single_Screenshot/Thumbnail_Using_frames_v"></span>Single Screenshot/Thumbnail Using <code>-frames:v</code><span></span></h2>



<p>First, let’s understand how to take a single screenshot or thumbnail using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -frames:v 1 foobar.jpeg</code></pre>



<p>Understanding this is very simple! Here goes – </p>



<ol><li><code>-ss</code> is the seek command and it can be used to seek to the right position. For accurate seeking, you need to use output seeking and not input seeking (i.e., putting <code>-ss</code> before the input sequence). The syntax for specifying the time is <code>HH:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS</code>. For example, you can tell FFmpeg to seek to&nbsp;<code>01:02:03</code>&nbsp;– i.e., the 3rd second of the 2nd minute of the 1 hour of the movie!</li><li><code>-frames:v 1</code> tells FFmpeg to take only 1 screenshot. Note that, <code>-vframes</code> is deprecated. </li><li>then, you mention the name of the output file (<code>screenshot_10.jpg</code>). </li></ol>



<p>Simple, wasn’t it? Now that you know how to produce a single thumbnail or screenshot, let’s move to the next section where we understand how to create regular or periodic thumbnails.</p>



<h2><span id="Periodic_Screenshot/Thumbnail_with_Resizing"></span>Periodic Screenshot/Thumbnail with Resizing<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is another common use case that FFmpeg can solve easily – <strong>how do you take screenshots/thumbnails at regular intervals, and store them to JPG files after resizing them?</strong></p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that can take care of creating a thumbnail and resizing it for you. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input1080p.mp4 -r 1 -s 1280x720 -f image2 screenshot-%03d.jpg</code></pre>



<p>The <code>-r</code> command sets the output frame rate (=1) and <code>image2</code> is an image file muxer that is used to write video frames to image files. Using the <code>-s 1280x720</code> command, we can resize the video frames before writing them as images. Note, that the input video is a 1920x1080p video.</p>



<p>The above command will take a screenshot every 1 second. The screenshots would be named <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, etc. because we have specified the formatting as <code>%3d</code>.</p>



<p>However, in my experience, I have found this technique<strong> to be not frame-accurate</strong>.</p>



<p>In the next section, let’s look at a more accurate way of extracting thumbnails. </p>



<h2><span id="Screenshot/Thumbnail_every_10_seconds"></span>Screenshot/Thumbnail every 10 seconds<span></span></h2>



<p>As an extension of the previous section, let’s do a quick exercise and learn how to create a thumbnail every 10 seconds using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n,300))',setpts='N/(30*TB)'" -f image2 thumbnail%03d.jpg</code></code></pre>



<p>Here, </p>



<ol><li>we use the <code>select</code> filter to extract a frame if the expression in single-quotes evaluates to non-zero. If the expression is zero, then <code>select</code> filter discards that frame.</li><li><code>mod(A,B)</code>&nbsp;returns the modulus (remainder after division) result after dividing A by B. So, if we divide 0 by 300, we get 0. Then, 1/300 is 1, and so on. </li><li><code>not</code> inverts this result. So, if the modulus is zero, then the final result is <code>1</code>. If the modulus is non-zero, then the result is evaluated to <code>zero</code>. </li><li>Based on this <code>not</code> operation, the <code>select</code> filter picks up a frame. </li></ol>



<p>The sequence I am using has a frame-rate of <code>30 fps</code>. And, I want a frame every 10 seconds. So, I have to choose a frame out of every 300 frames, right? That is why I used <code>select='not(mod(n,300))'</code></p>







<p>Depending on your sequence’s frame-rate, you can modify the command line shown. If you don’t know your video’s frame-rate, you can use <code>ffprobe</code> to find out. </p>



<pre><code>ffprobe -show_entries format=duration globe-with-timestamp.mp4</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – multiple easy ways to generate thumbnails and screenshots using FFmpeg. You can choose to take single screenshots or periodic ones with a highly frame-accurate technique! </p>

<p><i>After every crisis, some of the uncertainty becomes a part of our new reality. How, then, do you adapt and thrive when change is not a choice but inevitability? Let’s see.</i></p><p>Can you believe that Netflix is over two decades old?</p><p>The company has responded to changes (dot-com crash, global financial crisis, COVID-19) in a manner that in every period it seemed it belonged to those times, and sometimes even ahead of them. This once exclusively DVD-by-mail company started to build a streaming service in the early 2000s when most homes didn’t even have internet with enough bandwidth. Anticipating a shift in technology it sensed well in-advance how the consumption of media would change. The results? It has grown from 10m subscribers in 2010 to more than 160m in 2020.</p><p>We are good at finding solutions for today, but when it comes to the future, it’s human nature to see things in a state of positive permanence. Instinctively we tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events. And this makes us not so good at preparing for uncertainty, much less manage it.</p><p>Successful businesses prepare for the unknown and use uncertain times as a chance to rethink their working norms. The throes of COVID-19 have sent a reminder for business leaders that continual re-examination of ongoing practices and assumptions is paramount.</p><p><b>Here’s a guide to help business strategists act amid uncertainty – and leverage the times to up their adaptability quotient and position themselves for success. </b></p><h4>Resilience: An Antidote for Business Uncertainty</h4><p>Uncertainty brings outcomes we never predicted or saw coming – whether it be a fire breakout and pipe burst or global pandemic. The problem deepens when you are left in limbo and can’t tell for how long the adversity will last, such as the coronavirus pandemic where businesses are still wondering about the shape and extent of economic recovery, and long-term impact on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights">business models</a> and consumer behavior. After all, what do you hold onto when you make plans in uncertainty? </p><p>In such times, resilience can become a valued characteristic for businesses.</p><p>It is not possible for anyone to be fully prepared for the unknown. But resilient organizations learn to expect the unexpected. It helps them rebound more quickly than others and take first-mover advantage of many opportunities that emerge. </p><p>Resilience is not the resistance to change, but one’s ability to embrace change. And be ready for it. It is reflected in how you react to the uncertainty; how fast you bounce back; and in what health do you remain in afterward. Instead of attempting to preserve what worked in the past, resilient leaders push past their fears, brainstorm new ideas, and embrace large-scale disruption. </p><p>In nutshell, resilience is a sign of an organization’s capacity to come back stronger than ever after having been knocked down by uncertainty. </p><p>But, how do you do that? How do you ensure you that adverse situations bend you, and not break you?</p><p>Resilience starts where new perspective meets experience. It is cumulated in how you look at change. </p><p>Finding a way to rise from the ashes requires rewiring your thinking for resilience and reorganize. We suggest three steps to achieve that.</p><p><img src="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/images/survive-adapt.jpg"></p><p> First, make peace with uncertainty. Understand what has changed, what led to it, and the need to get your business back on its foot, instead of staying down and defeated. Then, change your perspective. Swap your question of why this is happening to what it is trying to teach me. Finally, make changes to your present and prepare yourself to better handle the adversity in the future. Focus on growing with new strategies in place.</p><p> Leaders must understand the value of each step for developing resilience in the organization. Those who just rebound and survive may fall into the same trap again when faced with adversity the next time.</p><h4>Ten Sage Advices to Respond to COVID-19 Uncertainty</h4><p> When facts on the ground are incomplete and in flux, what you need to put in place an operational business is experimentation. Develop a culture of responding to uncertainty by rapidly hypothesizing, testing, learning from new trials, and adapting to the models that work. Here are a few actions <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights/at-crossroads-taking-a-platform-approach-to-business">global business leaders</a> can take in this pandemic to beat the uncertainty blues and become resilient and agile.</p><ul><li><p><b>Operate with a sense of personal safety.</b> Great leadership is always about emotional connection. In this pandemic, as a primary responsibility, ensure that everyone in your organization is safe, secure, and healthy.</p></li><li><p><b> Achieve a level of business continuity.</b> Being functional, staying afloat, and carrying on is crucial in any uncertainty. Find a way to keep going on. Use virtual medium and collaborative tools. Focus on optimizing continuity thereafter.</p></li><li><p><b> Show signs of life.</b> Make your clients and customers know you are well and available.</p></li><li><p><b>Be less promotional &amp; more comforting in your messaging.</b> You can take either a direct marketing approach or you can be more sensitive by deploying a “hope all is well” campaign and the likes. Instead of a sales pitch, most global leaders are opting to touch base by asking about customers’/clients’ wellbeing and informing them of their availability lest they need their product or services.</p></li><li><p><b>Go multichannel and focus on customer-centricity.</b> Make a zero-tolerance declaration in your organization on any internal silos against customer-centricity. Ensure that your employees imbibe that in customers are the top priority in these times. Furthermore, don’t limit yourself to one channel for communication and operations. Experiment to find one or multiple best channels that best suit your needs.</p></li><li><p><b> Stay away from the herd mentality.</b> What is working for one company may not work for you. Find your new normal as you adapt every day. Mercilessly examine your weaknesses and vulnerabilities to become stronger for the long run. Destruct archaic practices to rebuild.</p></li><li><p><b>Keep a cool head.</b> It’s not uncommon for the dropping numbers to get your nerves. Don’t panic in these situations. It’s needless. Take a step back and see what you are left with. Gratitude for what you have can open a new world of possibilities. Look toward the long-term for more motivation.</p></li><li><p><b> Organize for rapid decision-making.</b> Uncertainty catches one off-guard. If you aren’t prepared, a crisis will overwhelm you. Distribute leadership responsibilities across your organization such that your employees are self-motivated and empowered to make decisions and operate with speed. A large part of this change is to give yourself (as an organization) the permission to be wrong in case things go south.</p></li><li><p><b>Make your offerings relevant to the times.</b> Use the uncertainty to gauge where customers’ propensities lie or would change in the future. Leverage new mediums and products/services of their choice to redesign your offerings and innovate.</p></li><li><p><b>Collaboration is the key to build resilience.</b> Startups are seen as a threat by incumbents, and vice-versa. However, a variety of collaborations between startups and incumbents can help each party survive, adapt, and thrive. Right collaboration would make it easy for both to raise capital, reduce cost, and position for growth. Forge joint ventures, or project-based relationship to come up with disruptive value propositions.</p></li></ul><h4> To Sum</h4><p> What type of leadership does uncertainty demand? The answer lies in resilience and agility. Enduring hard times are about leveraging, and not reacting to the turbulence around you. Lead by preparing your teams and organization to recreate the future with you. Adopt a new perspective to carve new normal, set a new vision, and imbibe new practices.</p><p><b> Business strategists who successfully lead their organizations through uncertainty not only survive, but also shields them from future disruptions by growing their adaptability quotient.</b></p>

  <p><span>03 Oct 2020</span></p><p>Disney Animation’s Moana island dataset is a production-scale scene with memory requirements that make it challenging to render. This post summarizes some of those challenges, and describes how the <a href="https://github.com/chellmuth/gpu-motunui">GPU-Motunui</a> project is able to efficiently render the scene on a consumer-grade GPU with less than 8GB of memory. <a href="#renders">Click here</a> to skip ahead to the results.</p>

<h2 id="the-moana-island">The Moana island</h2>

<p>In 2018, Disney Animation released the Moana island dataset to the rendering research community. Compared to traditional research scenes, the scale of the Moana island scene is massive: the scene contains 90 million quad primitives, 5 million curves, and more than 28 million instances. All told, the island consists of over 15 billion primitives, weighing in at just under 30GB of geometry files.</p>

<p>The shots included with the dataset are beautiful, and showcase the amazing imagery that can be created by combining the best artists in the world with path tracing techniques and modern hardware. Here are two reference images, rendered with Disney’s proprietary Hyperion renderer:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="gpu-motunui-project">GPU-Motunui Project</h2>

<p>The goal of the GPU-Motunui project is to render all the Moana shots efficiently and accurately on a consumer-grade graphics card. There are two main challenges to accomplishing this with the Moana dataset. First, with a typical graphics card having only 8GB of memory, an out-of-core rendering solution is required to handle the large amounts of geometry. Second, the scene’s textures are provided in the Ptex format, and Ptex doesn’t have a publicly available CUDA implementation. This project currently only solves the first problem, and Ptex texture lookup is done on the CPU (although conveniently its cost is fully hidden by being computed concurrently with GPU shadow ray tracing).</p>

<p>The Hyperion reference images are impossible to match exactly; for example the varying brown and green colors along the palm tree fronds in the palmsCam shot are not provided in the dataset. Other features of the scene are possible to render but out of my initial scope, notably subdivision surfaces and their displacement maps, and a full Disney BSDF implementation.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/hyperion-unique-palmsCam.png" alt="Example of an unreproducible material variation on the palm tree frond"></p><p>Example of an unreproducible material variation on the palm tree frond</p>
</div>

<p>All ray tracing operations are run through Nvidia’s OptiX 7 API. This means GPU-Motunui gets the full benefits of available RT cores and a world-class BVH implementation. The following sections describe how GPU-Motunui maps dataset assets to OptiX data structures, and how GPU-Motunui’s out-of-core rendering solution works.</p>

<h3 id="scene-representation">Scene representation</h3>

<p>The Moana scene makes widespread use of multi-level instancing. In OptiX, this requires a three-level hierarchy of acceleration structures to manage: two levels of IASs, and a base level of GASs (Instance Acceleration Structures and Geometry Acceleration Structures, respectively). GPU-Motunui makes use of OptiX’s AS compaction and relocation APIs to further reduce memory usage.</p>

<p>The isHibiscus element makes a good example of how a typical element in the scene is organized and built. The tree is assembled from a base model in one Wavefront .obj file (containing the trunk and branches), and four primitives: one flower and three leaf models (each with their own .obj file).</p>

<div>

<p>Left: The four simple primitives that will be instanced to fill out the hibiscus tree <br>Right: The base trunk and branches model </p>
</div>

<p>In OptiX, each of these models has an associated GAS, and each GAS can be subdivided into multiple build inputs. Build inputs are used to map sections of the model to information needed at shading time by indexing into OptiX’s shader binding table. These GASs form the bottom level of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Next, an IAS is used to build the full isHibiscus element. This IAS is in the middle level of the hierarchy. The figure below shows each primitive’s instances in isolation, and combined to make the full element:</p>

<div>

<p>Left: Isolated instances for each primitive<br>Right: Full isHibiscus element</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, a second IAS is built to track all of the element’s instances present in the scene. This second IAS is the top level of the instance hierarchy.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/isHibiscus-instanced-elements.png" alt="The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances"></p><p>The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances</p>
</div>

<p>Although the isHibiscus element has a typical structure, there are some more complicated elements included in the dataset. The isCoral element, for example, has different base geometry and instanced primitives for each of its element instances, but the underlying primitive geometries are shared across all the element instances.</p>

<p>The Moana GAS and IASs alone require 18.5 GB, well past the memory budget of my 8GB RTX 2070. Because OptiX has no native support for out-of-core rendering, the traditional OptiX pipeline had to be put aside for a custom-made solution.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-core-rendering">Out-of-core rendering</h3>

<p>To solve the out-of-core rendering problem, GPU-Motunui divides the scene’s geometry into different sections, and ray traces each separately, while tracking the closest hit. Replacing a traditional device trace call with a host loop comes with many design consequences to the renderer, from asset loading to the core path tracing loop that sends rays through the scene.</p>

<p>Before rendering, the asset loading process allocates a large chunk of GPU memory (currently 6.7GB). A custom allocator is implemented that manages this block of memory. It is responsible for allocating two types of memory: output and temporary. Output memory is allocated from the left of the block, and is used for OptiX structures. Temporary memory is managed on a stack from the right end of the memory block. Managing the temporary memory this way ensures that the output structures are always tightly packed.</p>

<p>After elements are processed into their accelerator structures on the GPU, their used memory is snapshotted onto the host, and the allocator is cleared. The process is repeated until all of the scene’s geometry is processed, resulting in the host managing a list of GPU memory snapshots. The figure below shows an example layout of GPU memory that could be snapshotted:</p>

<div>
  <p>GPU memory layout after loading the isHibiscus element.<br>(Dotted arrows show that an IAS holds instances of the pointed-at AS)</p>

</div>

<p>As mentioned above, when it comes time to ray trace, each snapshot is processed in a loop. This means a call to <code>cudaMemcpy</code> and <code>optixLaunch</code> for each snapshot. A global buffer is maintained that indicates the depth of the current closest intersection. This value is used as the <code>tmax</code> parameter for the CUDA kernel’s call to <code>optixTrace</code>, and a successful intersection will update the depth buffer for the next launch.</p>

<p>In a traditional OptiX path tracer, the entire render loop can run in device code inside a single call to <code>optixLaunch</code>; i.e., a successful intersection will lead to more BSDF and shadow rays being traced in the same kernel launch. Because GPU-Motunui’s design mandates multiple launches for tracing each path segment, the render loop is pulled out into host code. While this potentially diminishes OptiX’s ability to efficiently schedule program execution, it also opens up opportunties for optimization, such as running Ptex texture lookups on the CPU concurrently with GPU kernels and I/O.</p>

<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>As with any OptiX application, GPU-Motunui makes use of the shader binding table (SBT). SBT records contain pointers to normal buffers and material attributes. The underlying data for the normal buffers is stored alongside OptiX acceleration structures and included in geometry snapshots. This ensures that GPU memory is never wasted on unreachable normal buffer data.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>
<p>Included below are GPU-Motunui renders of the six scenes included in the dataset. shotCam is the slowest to render at 18.2 seconds per sample at 1024x429 resolution, and took just over five hours total for the final image. All shots are 1024spp, capped at a maximum of five bounces, and were run on an Nvidia RTX 2070.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>The initial implementation of the renderer required 42.6 seconds per 1spp on the shotCam scene. A few optimizations combined to make significant reductions in rendering time, cutting each pass down to 18.2 seconds (a 57.3% reduction).</p>

<h4 id="cpugpu-concurrency">CPU/GPU concurrency</h4>
<p>Tracing shadow rays on the GPU in parallel with Ptex lookups on the CPU cut rendering time by 23.4%. It was disappointing to be forced to do texture lookups on the CPU, but the time savings make up for it.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-ptex-caches">Multiple Ptex caches</h4>
<p>Parallelizing the Ptex lookups and using multiple Ptex caches eliminated texture lookups as a bottleneck to the system; shadow ray casting time fully dominates the texture lookup. Empirically, spawning two threads per core (totaling 12 on an Intel i7-8700K) and sharing three Ptex caches comfortably reduced the texture lookup time beneath the shadow ray budget. This improved the time savings to a 33.9% reduction over the baseline.</p>

<h4 id="pinned-memory">Pinned memory</h4>
<p>The acceleration structure snapshots are all saved to pinned host memory. Switching from normal to pinned host memory increased the transfer throughput from 7.73 GB/s to 11.84 GB/s, cutting the baseline render time by 19.5%.</p>

<h2 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h2>
<p>Getting this scene running on my RTX 2070 card was a very fun and rewarding project, but there are still many improvements to be made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing the Disney BSDF</li>
  <li>Rendering subdivision surfaces along with displacement mapping</li>
  <li>More efficiently packing the acceleration structures, and optimizing ray tracing throughput</li>
  <li>Experimenting with how various research results hold up on production scenes (e.g., testing select path guiding techniques)</li>
</ul>

Although <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> is a strong choice if you have paying subscribers, it is impossible to beat static hosting for a simple blog. Static sites are fast, secure, and free.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of my reasoning and approach - from editing in Ghost's world-class UI to deploying for free on a static hosting provider like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>I was looking for a blogging solution that met these requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Slick UI:</strong> Even though I use vim and markdown daily, I prefer a Medium-like freeform writing experience.</li><li><strong>Self-hosted: </strong>Full control of my content with no vendor lock-in, paywalls, or subscription pop-ups.</li><li><strong>High availability:</strong> I should never receive a monitoring alert for my personal blog.</li><li><strong>Exceptional performance:</strong> I want the page to load fast!</li><li><strong>Secure and low-maintenance:</strong> After supporting dozens of WordPress sites over more than a decade, I have grown weary of hacked plugins and frequent patching cycles.</li></ul><h2 id="static-ghost-io-">Static Ghost.io 👻</h2><p>Even though I use markdown every day in my work, I prefer the WYSIWYG writing experience of a web UI. Ghost's UI is fantastic!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/10/nm_ghost.png"></figure><p>The main drawback of Ghost is the same as WordPress: every request depends on a database. Each time a user visits a page on the site, the following steps take place:</p><ol><li>The web server passes the end user's request to a running application server (Node.js for Ghost, PHP for WordPress).</li><li>The application server analyzes the incoming request and dispatches requests to the database for necessary content (MySQL for Ghost).</li><li>The application server renders the content from the database into a web page.</li><li>The web server passes the resulting page back to the end user.</li></ol><p>This architecture requires significant compute and memory resources on both the application server and database server. &nbsp;It is susceptible to performance issues due to spikes in demand. And achieving high availability requires a database cluster and web load balancer. Lots of distinct parts to deploy, secure, and operate.</p><p>The advent of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> architecture has brought static sites into the limelight. By moving steps 2 and 3 <strong>to the beginning</strong>, Ghost can generate each page on the site <strong>in advance</strong>. Then, it's easy to upload the static site to a free or almost-free hosting provider (see below for suggestions).</p><blockquote>Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers. - JAMstack</blockquote><p>Static sites have a significantly smaller attack surface than sites driven by databases and application code. Bugs, vulnerabilities, and build issues can be identified by the build phase, rather than when the site is live. </p><p>You get the rich editing of Ghost while enjoying all of the operational and cost advantages of a static JAM site:</p><ul><li>Never worry about scaling when traffic spikes.</li><li>Never apply a critical security patch at midnight.</li><li>Who cares if your Ghost database is temporarily down?</li></ul><h2 id="making-ghost-static">Making Ghost Static</h2><p>First, setup a <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/setup/">private Ghost instance</a> to use for editing, formatting, and peer review. This can be a very small VM, since it doesn't have to serve any production traffic. Defying traditional best-practices, it's even safe to co-locate MySQL on the same system! <a href="https://valet.ghost.org/">Ghost(Valet)</a> is very reasonably priced if you need a hand with this step.</p><p>You can secure access to this system with a firewall or VPN. A better approach is to use an authentication proxy like <a href="https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy">oauth2-proxy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium">pomerium</a> for a user-friendly, "zero trust" solution.</p><p>Then, use Ghost Static Site Generator (<code>gssg</code>) &nbsp;to create a static mirror of the site that is hosted by Netlify:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator"><div><p>Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p>Generate a static site from ghost and deploy using a CI - Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19606031?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p><code>gssg</code> will spider your local Ghost site, creating a fully static copy.

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>So first off a personal update – last year, I got laid off the day I returned from maternity leave! Within a half hour of returning to my desk! Whew boy! It was a blessing in disguise in some ways, because 1) I’d been thinking for some time I could be more effective in a consulting role and 2) as part of my severance package, I got to attend a General Assembly coding bootcamp.</p>

<p>I ended up auditing the bootcamp because wow, it demands a ton of sacrifice with the end goal of getting a developer job. In contrast, I am happy to do a bit of scripting on the side, work with developers, and improve their experiences. Nonetheless, I worked through all the lectures, did a few homework assignments, and got a lot out of it. Not the least of which is that I validated my existing coding skills, gained deeper insight into the “junior developer” persona, and reaffirmed my conviction that tailoring your developer experience and docs to junior developers is a <strong>Good Thing</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of big takeaways I’d like to share:</p>

<h3 id="everyone-is-a-junior-developer">Everyone is a junior developer</h3>

<p>Well, no, not actually … but every developer has to learn new concepts.  And yes, of course, as you gain experience as a developer, “totally new” concepts get rarer and rarer. Still, there’s a lot of learning:</p>

<p>Some developers must learn a breakneck pace (think of all the Javascript frameworks coming out all the time! Those front-end folks have to sprint just to stay in place). Others face big disruptions to their coding world only occasionally (your Enterprise Java programmer with a 20 year career in monolithic app development who now lives in a brave new world of microservices, CI/CD, devops, oh my!)</p>

<p>I felt I experienced this disruption myself as part of the coding bootcamp. Up till then, my background was in writing Python scripts, and in documenting big Java applications in a analytics microservices context. I knew about RedHat, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, Lucene, Cassandra, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I was learning about a whole new world: the ecosystems, the mindset, the business of ….  JavaScript.  Like probably many people outside the JavaScript world, I was fooled by the “script” part of the name – especially since I’d only used JavaScript myself to write macros in an XML docs tool.  Now I realize it’s <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/article/2886368/java-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mindshare.html">epic battle</a> between Java and JavaScript. And while I haven’t fallen in love (Python, you still have my heart), I had lots of “oh, that’s neat!” moments. I also recognized that my learning curve was not dissimilar to that of experienced – but JavaScript-naïve – developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point:</p>

<h3 id="we-should-all-design-for-the-junior-developer">We should all design for the junior developer</h3>

<p>Creating experiences with a junior developer in mind forces you to discard your comfy assumption that everyone’s drunk your product Kool-aid. If you assume you’re writing for someone who’s technically savvy and can learn quickly, but who knows nothing about your world, you’re positioning yourself to vastly decrease your developer onboarding friction. And if you assume that your “junior developer” is super impatient because they have, like, 10 other things on the docket to learn about, then you’ll learn to answer up front the question: “why should I care? Why should I do this work?”</p>

<p>It’s a fine line to tread, assuming not too much about technical knowledge, but also not coming across as condescending or silly (like, at the level of “open a terminal by taking the following steps…”). Still, I think it’s actually quite achievable. For example, it’s quite low effort to provide high-level context for coding instructions. Even something as simple as “Clone this repository and open a terminal at the local directory location” is a direction that often gets left out in GitHub readmes…but it really shouldn’t be left out.  And it never hurts to link to frameworks’ getting started guides, even if you don’t want to provide the details yourself. At the very least, no one is likely to roll their eyes at it, and it helps your reader understand what level of granularity your instructions will provide.</p>

<p>When I look for inspiration, I think the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React newbie tutorials</a> do an outstanding job of introducing junior developers to React, helping them understand why they should care, and explicitly stating their audience. I also really love (who doesn’t) the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe developer onboarding</a> experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think I came away from the coding bootcamp more confident that I <em>am</em> a junior developer. And while I’d never make the classic UX mistake of thinking I am the user, still – my confusions, my pain points in learning about a product– these are things that other developers likely share.</p>

<h3 id="postscript-fun-with-javascript">Postscript: Fun with Javascript!</h3>

<p>I’ll end on another personal note. The coding bootcamp turned out to be quite serendipitous, because I took on contracting work that immediately benefited from my new knowledge. I’d just learned about Express, and now here I was, entering a pull request to change the authentication method for an Express server. I’d just learned about React, and now here I was, wading into a web UI to change some text. It’s always nice when you can put what you’ve learned to immediate use.</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you have any questions for the MulticoreWare team, please get in touch with Shivakumar Narayanan at <a aria-label="x266@multicorewareinc.com (opens in a new tab)" href="mailto:x266@multicorewareinc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">x266@multicorewareinc.com</a>.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better onboarding retention, get users to add value to your product as quickly as possible.</p><p>How?</p><h2>1. Create shortcuts to show only the relevant information (screen by preferences).</h2><p>Spotify asks users to select their favorite artists instead of going to dashboard:</p><figure id="w-node-213b4e788a3d-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8809c116cb645d12bb4594_spotify-onboarding.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you are a SaaS&nbsp;company that sells form building software, you could for example, ask what type of form the person is looking to create, then based on that selection provide an appropriate form template. This helps the user accomplish their task more quickly and they are more likely to stick with you after they've seen the value of your product.</p><h2>2. Take out unnecessary steps or save them for after the user has added value.</h2><p>SproutSocial does this well by instantly prompting to connect to social media accounts FIRST, and only then asking for additional information.</p><figure id="w-node-7da55c5c0f57-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880ef541456e5a30b5034b_SproutSocial%20Additional%20Connections.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>First the user is asked to connect their social profiles (this instantly populates their dashboard with valuable insights)</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-ac84d3ff6921-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880272ff20a95ceb04363c_sproutsocial.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Then the user is asked to answer some questions that will help SproutSocial segment their audience. Notice how there were no massive forms to fill out - this is key.</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Try checklists which encourage user to take small steps to engage with your product or add their own value.</h2><p>There are all sorts of ways to present this (header notice, widget, embedded, welcome email)</p><figure id="w-node-ef9c31814aa4-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88028112b0af3c3a1e504b_checklist.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Gamify with progression. Start them off with some steps already completed.</h2><p>If you are already using a checklist in your app's dashboard, you can start them off with some progress already made so that the user doesn't feel like they are starting from zero. </p><p>For example, you can cross off an item they've already completed (see above screenshot). </p><p>You could start them off at 20% instead of 0% when it comes to completing various steps to get to the "aha" moment of your product.</p><p>In multi-step onboarding you could visually indicate that the first step is already finished (presumably the 1st click to the form).</p><h2>5. Assist with templates - so user only has to modify contents.</h2><p><a href="http://pory.io/">Pory.io</a> is great at this. Instead of just dropping you off to let you figure out the tool on your own, they provide you with starting templates.</p><figure id="w-node-129cbdb09480-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802a8b78d93b942995c83_Pory.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If templates do not apply, you could add placeholder content so people know how to edit and where to start. Templates are a great way to get people to skip all the busy work of starting from scratch and provide a semi-finished starting point. </p><p>Canva does an excellent job by allowing people to select an asset they wish to create, and present fully-designed examples that only require some tweaking.</p><h2>6. If integrating with other tools, show personalized how-to videos specific to the integration.</h2><p>Most SaaS&nbsp;companies add their integration instructions in support documents. If the user has to leave your dashboard and hunt down support docs, they could just as easily go do something else. </p><p>By providing relevant integration videos within the dashboard, you keep the user engaged and more likely to finish the setup.</p><p>Memberstack provides a handy Webflow integration tutorial for people who are building in Webflow.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b21132cc9f9c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802dd24f28319c733480d_memberstack.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. Try adding integrations into the onboarding flow after they've already created an account</h2><p>If your tool or app integrates with other popular platforms, consider adding those integrations into the onboarding flow. </p><p>You often see companies have an "integrations" tab or section in their app, but very few add those to onboarding. </p><p>We can bypass the standard behavior and ask the user to integrate with a popular tool in a multi-step onboarding process. They have the option to skip, but once they add a one or two click connection, they are more likely to get hooked or have a chance to expose your product to everyone at their company.</p><h2>8. Reward with points and prizes if appropriate.</h2><p>Duolingo gives users virtual "lingots" which encourage user to keep going in order to collect enough to spend them.</p><figure id="w-node-ef0778b73aac-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803008701da7f3ec23ae7_duolingo-lingots.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. Provide the benefit of your product first, then ask user to create an account to save their work</h2><p><a href="http://priar.io/">Priar.io</a> does this by letting you preview their product with YOUR content before hitting "Generate link" to create an account.</p><figure id="w-node-6eeed1f77289-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88032af52d301ff3d87f39_piar.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. If product benefits from multiple people using it, prompt user to invite those people.</h2><p>BetterUptime prompts you to invite your colleagues as additional users:</p><figure id="w-node-3a1237c05f92-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88034b16cb640d52bb33e6_better-uptime.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. Gift them with an upgraded version of their selected price tier, or gift full access.</h2><p>Netflix does this well by offering a free upgrade at the time of the trial.</p><figure id="w-node-ecd982c93506-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803bff7e683308565cef1_41.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></div>]]>
