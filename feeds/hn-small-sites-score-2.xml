<p>Two years ago, on June 4th of 2018, Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, unicorn darling of the developer tools startup ecosystem, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">for $7.5B in stock</a>. The announcement unearthed a wide range of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17221527" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opinions and pontifications</a>, ranging from “GitHub is doomed” to “Microsoft is smart”, with many predictions about GitHub’s future. Some thought Microsoft’s growing investments in its cloud offering, Azure, might help GitHub. Could an investment by Microsoft improve GitHub’s reliability or harden them against outages like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDOSes</a>? Have any of these predictions come true?</p>



<p>We set out to analyze one angle of the GitHub acquisition: Has GitHub become more reliable since its acquisition by Microsoft? Our service, <a href="https://statusgator.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">StatusGator</a>, monitors more than 700 status pages of cloud providers and SaaS companies large and small. We aggregate and normalize status page data and make it available to our subscribers however they need: in notifications by email, Slack, Teams, or webhook, and in a <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/01/24/how-to-save-precious-minutes-during-incident-response/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">unified status dashboard</a> for all service dependencies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-1024x613.png" alt="" srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-1024x613.png 1024w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-300x180.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-768x460.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-1536x919.png 1536w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-720x431.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-580x347.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1-320x192.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-header-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For more than 5 years, we have analyzed the <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub status page</a> constantly. Every 5 minutes, StatusGator takes a screenshot and <a href="https://statusgator.com/services/github" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">collects relevant data</a> about their service status. That means we are uniquely positioned to offer analysis of the downtime that GitHub themselves announce via their status page.</p>



<p>What does the data tell us? In the two years since the acquisition announcement, GitHub has reported a 41% increase in status page incidents. Furthermore, there has been a 97% increase in incident minutes, compared to the two years prior to the announcement. Does this actually point to a decrease in reliability? We can’t say. This could simply mean GitHub has increased its transparency, publishing to their status page more frequently.</p>



<h2>Incident Counts</h2>



<p>We calculated an incident count in the 24 months preceding the announcement and the 24 months after. We <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/26/under-the-hood-inside-a-status-page-aggregator/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">classify status pages</a> into four states: <em>up</em>, <em>warn</em>, and <em>down</em>, and <em>maintenance</em>. GitHub does not expose scheduled maintenance on their status page. For these calculations we consider an incident to be any change in status between <em>up</em> and <em>warn</em> or <em>down</em>.</p>



<p>Before the acquisition, there were 89 incidents published on the GitHub status page. After, there were 126 incidents. A 41% increase:</p>

<p>In the graph below, we’ve charted the incident counts by month. The left side shows the 24 months before and the right side shows the 24 months after:</p>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png" alt="Graph showing GitHub incidents by month, before and after their acquisition by Microsoft." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png 1024w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-300x156.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-768x400.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1536x799.png 1536w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-720x375.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-580x302.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-320x167.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<h2>Incident Minutes</h2>



<p>We calculated incident minutes by subtracting the start and end time of time of incidents. Although not 100% realtime, StatusGator checks frequently: every 5 minutes, so status page changes are detected quickly. We counted time where the page was not in an overall <em>up</em> state.</p>



<p>In the 24 months prior to the acquisition announcement, there were 6,110 minutes of downtime. During the 24 months after, there were 12,074 minutes of downtime, a 97% increase:</p>

<h2>Status Page Evolution</h2>



<p>During these four years, GitHub has made enormous improvements in their status page information granularity and design. In December 2018, they switched from a home grown status page to one operated by Atlassian’s StatusPage service, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/03/11/2019-statusgator-status-page-awards/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">the most popular status page provider</a>. In doing so, they added numerous <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/11/22/component-status-filtering-is-here/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">individual component statuses</a>. Here’s what GitHub’s status page looked like before their switch to Atlassian StatusPage:</p>



<h3>GitHub’s Old Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png" alt="GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png 645w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-300x187.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-580x361.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-320x199.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When they switched to their new status page format, GitHub took a huge step towards increased accountability and transparency by detailing the following individual service components:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Issues, PRs, Dashboard, Projects</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Gists</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<p>Overtime, they have expanded and refined their component statuses. They also started showing historical data right on their status page. As you can see in their newest and most detailed status page format, it shows the following service component statuses:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Issues, PRs, Projects</li><li>GitHub Actions</li><li>GitHub Packages</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<h3>GitHub’s New Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png" alt="GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png 944w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-277x300.png 277w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-768x833.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-720x781.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-580x629.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-320x347.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service.</figcaption></figure>



<p>They also moved their status page to a dedicated domain, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">githubstatus.com</a>, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">which follows a best practice we recommend</a> to anyone who hosts a status page. All of this additional transparency, details, and historical data is a commendable effort to relay the most up-to-date information about the status of all GitHub systems. More providers of critical cloud infrastructure should emulate what GitHub has done. <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/07/your-status-page-is-useless-if-you-dont-use-it/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Your status page is useless if you don’t use it.</a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What can we conclude from all of this data? Objectively, we can conclude that GitHub has published to their status page more frequently in the two years after their acquisition announcement. They have posted more incidents of disruption and downtime. Those incidents have been longer in duration. According to the data they provided, GitHub has been down more since the acquisition by Microsoft. </p>



<p>But that could be all a part of coordinated effort to be more transparent about their service status, an effort that should be applauded.</p>



<p>Our goal at StatusGator is not to shame anyone for disruptions and outages. Everyone experiences unexpected downtime. We simply strive to make status page data available and accessible in more useful ways. From Slack and <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/03/status-page-monitoring-in-microsoft-teams/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Microsoft Teams</a>, to <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/30/status-page-webhooks-new-and-improved/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">webhooks</a>, an API, and more. StatusGator aggregates status page data and empowers you to keep your team informed. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coronavirus and the lockdowns it forced has probably sped up the transition to working from home in many jobs by at least a decade. Workers who previously spend time sitting in cubicles or offices found out they could have just as well worked from home. Millions started looking for software that would help them do that. </p>
<p>Enter Zoom, a somewhat popular video-conferencing program made all the way back in 2011. It was already fairly popular before the pandemic, but this year it’s popularity has exploded. The daily average user numbers went from around 10 million in December to over 300 million in April. </p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Zoom became the go-to choice for many mainly because it’s really easy to use and free (well at least the basic version is) The usually highlighted advantages of Zoom are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple and easy to use interface</li>
<li>good audio and video quality</li>
<li>smooth and easy to set up conference calls even for large groups up to 100 people</li>
<li>compatibility with various systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS</li>
<li>ability to share slides and content</li>
<li>scheduling conferences via a calendar that can be shared with others</li>
<li>virtual backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>Zoom also helped itself by making the program free to use for K-12 schools in the US since early March, just as the lockdowns were starting. It also received a lot of free publicity from famous users, even the UK government used it to host sessions.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Well, it’s not all as rosy as it sounds. Zoom has been involved in some controversies that have become more and more apparent as it gained popularity. The main point of criticism has been lackluster security. </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019 Apple was forced to remove Zoom from Macs after it turned out a security flaw could let websites hijack users’ cameras. Although the company quickly addressed this with fixes and a lengthy blog post, it wasn’t a good look.</li>
<li>Zoom has no end-to-end encryption, despite some advertising materials claiming otherwise. It stores all the keys involved in user data encryption in its own cloud infrastructure. Which means it can access user data at will.</li>
<li>Zoom calls have random generated IDs consisting between 9 and 11 digits and these can apparently be brute-forced or even randomly guessed which means hackers can get into meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flaws were pretty notorious and led to a phenomenon called <em>zoom bombing</em> where pranksters would join meetings to broadcast inappropriate content. It got so bad the FBI had to officially warn schools.</p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<p>Remember that thing about Zoom having access to user data? Well, it turns out that’s not an accident.</p>
<ul>
<li>This month Zoom admitted to closing three meetings commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown and suspended the accounts of activists who organized them. This led to teachers voicing concerns about how they’re supposed to cover such topics in classes hosted on the platform.</li>
<li>In April the New York Times found out Zoom’s data mining feature was automatically sending user’s names and emails to LinkedIn allowing participants to access other users’ profile data.</li>
<li>In March Motherboard found out Zoom’s iOS app was automatically sending device analytics to Facebook without informing the user and did it even if the user did not have a Facebook account. There was no mention of this in the privacy policy either.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far this has led to a couple of lawsuits, an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission and outright bans from some tech companies and the UK’s ministry of defense. Not good news for the company to put it mildly. Yet despite all that Zoom is still hugely popular and looks like it will stay that way despite its flaws. To be fair it’s not like it’s main competitors like Microsoft Teams and Google Hangouts don’t have any either, so pick your poison.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

<p>After publishing the URU Key project people keep asking me to make it open source. I have tried to organize sources in a more readable way but I still think that plain C and ESP IDF are too difficult for the broad audience. And, unfortunately, the biometrics part is covered by NDA and can not be published.</p>
<p>Therefore I am starting a new project to address these and other issues.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-form-factor">Size and form factor</h2>
<p>A few months ago I have finalized the <a href="https://en.ovcharov.me/2020/04/06/uru-key-final-hardware-design/">URU Key hardware design</a> and started working on housing for it. Yes, it is very small and lightweight but carrying it around is a kind of a problem. The device is too fragile to be worn on the keyring and a bit thick to put in the pocket. The necklace is not my style.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/31ed3b469871b100ae43a0dbae4930d2f3fb272b/61808/uploads/resized/uru-key-w800.jpg" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/31ed3b469871b100ae43a0dbae4930d2f3fb272b/61808/uploads/resized/uru-key-w800.jpg" data-srcset="/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w150.jpg 150w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w300.jpg 300w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w600.jpg 600w, /uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w800.jpg 800w, /uploads%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Furu-key.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 150px, (max-width: 380px) 300px, (max-width: 680px) 600px, (max-width: 880px) 800px, 1200px" alt="URU Key with the battery" title="URU Key with the battery" srcset="https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w150.jpg 150w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w300.jpg 300w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w600.jpg 600w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2Fresized%2Furu-key-w800.jpg 800w, https://en.ovcharov.me/uploads%2F2020%2F06%2F29%2Furu-key.jpg 1200w"><figcaption>URU Key with the battery</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, my wallet is always with me. The PCB sized as a standard credit card should perfectly fit there. The power source becomes a problem, that’s true. But, wait, is it difficult to find a charger or power bank with Micro USB nowadays?</p>

<p>The name <strong>URU Card</strong> makes a lot of sense for this project, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>As on one hand, I can not use biometrics for open source project and on other hand, I do not want to omit the authentication completely leaving the device insecure there is a need for some form of user verification. Simple touch keyboard and OLED screen should allow people to enter pin code or password.</p>
<figure>

<p>The keyboard should be implemented with the <strong>MPR121</strong> I2C touch-sensor controller, and the screen is a widely available <strong>OLED</strong> screen with the <strong>SSD1306</strong> controller. The screen is placed in the special cut in the PCB keeping the device thickness below 2 millimetres.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-development">Framework for the development</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Arduino</strong> framework is ported to the <strong>ESP32</strong> platform. There are hundreds of libraries for almost every use case and this factor should significantly simplify the project. There are libraries for <strong>ATECC508A</strong>, <strong>MPR121</strong> and <strong>SSD1306</strong> already. All that is needed is to wire everything together.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino IDE will be hardly usable for a project complex like this one. I am going to use Visual Studio Code + <strong>PlatformIO</strong> for the development and recommend others to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-project">The current state of the project</h2>
<p>At the moment the working <strong>BLE server</strong> with <strong>FIDO2</strong> endpoints is implemented. The device is “visible” and the computer connects to it in order to perform an authentication procedure. However, the commands are not implemented yet - it’s going to be the next step.</p>

<p>There is a PCB design as well and you can try to build the device, but do it on your own risk - it’s in a very early stage now.</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-project">Joining the project</h2>
<p>Sweetest part. The project is free to join for everyone. The minimal requirement is just an ESP32 development board like the one below.</p>

      <p><time datetime="2020-06-27 00:00:00 +0000">27 Jun 2020</time></p><p>Having your application produce the right amount and quality of logs will help you debug faster, optimize better and keep your data safe and secure. I was always fascinated with logging and tried to figure out the best ways to log and create telemetry for my applications.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to work with multiple startups, I came into close contact with all of Node.js’ major logging packages. Lately, I had the luck to work with highly security aware businesses, for whom security is an existential threat. When tasked with the challenge of creating secure applications for them, I knew without hesitation that I had to create a new library to meet all the new requirements that were at play.</p>

<p>I want to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a>, a versatile and powerful logger for Node.js.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/planning.jpg" alt="Logging Flow"></p>

<h2 id="the-logging-requirements">The Logging Requirements</h2>

<p>These are the logging requirements that were on the drawing board when Logality was first implemented. I could find some of them in some packages, but not all of them in one package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#a-common-logging-schema"><strong>Complete Flexibility on Properties</strong></a>. In order for my organization to have a common logging schema, it is required of the logging library to allow the definition of properties from scratch. A lot of the packages make those decisions for you leaving you with no options to normalize the logging schema. The most common example for this is the date field, you can find it as <code>dt</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>timestamp</code> or any other variance, without any option to change the name.</li>
  <li><a href="#serializers-of-data-objects"><strong>Serializers of Data Objects</strong></a>. As <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> is primarily a JSON logger, dealing with data is the most common operation. Being able to serialize known data structures is key in this case. Just drop your user data object to logality and the built-in or your custom serializer will make sure to transform the object so only what you want will be logged.</li>
  <li><a href="#custom-output-and-pretty-print"><strong>Support Custom Outputs</strong></a>. Logality’s Default output is JSON but the library should not limit you as to the kind of output you want, for instance print human readable logs while on development. Custom outputs also allow you to filter log messages so you can suppress dynamically certain types or log levels of messages.</li>
  <li><a href="#logging-metadata"><strong>Logging Metadata</strong></a>. Have the logger automatically log the location of the file that the log originated from. As well as other useful system information (OS version, runtime info, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="#the-power-of-middleware"><strong>Middleware Support</strong></a>. Supporting middleware is a very powerful way to transform and augment each one of your log messages. The options that this feature opens up are endless.</li>
  <li><a href="#linking-multiple-logality-instances"><strong>Logging for Libraries</strong></a>. All open source contributors must have faced this challenge at least once: How do I output logs from my library? This is no easy task, Logality provides an eloquent and powerful solution to this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these requirements in place, <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> was created on May 18, 2018. Ever since then the library has been iteratively improving and bug fixed. Today, the current Version is 3.0.0, which was released on April of 2020. In the following sections, we will go through a more detailed analysis of the features and powerful capabilities of Logality.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-logging-schema">A Common Logging Schema</h2>

<p>The more standardized your log messages are, the easier it will be to query, parse and subsequently analyze them. Consequently, your log messages need to have a schema. As we all know, the most ubiquitous format for text based serialization today, is JSON.</p>

<p>Logality is a JSON logger that provides an initial recommendation of a logging schema but allows you to define your own schemas down to the last property.</p>

<p>This is a very important feature. When you are trying to have a common logging schema across multiple operating systems, platforms and programming languages, it is essential that your tooling allows you to be flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>Schema mutation in Logality happens through <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> and <a href="#serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers</a>, both of which we touch on below.</p>



<p>Logality will take care of all your metadata needs so you won’t need to log any additional information. In particular, Logality will automatically resolve and log for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The location of the file where the log originated from.</li>
  <li>The hostname of the machine that runs the application.</li>
  <li>The process id.</li>
  <li>The process name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple <code>log.info('hello world')</code> log will produce the following log message (expanded):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"severity"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"level"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"info"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"dt"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-05-18T16:25:57.815Z"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello world"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"runtime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"application"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"testLogality"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"file_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/test/spec/surface.test.js"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"system"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"hostname"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"pid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>36255</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"process_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node ."</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the use of <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> you can create and attach your own metadata on each one of your log messages.</p>

<h2 id="serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers of Data Objects</h2>

<p>As standardization of logging data is a primary requirement for Logality, serializers were introduced to solve the problem of consistently logging known data objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example the User Data Object (UDO) and the action of logging in, you could log the event as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>`User </span><span>${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>}</span><span> logged in`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that is not a JSON log message, that is a string log message and it is not easily query-able. Let’s try this again with Logality’s JSON logging feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>User logged in</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>user</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we passed the UDO to logality, however, Logality has no instruction of what portions of the UDO we want logged and here is where serializers come in. Serializers are simple functions that take the objects that you pass as input and output the properties that you want to have logged.</p>

<p>This way, you standardize how your models are logged across your infrastructure and protect your system from logging sensitive fields like a user’s password or unnecessary information like meta data of a product.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-middleware">The Power of Middleware</h2>

<p>Logality introduces middleware which allows you to manipulate and mutate the logging messages as you see fit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>((</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Remove user data object from logging</span>
    <span>delete</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Add debugging flag on all messages</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>debug</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Middleware, you can create powerful data flows, augmenting log messages as they come in with rich metadata information collected from the environment and runtime.</p>

<p>You can also have conditional transformations of the data that pass through logality for absolute control over the data flows and your compliance requirements.</p>

<h2 id="linking-multiple-logality-instances">Linking Multiple Logality Instances</h2>

<p>As an open source contributor, one of the biggest problems I have been challenged with is how to log on open source libraries. If you want to have logging on your library you are challenged with quite a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide an option to turn off logging.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to filter the logging level.</li>
  <li>How do you format the logs according to your downstream application’s standards?</li>
  <li>Should you log to stdout, an event or a function?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very challenging problems, to the point where no practical solution exists. Until today that is, as Logality introduces piping. You can pipe one Logality instance into another and have all the middleware functions handle the piped logality’s log messages. When Logality is piped, the log messages get passed as pure data objects so that the downstream consuming function can properly parse and manipulate them.</p>

<p>This is huge as it enables your application to granularly control how much information is logged from the libraries you are using. And at the same time have your third-party libraries log in the exact same format-schema that your entire infrastructure is logging. Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>Piping happens simply by providing the child Logality instance to the parent’s <code>pipe()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>thirdPartyLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>thirdparty</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>applicationLogality</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>thirdPartyLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>logality</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="custom-output-and-pretty-print">Custom Output and Pretty Print</h2>

<p>Finally, after all the processing the log message has gone through, you can control how the final serialization and output is handled. By default Logality will JSON serialize and output to stdout but you may have other plans.</p>

<p>This operation also enables you to filter certain log messages based on your custom criteria. This is particularly useful when managing multiple log streams from various upstreams (third-party libraries) that are piping their logs to your main application Logality logger.</p>

<p>Logality also offers a built-in pretty print functionality that, as the word suggests, will print the log messages in a human readable format, with nice colors, emojis and all. This is particularly useful when you are developing the application and don’t want to see JSON serialized log messages.</p>

<h3 id="outline-of-logalitys-lifecycle-and-piping">Outline of Logality’s Lifecycle and Piping</h3>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/logality-lifecycle-outline.svg" alt="Logality Lifecycle Outline"></p>

<h2 id="synchronous-or-asynchronous">Synchronous or Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>With a flick of a switch you can have Logality become asynchronous and reveal its Promise API. When in async mode, Logality’s Middleware and Custom Output functions will be able to handle a promise and allow you to capture log messages en-route.</p>

<p>Say you want to push all log messages to a queue, or for any reason, you want to store some, or all, of the log messages into your database. By enabling async mode on Logality you can easily and safely perform those tasks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Security middleware for logality, store the log message</span>
<span>// in our database as well and send it to our queue for</span>
<span>// further processing and alerting</span>
<span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>security</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>// login failed, log it</span>
<span>await</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Login Failed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>security</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you rightfully observed, when async mode is enabled Logality’s logging is, well, async, and thus returns a promise that needs to be resolved. Therefore, that is why you see the <code>await</code> before the <code>log.warn()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>Personally, my use case for using async mode and secondary data stores <a href="https://srop.co/" title="SROP The Secure Drop">at SROP</a> was for auditing log trails. When an audit log event occurred, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cross-compiling self-contained Java desktop application launchers.</p><h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2><p>Java’s promise of <em>write once, run anywhere</em> still resonates with me, perhaps because I cut my teeth on JDK 1.0.2b. It was amazing to write cross-platform networking applications without concern for variations in POSIX implementations, or having to worry about nuances between C compilers, or even needing to grok <code>htons</code>. Someone else could wrestle with <code>#ifdef</code>s, shielding others by high-level, standard abstractions. Although Smalltalk had concocted platform-independence punch in 1983, it wasn’t until 1996 that Java’s virtual machine (VM) and subsequent OEM distributions made drinking the mantra of cross-platform development an easy reality.</p><p>Strategically—and selfishly—Microsoft smote that future with a sledgehammer: it moved to <em>embrace and extend</em> Java to achieve vendor lock-in, splintering the platform.</p><p>Developers can no longer rely on systems having a Java VM available. This implies that end-users must download (and install) two independent programs: a suitable VM and a Java archive. It also means that developers now have choices ahead of them that were once bygone worries. Choices that burden end-users and developers alike. Asking people to download a VM for their operating system and CPU architecture is a barrier to product adoption. What’s worse is that some VMs now support “full” Java while others don’t support JavaFX modules at all.</p><p>We’ll address that last point later.</p><p>In late 2019, <a href="https://github.com/kevinrushforth">Kevin Rushforth</a>, of Oracle’s Java Team, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZGW9AalZLN4?t=504">presented</a> a solution to the packaging problem: <code>jpackage</code> and <code>jlink</code>. During the presentation he listed some of the tooling’s shortcomings, which include:</p><ul><li>No cross-platform deployment</li><li>No cross-compilation (must run on MacOS to produce <code>.dmg</code>)</li></ul><p>Let’s not mince words: Java developers could once build applications on their preferred operating system and deploy anywhere; now, they must build installers for every individual platform they intend to target on those very systems.</p><p>Was that the <em>punch-line</em> to a two-decade lead up?</p><p>Requiring developers to have at least two commercial operating systems (Windows, MacOS X), even if emulated inside of a virtualized container—as opposed to using physical hardware—for a platform-independent programming language is an ironic barrier to entry. <em>Especially</em> for people bereft of bankroll.</p><p>Yes, those tools—alongside modules—help produce minimal executables. Who cares? What they don’t do is make it possible to create a set of native, standalone launcher binaries from a single build machine. Let’s fix that by pouring over the big splashes of how to cross-compile application launchers for Java on one build machine. We’ll use Linux because it’s free.</p><h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2><p>You will need:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dgiagio/warp">Warp Packer</a>, a tool for building native application launchers</li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, a source code management tool</li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>, a tool for fetching files</li><li><a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> version 6.4.1, a build system</li><li><a href="https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog/2020/06/29/write-once-build-anywhere/build-template">build-template</a>, my own starter shell script (MIT licensed)</li></ul><p>Install <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code> using the package manager for your Linux distro.</p><h3 id="install-warp-packer">Install Warp Packer</h3><p>The installation instructions for Warp Packer are a bit buried. Install the software on a Linux system as follows (change the version number to suit):</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cd $HOME/bin
wget -O warp-packer \
  https://github.com/dgiagio/warp/releases/download/v0.3.0/linux-x64.warp-packer
chmod +x warp-packer</code></pre><p>If needed, include <code>$HOME/bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable by adding the following line to <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>:</p><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"</code></pre><p>Apply the new environment settings by opening a new terminal or <code>source</code>’ing the <code>.bashrc</code> file directly.</p><p>Warp Packer is installed.</p><h3 id="install-build-template">Install Build Template</h3><p>Copy, move, or download <code>build-template</code> into <code>$HOME/bin</code>.</p><p>The build template is installed.</p><h2 id="javafx">JavaFX</h2><p>Before we get into building a Java application, a little more history is warranted. Originally, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) came bundled with Java, for the same reasons that having a bundled networking API was useful. The AWT lacked aesthetic, both in appearance and as a library. Swing, the AWT’s successor, made strides to address both, but fell short. JavaFX, which was also initially bundled with Java (versions 8 to 10), is a modern graphical user interface (GUI) library for developing desktop applications, as well as a superb replacement for Swing.</p><p>It has been argued that JavaFX should never have been bundled with Java. Nevertheless, the decision to un-bundle JavaFX from Java 11 onwards has led to Java projects that will be stuck with old Java versions for years to come—possibly leading to their abandonment—because it takes <em>a lot</em> of effort to migrate a build process to support these new, un-bundled Java Development Kits (JDKs).</p><p>Part of that effort entails re-bundling JavaFX. There are a few ways this can be accomplished:</p><ul><li>Create a single <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947093/59087">überjar</a></em> that contains native libraries for all intended platform targets.</li><li>Create separate <em>überjars</em>, with each JAR containing native libraries specific to its target platform.</li></ul><p>It’s almost a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice">Hobson’s choice</a> because we have to create launcher binaries for each target platform anyway. Meaning bundling all of the target platform libraries into each native launcher is wasteful; however, bundling them in a single JAR file for those who have a Java VM installed already may be somewhat useful.</p><p>Java has introduced the concept of modules, looking to simplify the build process. Sometimes, though, modules cannot be included because of outdated dependencies. Problems can arise when running <code>jlink</code> against old dependencies. Compounding the issue is when the projects have been sundowned or have long release schedules. Nevertheless, for our purposes, we’ll want to download a version of OpenJDK that supports JavaFX.</p><p>With that background in mind, let’s go cross-compile some binaries.</p><h2 id="java-application">Java Application</h2><p>We’ll create native application launchers for <a href="https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/">Scrivenvar</a>, a JavaFX-based text editor that I’ve been developing.</p><p>Dive in by cloning the latest version as follows:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/dev
cd $HOME/dev
git clone https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar.git
cd scrivenvar</code></pre><p>The application is downloaded.</p><h2 id="build-scripts">Build Scripts</h2><p>Let’s review the scripts that help build the application, which include:</p><ul><li><code>build.gradle</code> — builds application Java Archive (JAR) files</li><li><code>installer</code> — builds native, standalone binaries</li></ul><p>Separating the <code>installer</code> script’s responsibilities from <code>build.gradle</code> is not necessary, technically. When running third-party executables (e.g., <code>warp-packer</code>), my first inclination is to use a shell script, rather than gradle’s <code>exec</code>.</p><p>The <code>installer</code> script invokes <code>gradle</code> when requested.</p><h2 id="gradle-script">Gradle Script</h2><p>Open up <code>build.gradle</code> to review a few pertinent code blocks.</p><h3 id="target-operating-system">Target Operating System</h3><p>The first snippet determines what native JavaFX libraries (i.e., target platform code) to include within the JAR file:</p><pre><code>String[] os = ["win", "mac", "linux"]

if (project.hasProperty('targetOs')) {
  if ("windows".equals(targetOs)) {
    os = ["win"]
  }
  else {
    os = [targetOs]
  }
}</code></pre><p>Unless instructed otherwise, the build script will create a JAR file that includes JavaFX binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS embedded. We can target a specific platform by using the <code>-P</code> command line option when building, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build jar -PtargetOs=linux</code></pre><p>There’s a catch here in that <code>win</code> and <code>windows</code> are different names. The <code>installer</code> script needs to use <code>windows</code> because that’s part of the JDK file name being downloaded. Arguably, we could move that logic into the <code>installer</code> script, but the point is that the JDK filename and JavaFX refer to Windows using different terminology. The difference must be captured somwhere.</p><h3 id="javafx-dependencies">JavaFX Dependencies</h3><p>The second snippet tells the build system to include JavaFX for a given set of operating systems, as follows:</p><pre><code>def fx = ['controls', 'graphics', 'fxml', 'swing']

fx.each { fxitem -&gt;
  os.each { ositem -&gt;
    runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:javafx-${fxitem}:${javafx.version}:${ositem}"
  }
}</code></pre><p>The application uses JavaFX controls, graphics, fxml, and notice that it also lists a JavaFX-Swing integration. Using <code>.each</code> is a tidy way of not having to maintain a list of JavaFX-specific imports for each operating system, should either or both need to change.</p><h3 id="javafx-exclusions">JavaFX Exclusions</h3><p>Of lesser importance are exclude groups:</p><pre><code>implementation('de.jensd:fontawesomefx-fontawesome:4.7.0-11') {
  exclude group: 'org.openjfx'
}</code></pre><p>Without excluding JavaFX from certain JavaFX-related dependencies, the build will fail. Unfortunately, the build fails in such a way that the developer must investigate what package caused the conflict. Ideally, the build failure would pinpoint any collisions for the developer.</p><h3 id="run-application">Run Application</h3><p>The last point of note are the following lines:</p><pre><code>applicationDefaultJvmArgs = [
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control.skin=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED",
]</code></pre><p>These lines address permissions issues encountered when running the application using gradle, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build run</code></pre><p>Now that we understand how this build script works, let’s move on to the <code>installer</code> shell script.</p><h2 id="installer-script">Installer Script</h2><p>Looking at the big picture, the <code>installer</code> script performs the following steps to create a native launcher binary:</p><ol type="1"><li>Configure platform-specific parameters for extraction.</li><li>Rebuild the <em>überjar</em> for the target platform.</li><li>Clean out the distribution directory for a fresh build.</li><li>Extract the target JDK into the distribution directory.</li><li>Create a platform-dependent launch script to run the application.</li><li>Copy the <em>überjar</em> into the distribution directory.</li><li>Wrap the distribution into a standalone binary.</li></ol><p>These high-level steps can be found in the <code>execute()</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at how the script works.</p><h3 id="build-template">Build Template</h3><p>The <code>build-template</code> script is described in depth in the first three parts of my Typesetting Markdown series. We reuse the script here because it simplifies writing user-friendly shell scripts.</p><p>Downloading and extracting a requisite JDK is pivotal. JDKs can be downloaded from a few places, but most of them have …</p></article></div>

This issue is independent of the quality of the video, the FPS, or the internet connection. Trying to watch certain videos will reliably cause playback issues on the Chromecast.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879">this thread</a>, the playback issue only appeared in the latest and final firmware update for the Chromecast. Successful playback of the videos was possible in the past, and casting the downloaded YouTube videos eliminates the problem entirely. The problem exists solely when casting certain videos using the YouTube app.</p>  <p>Given that the problem only occurs with the YouTube app, you can download a video and cast it via <a href="https://github.com/xat/castnow"><code>castnow</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt"><code>catt</code></a>, skipping the YouTube app entirely.</p> <p>You could do something like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

This method is both efficient and concurrent, making this primitive an apt choice to build a solution to the problem at hand. A process reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> blocks until the pipe is opened by another process for writing. A process writing to the pipe will suspend until the pipe’s buffer is read by another process. The anonymous pipe will automatically remove itself, and when it is manually removed, its dependent processes will be terminated.</p> <p>When using process substitution, a process’ <code>stdout</code> is hooked up to an anonymous pipe. That pipe can be accessed from a file descriptor, and the location of the pipe is given to the calling process.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
/dev/fd/63

<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
Content sent to pipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the example above, the <code>&lt;(command)</code> syntax is how we invoke process substitution in Bash. The output of <code>command</code> is written to an anonymous pipe, and the calling process is given the location of the file descriptor to access that pipe.</p> <p>Using that example, we can take advantage of process substitution:</p> <div><div><pre><code>vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The command above will play the YouTube video locally with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, and illustrates that process substitution can work for our use case.</p> <p>However, when we try to use <code>castnow</code>, we can’t cast from the pipe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>castnow &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: Load failed
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Nor can we cast with <code>catt</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>catt cast &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: The chosen file does not exist.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We know we can use VLC locally, and VLC also lets you cast to a Chromecast using its IP address.</p> <p>Let’s try that again using VLC:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_vlc<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span># get the ip address for chromecast.lan host</span>
    <span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>dig +short chromecast.lan | <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1<span>)</span>

    vlc <span>-I</span> ncurses <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout</span> <span>'#chromecast'</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout-chromecast-ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$ip</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--demux-filter</span><span>=</span>demux_chromecast <span>\</span>
      <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &lt; /dev/tty
<span>}</span>

cast_vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That works.</p> <p>As an aside, we hook VLC’s <code>stdin</code> to <code>/dev/tty</code> so that we can use the ncurses interface even if we invoke the function from a script.</p> <p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/ncurses/">ncurses interface</a>.</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0822203c304db88f3cbec618e94a3d9f55cd269/c5939/assets/imgs/converted/vlc-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div> <p>It only displays the file descriptor, and very little about the video itself. I’m not a fan of that.</p>  <p>Instead of using anonymous pipes, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe">named pipes</a>. Named pipes are like anonymous pipes, except they are not anonymous (they have a name) nor are they ephemeral. Named pipes still give us the efficiency and concurrency benefits that anonymous pipes give us, but Bash lacks the syntactic sugar it has for process substitution when it comes to named pipes.</p> <p>This is how we create named pipes, write to them, read from them and remove them.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkfifo </span>ourpipe

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Not as pretty as <code>&lt;(command)</code>, but it gets the job done.</p> <p>We can give a named pipe the same name as our YouTube video, and that way, the VLC interface will show the name of what we’re watching.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_ytdl<span>()</span> <span>{</span>

cast_ytdl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This works, too.</p> <p>We need to manually create a named pipe with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkfifo"><code>mkfifo</code></a>, redirect <code>youtube-dl</code>’s <code>stdout</code> to the named pipe while running the process in the background, and then cleanup the process after casting from it via VLC, otherwise it might linger in the background. Each of those tasks would have been handled for us automatically using process substitution.</p> <p>But it does look a bit better:</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25d68fb2085191adb26bb931e9bb31c638e5a634/f664c/assets/imgs/converted/vlc3-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div>  <p>Pipes, anonymous pipes and named pipes are also known by another name because of the way they behave: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)#Pipes">FIFOs</a>, or <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>i</strong>n, <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>o</strong>ut. What’s written to the pipe is read from the pipe in first in, first out order. This behavior maps well to video streaming.</p> <p>While you can interact with anonymous and named pipes like you would a file, the interface isn’t 1:1 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file">standard file</a>. You cannot <code>seek()</code> forward or backward in pipe, you can just read the next forward values. For our use case, that means we cannot skip forward or backward in our streaming videos. We can only play, pause or stop the video.</p> <p>That’s not a problem for me, however it’s something that can be mitigated if it’s a problem for you. The first solution I can think of would be to write to a temporary file via <code>youtube-dl</code> and read from it. Or <a href="https://alexdelorenzo.dev/programming/2019/04/14/buffer">perhaps a temporary spooled file can act as a buffer for the pipe</a>, such that you can <code>seek()</code> through the buffer, but the buffer itself is ephemeral unlike a normal file.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/dCcLQ5TLFANMj0p3Uh/giphy.gif" alt="Press F to pay respects"></p>
<p>For a year or so I have owned a nice fake-vintage radio/bluetooth speaker that originally caught my eye for sale in a FedEx office. The front has a quite nice VFD-style LED to show the status, a volume knob and four hard buttons. It has Bluetooth, USB, AUX and FM input. The radio and bluetooth was not bad, but there was nothing to be impressed about. It was definitely not "smart."</p>
<p>I decided to hack it to make it a bit smarter: to do AirPlay and be a smart alarm clock and whatever else I could think of. Since it was inexpensive, I had nothing to lose and everything to win. I thought putting a Raspberry Pi 0 or something in it would be nice.</p>
<p>My original plan was to somehow figure out how to hijack all the external components and control them to make the front and back of the radio as neat-looking as possible. At least I hoped to hijack the speaker, the volume knob, and the buttons. The problem I foresaw was that those components are often not documented and there was little chance that I could get a datasheet for them. I was very worried that I might have to give up the fake-VFD LED screen.</p>
<p>It turns out that I had to spend a year hacking it on and off. Here goes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/fedex-sale.jpg" alt="FedEx sale"></p>
<p>First, I gutted the radio and saw that it has a main PCB with the LED panel directly soldered to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/radio-disassembled.jpg" alt="Disassembled radio"></p>
<p>The chip on the PCB isn't something I recognized. Luckily, the knob and the hard buttons are on a separate breakout board and are connected to the mainboard via a connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/main-pcb.jpg" alt="Main PCB"></p>
<h2 id="the-speaker">The speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is also easy to deal with, as it is completely ordinary. It only required me to desolder it from the mainboard. As the Pi 0 has no built-in soundcard, I had to get a separate sound card for it.</p>
<h3 id="audio-injector-zero">Audio Injector Zero</h3>
<p>Initially, I used the Audio Injector Zero that I have no use for normally. To save space, I decided to permanently sandwich the Audio Injector to the Pi 0. I also had to buy a cheap amp for it, as the sound card can't directly drive the speaker.</p>
<p>One little issue was that the sound card produces stereo input, and the amp is also stereo, but I only have one speaker. I needed to mix both channels left and right to that speaker somehow. To that end, I am sure a Linux guru could make it work with configuring the sound card in software. However, I am not extremely well-versed with how ALSA or Pulse Audio works. I just wired both channels left and right of the amp to one channel input of the amp to mix the channels. For power, the amp needs 5V input, so I siphoned the two power pins from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>I was surprised when the amp produced a very annoying hum. The hum was extremely noticeable when the Pi is under load. I don't know exactly why this happens, but I spent way too much time on this with no significant improvement. Ultimately, I decided it's the cheap amp that was giving me a hard time, because it was way too noisy. I know the Audio Injector itself was okay because the headphones output was clean.</p>
<h3 id="google-aiy-voice-hat">Google AIY voice hat</h3>
<p>After giving up on the Audio Injector Zero + Amp solution, I tried a different route: Drive the speaker directly with the Google AIY voice bonnet hat. Because the Google AIY sound card doesn't provide an easy way to set up on a plain raspbian, I just got their distro and started from there.</p>
<p>The speaker was hum-free after switching to the Google AIY soundcard. The tradeoff was that the Google Voice Bonnet V2 sound card made the stack quite a bit thicker. It has a female row of pins soldered on it, so I couldn't solder it directly on top of the Pi Zero.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/sound-cards.jpg" alt="Sound cards"></p>

<p>The front panel of the radio has two sets of elements: A knob of some sort to control the volume and four hard buttons. It has four wires hanging out of it. After I inspected the traces on the PCB, it was apparent that there is one common ground. The three other pins are for the buttons and the knob. All of the buttons are connected to a single pin, and the volume knob is connected to the other two.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/buttons-knob.jpg" alt="Buttons and knobs"></p>
<p>As a software person, I didn't know what the knob is called. <a href="http://dbindner.freeshell.org/">Dr. Don Bindner</a> suggested that the button might be a rotary encoder, and that turned out to be true. It seemed <a href="http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Rotary-encoder-circuit.php">trivial enough to read the knob</a>.</p>
<p>The buttons are more interesting. After poking around with a multimeter, it turned out that the buttons were tactile but each of them is connected in series to a different resistor. Then they all connect out to the same pin. The software in the chip scans the pin and figures out what button was pressed by sampling from an Analog-to-Digital (ADC) Converter reading. As the Pi has no ADC, we need something else that has an ADC to figure out what the button was pressed. Of course, I could as well hijack the tactile buttons and not have to deal with the ADC stuff but that seemed too aesthetically unpleasant for me.</p>
<p>I decided to pull out anArduino Pro Micro clone that I bought from China years ago. My reasoning for using the Pro Micro:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Arduino Pro Micro is super cheap: $2 cheap.</li>
<li>Even if I could add an ADC to the Pi, I need to continuously read the ADC from the Pi. That is a pain in the neck. I can't guarantee the timings on the Pi without going to a lot of care.</li>
<li>The Pro Micro can emulate a keyboard over USB, so the Pi can use triggerhappy to catch it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So with that, I made my arduino sketch and it worked out. I wanted to emulate the Winamp-style buttons ZXCV for multimedia keys and UD for volume up/down. Later on, I was quite annoyed with it because the keyboard dumps the keystrokes to the terminal, and <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/very-odd-bug-found-in-jailbreaking-process-20081109/">it could be bad</a>. I decided to implement the keys as multimedia keys. Unfortunately, you need a HID library to implement multimedia keys. Luckily, there is a library called <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HID">HID-Project</a> to achieve exactly what I wanted. After some tweakings for debounce, I could get the volume knob and the buttons to work exactly as I expected:</p>

<p>I could test the Arduino implementation right on my development computer with <code>xev</code> so that was really nice.</p>
<h2 id="the-fake-vfd-led-screen">The fake VFD LED screen</h2>
<p>The screen was the part that I had the most doubt about being able to control, because I have never worked with such a device before. Before trying to reverse-engineer it, I tried to look up similar 7-segment LED screens online hoping to find something similar. Those screens often have more than 8 pins (1 for the ground, 7 for each segment, and some more to select the digit. This one is nothing like that: It has only 7 pins. I wanted to give it up and just buy another screen that has a datasheet to save myself from trouble but I couldn't find anything that would fit into the original cutout for the screen. So I had to bite the bullet and hack the LED screen (I had nothing better to do in the craziness of the pandemic).</p>
<h3 id="general-workings">General workings</h3>
<p>There was no giveaway from the PCB what the ground pin for the display might be. I only had a multimeter in hand so what I did was set it to the diode tester mode. Then I probed pairs of pins to see what lights up. As luck would have it, I found out that each pair of pins lit up a different segment on the screen. So there was no common ground at all! I drew the screen and noted what pin pair light up each segment (excuse my nasty draft paper):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/matrix-draft.jpg" alt="Draft Matrix"></p>
<p>First, I was really annoyed because the screen is yet another custom device I had to reverse engineer. Then, it really impressed me that this screen is quite well designed for such a cheap device. There were exactly 42 segments on this LED screen! The number of different segments is exactly the maximum number of permutations between any 2 pins: P(7,2) = 42. After some more digging, I found out that this wiring scheme is called <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/charlieplexing/">Charlieplexing</a>. So each LED segment has a voltage drop of 1.860V, and my Arduino is 5V. I assumed a 20mA current and used a LED calculator and to figure out that I need to connect a 150K resistor to the LED. Because of the charlieplexing setup, I actually need half of that resistance for each pin (it will be apparent as you read on), so I soldered a 68K resistor to each pin.</p>
<h3 id="control-the-led-screen-programmatically">Control the LED screen programmatically</h3>
<p>The question then became how to control this LED screen programmatically. It was clear to me I can't possibly draw every segment by toggling the pins on and off in one whole sweep. Then I realized that I need to think of the LED screen like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r38nVmxBfvM">analog TV screen</a>. Thus, each of the pins can be thought of as a horizontal scanline – except they are not on the same “line”! This might be quite obvious to those who have dealt with CRTs in the past (which I have not), but it might be hard to imagine for those who grew up with LCDs.</p>
<p>Let's say I want to draw the screen with segment 17, 18, and 11 lit up. That means I have to do two sweeps. First, pull pin 1 to GND and pull pin 2 to V_LED to light up segment 18. Then, pull pin 4 to GND and pull pin 1 and 7 to V_LED to light up segment 17 and 11 at once. Do it fast enough, and my eyes won't be able to tell we are flashing them!</p></div></div>

        <p>Local economies around the U.S. have continued to change quickly and dramatically – states and cities are slowly reopening, unemployment rates are starting to decline from the recent all-time high, COVID-19 cases are increasing in some states while decreasing in others, and communities are responding to the social unrest and George Floyd protests with city-wide curfews having impacted many businesses that were just able to reopen.</p>
        <p>Yelp last reported on the state of the local economy in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html">our quarterly Yelp Economic Average report on April 28</a>, showing how much consumer activity in major swathes of Main Street had dropped off in just a couple of weeks in March. Now as states start to reopen and the nation responds to anti-Black racism and police brutality, a new set of challenges lay ahead for local economies.</p>

      <h2>Some Businesses Slowly Reopen, While Many Permanently Close</h2>
        <p>As of June 15, there were nearly 140,000 total business closures on Yelp since March 1. In April we reported more than 175,000 business closures, indicating that more than 20% of businesses closed in April have reopened. Las Vegas, NV, endured the highest number of closures relative to the number of businesses in the city (1,921 total closures), while Los Angeles, CA, had the largest total number of closures (11,774 total closures).</p>

        <p>Of all business closures on Yelp since March 1, 41% are permanent closures. Our data shows the largest spikes of permanent closures occurred in March, followed by May and June, indicating that the businesses that were already struggling had to permanently close right away and the businesses that were trying to hold on, but unable to weather the COVID-19 storm, were forced to shutter in recent months.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Retail and Restaurant Businesses Continue Innovating Amid High Closure Rates</h2>
        <p>While many business sectors have struggled during COVID-19 there are a few industries that have endured especially high closure rates. Among those with the highest rate of business closures are shopping and retail (27,663 closed businesses), restaurants (23,981 closed businesses), beauty (15,348 closed businesses) and fitness (5,589 closed businesses).</p>
        <p>Retail was by far the hardest hit, experiencing the highest number of total closures, with the average daily rate continuing to increase since March. Of all closures on Yelp since March 1, 20% are for retail businesses and 35% of closed retail businesses are indicated as permanent on Yelp.</p>
        <p>In March, Restaurants had the highest number of business closures, compared to other industries, and have continued to close at high rates. Of the businesses that closed, 17% are restaurants, and 53% of those restaurant closures are indicated as permanent on Yelp. Restaurants run on thin margins and can sometimes take months or even years to break even, resulting in this higher rate of permanent closures.</p>

Many restaurants pivoted to offering takeout and delivery, while some experimented with take home meal and drink kits, and even virtual cooking classes. Some are finding new ways to use existing technology, like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/04/use-waitlist-online-takeout-restaurants?utm_source=biz_blog&amp;utm_medium=yelp_blog&amp;utm_content=blog_text_link">Yelp Waitlist to manage curbside pickup</a>. Servicing food to-go produces high margins for restaurants, and we’ve seen a 10X increase in searches for takeout since March 10.</p>
        <p>With many retail businesses shifting to curbside pickup, we’ve seen consumer interest spike in obtaining their goods in this way with a 20% increase in searches for curbside pickup. In the beauty industry we’ve seen hair stylists offering video hair cutting tutorials, estheticians offering virtual consultations, and small shops shifting their focus to ecommerce. Fitness in particular has seen a significant shift in their business model with gyms and studios offering virtual classes and personal trainers offering one-on-one virtual training sessions. If nothing else, local businesses owners have proven themselves to be resilient and creative during these trying times.</p>

      <h2>The Desire to Support Black-Owned Businesses Continues to Grow</h2>
        <p>As acknowledgement of anti-Black racism and police brutality become more wide-spread across the nation people are continuing to look for ways to support the Black community. Since May 25, we’ve seen a 1785% relative increase in searches for Black-owned businesses, compared to the three weeks prior. Review mentions of “Black-owned” (and related terms) also skyrocketed, up 426%, as people look to support and surface these businesses to the community.</p>
        <p>D.C. had the highest number of Black-owned searches, accounting for nearly 1% of all searches on Yelp, followed by Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan and Georgia. In fact, every state has shown an increase in searches for Black-owned businesses. Looking at metros, Ann Arbor, MI has the highest increase in searches for Black-owned, up 105X (accounting for 3% of all searches), followed by Denver (up 27X), Minneapolis (up 23X) and Baltimore (up 19X).</p>

      <h2>The Recovering Economy May Look Different Than the Old Economy</h2>
        <p>While some normal activity is starting to bounce back, due to the many changes impacting local economies — state rules, consumer behavior, and social unrest — many of the consumer interest shifts we saw in March and April started to rebound in May, with dramatic shifts in June.</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities that became popular at the height of the pandemic as people were finding ways to stay active while social distancing – such as mountain biking (down 40%), lakes (down 34%), golf (down 33%) and hiking (down 28%) – have dropped in consumer interest since May 1 relative to other active activities. People are starting to feel more comfortable participating in indoor activities, with increased consumer interest for escape games (up 182%), Go Karts (up 147%), axe throwing (up 113%), gyms (up 81%), bowling (up 63%) and yoga (42%). That said, in some instances people are still finding ways to stay outdoors while social distancing with an increased interest in mini golf (up 132%), amusement parks (up 28%) and horseback riding (up 21%).</p>
        <p>The previous spike in community supported agriculture and grocery has started to dip (down 54% and 26%, respectively) as people start heading back into restaurants. In fact, Yelp’s diners seated data shows significantly more people are dining-in at restaurants. During the peak of the pandemic, the number of diners seated across Yelp Reservations and Waitlist dropped essentially to zero. In early June, we've seen diners seated come back substantially – now down 57% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that cater to group dining are among those making a comeback – fondue (up 123%), tapas bars (up 98%), hot pot (up 49%) and surprisingly, even buffets (up 17%) – as foods that gained increased interest through takeout and delivery have started to fall – pizza (down 28%), chinese (down 26%), fast food (down 18%). That said, takeout and delivery has continued to sustain interest on Yelp, still up 148% based on consumer interest relative to pre-pandemic levels, indicating this could be a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
        <p>People are also headed back into malls with outlet stores, shopping centers and thrift stores all up (up 84%, 81%, 72%, respectively), as well as hosting or attending formal events with increased interest in bridal (up 70%) and formal wear (up 102%). The previous increase in cannabis dispensaries, head shops and tobacco shops has declined (down 40%, 35% and 32%, respectively). There have also been significant shifts in consumer interest for health and wellness businesses with an increased interest in saunas (up 75%), reflexology (up 69%) and dentists (up 28%), while skilled nursing (down 46%) and hospitals (down 37%) decline.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The finance world is quickly entering the mainstream —</p><p>Every month a notable company goes public. Every week a hot startup raises millions of dollars. And every day moms, pops, and teens check on their stocks. </p><p>Whether a company builds rocket engines or mobile apps, they tell their story using the same language —&nbsp;financial statements. Here's how they work.</p><p>Let's say you run a subscription t-shirt business.</p><p>It's going well — you have happy customers and healthy profit. You're thinking of buying your own factory to make more t-shirts, more quickly, and more cheaply.</p><p>There's just one problem — you can't afford a factory.</p><p>So, you ask the bank for a loan. Your company is profitable and the factory will pay for itself in 3 years, so you know you'll be able to pay it back. But while you know this, the bank doesn't — you'll need to convince them. The bank, however, doesn't know anything about the subscription clothing business.</p><p>To get on the same page, you need a shared language for talking about your business.</p><p><h4 id="heading-1">Double-entry Bookkeeping: The birth of accounting</h4></p><p>Double-entry bookkeeping was the first formalism in finance. The Middle East had it in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697986" target="_blank">first century AD</a>, Korea independently got it in the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1598-2661" target="_blank">11th century</a>, and by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232023/http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778" target="_blank">1500s</a>, it had been well-documented across Europe.</p><p>It's a simple concept designed to reduce errors when documenting transactions: every entry to an "account" requires an equal and opposite entry to another "account".</p><p>If you bought some cotton to turn into t-shirts, you might record the transaction like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-371c827e421c-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde0379b53032713cde77_bookkeeping.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>When you spend $100 on cotton, your "Cash" account gets debited (loses) $100, and your "Materials" account gets credited (gains) $100. The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>. You don't keep all of it — there are costs and expenses along the way — so you need to subtract these. The final number you end up with is your <strong>Profit</strong> — the money you've made at the end of the day.</p><p>Here's how you might do the calculation:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a4e76259fbb4-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe0c6c8f0be2b6743533b_p%26l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>You start at Revenue (the top line), subtract your costs, and end up at Profit (the "bottom line" — get it?). This is a simple <strong>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</strong>, or <strong>Income Statement</strong>. Most companies make one every month, to keep an eye on things. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fec0fade16bf-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe17879b5309ce33ce18b_35274025-14536291245349646_origin.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>With a P&amp;L, you and the bank can understand what's going in and out of your business. If your P&amp;L consistently shows a profit, then the bank will be happy, and so will you.</p><p>In theory, this is very simple. But in practice, each P&amp;L item has hidden nuances to address.</p><p>Let's take just the top line — what does <strong>Revenue</strong> actually mean?</p><p><strong>What is revenue?</strong></p><p>When you started selling shirts, it was a simpler time — you bought them in bulk from China and sold them at the local market.</p><p>Revenue, too, was simple — it was the cold hard cash in your hand.</p><p>But things changed. You started taking bulk orders from shops, who pay you 1 month after you deliver the shirts. And when you went online, your customers started paying you for 12 month subscriptions, all in one go.</p><p>It turns out that if you keep thinking of revenue as "cash in your hand", then things get a little weird —</p><ul role="list"><li>When you get a bulk order, your expenses shoot up. But since you don't get paid until next month, your profit goes way down this month.</li><li>When someone buys a 12-month subscription, your revenue spikes up. But for the next 11 months you have to keep delivering on the order (non-zero cost) without further payments (zero revenue) — your bottom line takes a hit.</li></ul><p>Bulk orders and upfront payments are great for your business, but if revenue means "cash in hand", then your P&amp;L might tell the opposite story.</p><p>A better way to think about revenue is as "the value of products delivered or service provided".</p><p>In each month of a subscription, you do 1 month of work. So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time. The bank, however, remains unsatisfied.</p><p>Sadly, consistent profits, measured with accrual accounting, can still leave you penniless on payday.</p><p><h4 id="heading-4">Financial Statement #3: The Cashflow Statement</h4></p><p>In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had a dilemma.</p><p>On paper, things were great — they'd recovered from a downturn and were posting healthy profits. To smelt more iron, they set out to buy a new blast furnace. But despite their promising P&amp;L, it turned out that they had no cash to buy it.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Their problem was in spending cash too quickly — as soon as they got some, they'd use it on inventory (iron ore, etc). The profits were rolling in, but the cash wasn't sticking around.</p><p>The company needed a way to understand how cash was coming in and out — the cashflow. Their solution was the origin of the modern <strong>Cashflow Statement</strong>.</p><p>Like the P&amp;L, the cashflow statement shows how things change over each month, but crucially, it only focuses on cash — how much you started with, what you spent it on, where you got more of it, and how much you ended up with. In short, the cashflow statement explains the difference between one balance sheet and the next.</p><figure id="w-node-508193268673-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe644e9cf27ec56e99c29_Untitled-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bank should now have enough information to decide whether to give you a loan:</p><ul role="list"><li>Balance Sheet — shows everything that you own, and everything that you owe</li><li>P&amp;L/Income Statement — shows how your business operates</li><li>Cashflow Statement — shows how you spend and earn cash</li></ul><p>These financial statements are a shared language, letting businesses communicate across industries and borders.

<p>It's no secret that finishing a side project is hard.</p>
<p>I've struggled with some side projects and had success with others. In this post, I'll focus on the actions and adjustments that have worked for me.</p>
<p>It's possible to work on and finish side projects even with a busy schedule, the key is to optimize for interruptability. You will be interrupted so instead of counting on having hours of deep work available, it's better to be realistic and make some adjustments to use available time in a better way and reducing the cost of interruptions by having tricks to switch context fast.</p>
<h2 id="a-failed-side-project-story">A failed side project story <a href="#a-failed-side-project-story">#</a></h2>
<p>Maybe you are familiar with a similar situation</p>
<p>At the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>High motivation.</li>
<li>Priority over other tasks.</li>
<li>Working long hours because it's fun.</li>
<li>Desire to work with a new technology</li>
<li>No problem working on weekends.</li>
</ul>
<p>After some time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation decreases.</li>
<li>Feels overwheelming.</li>
<li>Harder to justify working on the project when there are other responsibilities.</li>
<li>Other stuff seems more interesting now.</li>
<li>Forgot how to set things up to continue working on the project.</li>
<li>Not sure what I was working on.</li>
<li>Forgetting about the project and archiving it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-challenges-with-side-projects">The challenges with side projects <a href="#the-challenges-with-side-projects">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Context switching and high cognitive load is exhausting.</li>
<li><strong>Losing interest/ motivation</strong>.</li>
<li>Perfectionism - never ending projects.</li>
<li>Impostor syndrome.</li>
<li>Lack of focus.</li>
<li>Lack of time.</li>
<li>Unexpected life events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-framing-the-goal">Re framing the goal <a href="#re-framing-the-goal">#</a></h2>
<p>I believe you can set yourself for failure from the start if the goal is not clear.</p>
<p>I've been excited about ideas but later found that I was not really invested in the idea and just wanted to explore a cool feature/tool. It's good to go deeper to your true motivation.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed can also contribute to abandoning the project, I'll talk about <strong>small steps</strong> and why it's key.</p>
<p>If your track record includes lots of ambitious projects and none of them finished, then starting with something smaller seems like the logical approach.</p>
<p>Pick a small battle, maybe just the key feature first, maybe support for just one platform. Cut off features for the first version, remember that there's a lot of forces against you completing your project so reducing load is important.</p>
<h2 id="the-approach">The approach <a href="#the-approach">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear idea of what you want to finish, there's some actions and adjustments to your process that will increase the chance of winning the battle (shipping).</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing your environment (painless context switch)</li>
<li>Work in <strong>Small steps</strong></li>
<li>Mental warm-up before each session.</li>
<li>Anticipate and expect interruptions.</li>
<li>Changing your physical location.</li>
<li>Writting down the ideas on your mind at the end of the session.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-steps-are-key">Small steps are key <a href="#small-steps-are-key">#</a></h2>
<p>I like the idea of not having too many open boxes at the same time, where each box is a task/feature or something that you  started but haven't finished yet.</p>
<p>It's demoralizing to wait weeks or months for a win. Small steps give you small wins, it keeps the journey fun. There's less change of feeling stuck.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/06/26/more-on-small-steps/">Geepaw Hill</a> shares excellent resources on the topic of small steps in software.</p>
<h2 id="warming-up-before-each-session-to-reduce-cognitive-exhaustion">Warming up before each session to reduce cognitive exhaustion <a href="#warming-up-before-each-session-to-reduce-cognitive-exhaustion">#</a></h2>
<p>Before starting actual work, write about what would be good to achieve in the session. I find this ritual valuable as it helps me figure out the next small step. Writing the project goal (high level) every session is also a good way to switch context and reminding yourself what's it all about.</p>
<p>I'll talk about having a "context" log, where you write the current progress, and what to do next. If you have this file, reading the previous session log let's you resume your work faster.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-context-switching">Immediate context switching <a href="#immediate-context-switching">#</a></h2>
<p>With the limited amount of mental energy, is crucial to reduce the number of setup tasks required to do a working session on your project. The goal here is reducing the number of small decisions you have to make to have a working environment.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important things for me, and the way I approach it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a separated system User on my laptop.</li>
<li>Having an email address only for my project.</li>
<li>Having a "context" file where I log what's currently happening with my project, usually at the end of a work session.</li>
</ul>
<p>These have been valuable tools for me, let me explain why:</p>
<h3 id="a-separate-system-user-for-your-side-project">A separate system user for your side project <a href="#a-separate-system-user-for-your-side-project">#</a></h3>
<p>By creating a separate user, you automatically have all the operative system tools (calendar/notes/reminders , etc.) available ONLY for your project.</p>
<p>All the files on your desktop will have a relation to your project. This may not seem impressive but think about all the small distractions you find if you use the same user for your personal/work tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to find a file (filtering unrelated stuff will bring memories of other things)</li>
<li>Reminders/calendar notifications not related to your project</li>
<li>Dealing with other project setups can be stressful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it was Seth Godin who recommended having a separate laptop for a side project like writing a book. This is an alternative too.</p>
<p>You can add more extreme measures like redirecting distracting sites like news or reddit. If you need to login to one of those sites, it's better to switch user accounts. Try to keep your project user clean.</p>
<h3 id="having-an-separate-email-for-your-project">Having an separate email for your project <a href="#having-an-separate-email-for-your-project">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://hugozap.com/posts/ultimate-info-capturing-tool/">I'm a fan of email</a> as a note taking tool, it's available everywhere, the UI is simple. Having a separate email account lets you capture related notes/ideas/links from any device. This has been useful for me when I'm doing something else and have an idea, or find a resource that can be used to do something I want to incorporate into the project.</p>
<p>Later, when I log in to my project environment I'll get the emails with relevant information, no chance of getting distracted with other stuff.</p>
<h3 id="the-context-file%2C-(brain-dump).">The context file, (brain dump). <a href="#the-context-file%2C-(brain-dump).">#</a></h3>
<p>A context file is just a text file where you add a short summary of the current project status and what's on your mind at the time.</p>
<p>This has been valuable to me, because the act of writing it down helps me have a clear idea of things I could do next and next time I have time to work on my project I'll have a starting point and it reduces the cognitive load which maximizes the session efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location <a href="#location">#</a></h2>
<p>Going to a library or café (when possible) or event to another room and have a dedicated space for your current side project will make a difference.</p>
<p>Not sure about why, but using the same desk for different work and side projects is not ideal for me. If you can I recommend having a different place that helps you switch context quickly.</p>
<h2 id="abandoned-projects-may-not-be-a-failure-after-all.">Abandoned projects may not be a failure after all. <a href="#abandoned-projects-may-not-be-a-failure-after-all.">#</a></h2>
<p>Some abandoned projects end up being an inspiration to create something else years later. Maybe you learned something new, explored an idea, or found a problem not possible to solve with the knowledge and resources you had at the time.</p>
<p>It's good to have an open mind and be ok with finding dead-ends, they are powerful teachers.</p>
<p>However, shipping projects <strong>is awesome</strong> and by reducing scope and anticipating interruptions you will be able to complete your project and release it to the world.</p>

As of this writing, we’re still in the middle of a global pandemic that the United States seems to have just given up on.</p><p>We’re in seeing a renewed fight for social justice, with more of us fighting against centuries of racial inequality than ever before.</p><p>The first two quarters of 2020 have taken an emotional toll on me just like they probably have on you. Everyone is hurting – individuals and business owners included.</p><p>But for the last two years, I’ve written an annual reflection on my own business.</p><p>To be honest, the anniversary snuck up on me this year!</p><p>But I wanted to go a little deeper on this year’s reflection. I wanted to bring you some <strong>real numbers</strong>, some <strong>behind-the-scenes</strong>, and the <strong>lessons learned</strong>.</p><p>And it’s important to note – <strong>I do not equate earnings with success</strong>. I certainly don’t equate them with happiness. If you look at earnings alone, my 2019 would look like a&nbsp;<em>huge&nbsp;</em>step backwards. But in reality, I believe 2019 to be far more impactful than 2018.</p><p>I’m optimizing for flexibility, fulfillment, and long-term vision. So as you’ll see in my 2019 breakdown, I accepted a short-term earnings compromise to get there.</p><p>If you want the tl;dr version, here’s a visual overview of my P&amp;L every year from 2017. It includes the my actual figures for January through June of 2020, as well as a projection for the full year based upon those numbers.</p><p><picture><source data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.webp 822w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-300x169.webp 300w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-768x432.webp 768w,https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-100x56.webp 100w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" type="image/webp"><source data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.png 822w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-300x169.png 300w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-768x432.png 768w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-100x56.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20822%20462'%3E%3C/svg%3E" height="462" width="822" data-lazy-srcset="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.png 822w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-300x169.png 300w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-768x432.png 768w, https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2-100x56.png 100w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" data-lazy-src="https://jayclouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PL2020-2.png"></picture></p><p>If you’re ready to dig into what happened each of those years and why those trends look the way they do, let’s get started.</p><h2><strong>Year One: 2017</strong></h2><p>I spent the first four months of 2017 gainfully employed! Those earnings are <em>not</em> reflected in the numbers above or below, but it does mean that I had four fewer months to work with.</p><p>I quit my job in late April 2017. It came about a month sooner than I anticipated, but the timing seemed right for both me and the company I was leaving.</p><p>You can read more detail about that decision <a href="https://jayclouse.com/chapter-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, but it was a pretty half-baked move, truth be told.</p><p>I didn’t really have much of a plan, and I don’t recommend jumping into the deep end like I did!</p><p>The biggest victory was getting my first 15-member paid cohort of the Unreal Collective Accelerator off the ground.</p><p>Here’s my cringe-worthy first promotional video for Unreal Collective:</p><p>Pulling that first cohort together wasn’t<em>&nbsp;</em>easy. I ran a beta group of five members for a couple of months prior, and I was able to turn their stories into testimonials.</p><p>But I was still coming in with very little credibility.</p><p>The model behind the Unreal Collective Accelerator is pretty straightforward, and it’s similar to a typical mastermind program.</p><p>You take a small number of great people with ambitious goals, you force them into meeting once per week, and magic happens. <strong>Progress</strong> is made, <strong>goals</strong> are met, <strong>transformation</strong> is experienced.</p><p>Getting the right number of people, who mesh together well, ready to start the program at the same time is where you find the challenge.</p><p>But I’ve always been good at logistics and timelines, so I’m able to make it work – even if it was through brute force of a <em>lot </em>of conversations.</p><p>I wasn’t even calling it an accelerator at the time! I wasn’t sure what it was going to be – I <a href="https://jayclouse.com/on-unreal-collective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thought</a> it might be a live events company.</p><p>After that first program ended, it was October. And I realized I wasn’t going to be able to pull another group together before the end of the year due to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the new year.</p><p>So my financial engine was put on pause until 2018.</p><p>And I was broke.</p><p>To scrape by, I picked up a couple of freelance gigs building simple WordPress websites, writing email sequences, and helping a friend launch his podcast.</p><p>Then in late December, I got a surprise email: an opportunity to become a LinkedIn Learning instructor. I walked through the application process and was accepted shortly thereafter.</p><h3><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h3><ul><li>👍&nbsp; Creating a budget was absolutely critical</li><li>👍&nbsp; Investing in mentorship and my own education was well worth it</li><li>👍&nbsp; When I’m in a bind, I look for work from the people close to me</li><li>👎&nbsp; I need to learn how to predict my cash flow</li><li>👎&nbsp; Things take longer to get started than I expect</li><li>👎&nbsp; When I underprice myself, it’s problematic through the project and for months afterward</li></ul><h3><strong>By the Numbers</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Gross income</strong>: $29,468</li><li><strong>Expenses</strong>: $18,289</li><li><strong>Net income</strong>: $11,179</li></ul><h2><strong>Year Two: 2018</strong></h2><p>The start of the new year couldn’t come soon enough. When the year began, I was still working on a freelance marketing contract that saved my butt at the end of 2017.</p><p>But I wanted to start a new cohort of the Unreal Collective Accelerator.</p><p>And actually, 2018 was the first time I started calling it an Accelerator. I put a lot of thought into Unreal Collective as a business, because I wanted it to be a brand that meant more than just the 12-week program.</p><p>In February, I pulled my thoughts together and decided Unreal would split into three core product offerings:</p><ol><li>The 12-week program (Unreal Collective Accelerator)</li><li>A community membership (Unreal Collective)</li><li>Digital products and courses (called Guides at the time)</li></ol><p>I broke it all down in this 24-minute monologue called “Unreal Collective 2.0” that I shared with the community (then about 35 people):</p><p>To start the year, I brought together another cohort of 15 people. At the same time, I began writing my first LinkedIn Learning course and even accepted a part-time Entrepreneur In Residence position with Columbus’s Smart City team.</p><p>So things got off to a strong start.</p><p>But I burned myself out. Outside of my business, I was:</p><ul><li>Serving as Entrepreneur in Residence for Smart Columbus</li><li>Helping organize a track of events for Columbus Startup Week</li><li>Organizing a hackathon for Smart Columbus</li><li>Serving as Vice Chair of a nonprofit organization</li><li>Organizing a 6-month outdoor music series</li></ul><p>…and most of that was a volunteer effort.</p><p>The Smart Columbus role was fantastic – I was able to make an impact for the team and we put on an incredible event.</p><p>And somehow I also wrote 4 courses for LinkedIn Learning, ran two cohorts of the Unreal Collective Accelerator, and launched our podcast, <a href="https://upside.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upside</a>.</p><p><a href="https://jayclouse.com/two-years-into-the-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read my full 2018 reflection here</a></p><p>It was a strong year of earnings, but I really wanted to focus and devote more time to my core business. So I stepped away from the Smart Columbus role, the Vice Chair role, and the music series.</p><h3><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h3><ul><li>👍&nbsp; Creating LinkedIn courses were great for cash flow and creating my own content</li><li>👍&nbsp; Coaching others was a viable service that people benefitted from</li><li>👍&nbsp; Freelance work can pay pretty well</li><li>👍&nbsp; I can pick up freelance work pretty easily</li><li>👎&nbsp; Freelancing can also be a diversion from my core business goals</li><li>👎&nbsp; Volunteering a lot of my time was hurting my business</li><li>👎&nbsp; Earning more doesn’t matter if my costs increase</li><li>👎&nbsp; Earning close to my previous salary doesn’t matter if I’m saving far less</li></ul><h3><strong>By the Numbers</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Gross income</strong>: $72,713 (<strong><span>147% increase</span></strong>)</li><li><strong>Expenses</strong>: $45,834 (<strong><span>151% increase</span></strong>)</li><li><strong>Net income</strong>: $26,879 (<strong><span>140% increase</span></strong>)</li></ul><h2><strong>Year Three: 2019</strong></h2><p>In 2019, I resolved to do <em>less </em>so that I could do <em>more</em>. I <a href="https://jayclouse.com/doing-fewer-doing-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in January 2019:</p><blockquote><p>This year is all about doing fewer so that I can do more.

    <p>
      To really explain why I use org-mode for <bold>everything</bold>, I probably first have to explain my rules, which also requires a backstory.  I'll keep it short, no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jacked into Unix the first time at Calhoun Community College, in Decatur, Alabama, during the summer of 1974.  I was 15, and my dad was a part-time programming instructor.  Having been an avid reader since the age of 6 (I read the entire elementary school library before the middle of second grade), text and text-processing was much on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>So when I encountered a system where plain text is the raw material flowing through the pipes, I was hooked.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <br>
      ...what I really learned was that the rules of Unix could be adapted to life.
      </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      This led me to undertake an informal study of Unix, all the way back to the Tech Model Railroad Club and all the hackers that came from there.  Yeah, I read the story about Margaret and the groceries and the Volkswagen; I understand his pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I really learned was that the rules of Unix could be adapted to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about 30 years as a tech writer and frequent programmer, I finally settled on a set that works for me.  Little did I know that these very principles would lead me to org-mode, which would later lead me to find my people.
    </p>

      <center>
	Unix rules for life
      </center>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep it simple: It's cheaper and easier to carry around.</li>
      <li>Do one thing at a time: Multitasking is a lie.</li>
      <li>Network: You were born to connect.</li>
      <li>Say what you mean; nothing is truer than the truth.</li>
      <li>Hack: Trial and error is the only way we learn anything</li>
      <li>Be who you are: Even a bent wire can carry a great light.</li>
      <li>Use leverage; a bigger hammer isn't always the answer.</li>
      <li>Use what you have: never dig diamonds with a brick of gold.</li>
      <li>Have faith; all's possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</li>
      <li>Think ahead, but don't worship your plans; remember today is the first day of the rest of your learning experience.</li>

<h3>
  a vi convert
</h3>
<p>
  I didn't start with org-mode, actually, but with plain journal files labeled YYYYMMDD, in a special directory in <code>/var/log</code>.  I still have those going back to sometime in the 90's.  The format was simple, but using the files soon became complex:
  </p><pre>	  
    *** personal journal of stormrider
    tue, aug 04, 1992 / 712904400
    sweetmorn, confusion 70, 3158 YOLD
    
    *** fortune -s
    Cold hands, no gloves.
    
    *** appts

    18:30  dinner with amit &amp; bonnie

    .
    .
    .
    
    *** daily journal
    06:43 - man, didn't sleep well
    last night; i think i'm overdoing
    it on the coffee at work; maybe i
    should cut back some?
    .
    .
    .
  </pre>
  The unwieldy part came with all the repeated tasks, and tasks that got carried over from one day to the next (or didn't get finished). I had to copy yesterday's file, change all the key info, sort out the todo list, erase yesterday's journal, and generally do far too much work to keep my journal up.

<blockquote>

  I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-nineties, when I moved to Atlanta to work for HP.  A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me write and code up examples more effectively.  He was right, and it stuck....
  </blockquote>
<p>
  I did it, but intermittently, supplanting it with post-it notes, pads, planners galore, palm pilots, palmtop computers, etc.  It seemed like every day I was badly copying tasks from one day to the next. Meanwhile, my unwillingness to use Windows didn't give the the luxury of Outlook, when it came along.
</p>
<p>
  I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-nineties, when I moved to Atlanta to work for HP.  A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me write and code up examples more effectively.  He was right, and it stuck as my editing platform of choice.
</p>
<p>
But I hadn't discovered org-mode yet. Either he didn't use it, or it hadn't been invented yet.  And to be honest, I kinda went back and forth between vi and emacs, depending on my "mood of the month."
</p>
<h3>
  a modem in the woods
</h3>
<p>
  Eventually, my HP job became a telecommuting-type arrangment, and I moved home to the farm, about an hour outside New Orleans, in the woods.  At that time, Internet was still modem-driven out here, so having command-line Linux with emacs on my laptop was a real lifesaver.
</p>
<p>
  Sometime not long before Katrina hit, I stumbled across org-mode.  I'd already used outline mode for some period of time (can't remember how long), and org-mode seemed like a logical follow-on from there.
      </p>
      <p>
	From there, org-mode just grew, and I grew with it.  All the features made it easy for me to both do what seemed natural for me, and do things in a way that felt like they supported my principles.  Gradually, my other methods of keeping track of things faded away, except for my alarm clock.  </p>
<p>
  Even when smart-phones took off, I was always trying to find some way to send org files over to my phone and use them there.  I think I even wrote some lua code in an iPhone wiki app to emulate org-mode with my files, though it was not fully satisfactory.
</p>
<h3>
  an org-mode resume
</h3>
      <p>
	Fast-forward to last May.  I'd been wanting to get on with Canonical for a long time, but hadn't found the right position, one that really matched my skills.  Then one Saturday, while I was waiting for my wife to meet me for some community event we were hosting, I saw a position that virtually described me.  I started to write a resume, but then decided that I would just take the job description elements, one-by-one, put them in an org file, and send them to the hiring manager.
      </p>
<p>
  Long-story short, almost everyone on this team used emacs, and org-mode, and lots of other .el packages that I also used every day.  I got the job, and so far, I'm very happy and feel like I fit in very well.
      </p>
      <h3>
	org-mode and my principles
      </h3>
      <p>
	Here's how I feel about using org-mode for everything: email, git, irc, web-browsing, organization, time-keeping, and so on.  And yes, I do use org-mode to connect with my email and the web, even though I use other packages (rmail, eww, magit, erc) to do the heavy lifing.  Let me walk it down, principle by principle:
	</p><ul>
	  <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Granted, emacs isn't the simplest user interface, that is, until it becomes second nature.  After that, you'll find yourself accidentally erasing cells in your Google spreadsheet when you hit "C-x C-s" to try to save (good thing there's an undo). But the fact that you can use the same text for multiple functions: appointments, task states, task notes, clocking time, building an agenda, sending email, project planning, percentage completion, ....  The list is too long to quote, but just a simple statement, like "Get the discourse publishing tool working," can become the nucleus for a whole cycle's work and all the actions that go with it.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Do one thing at a time:</strong> The window-driven nature of emacs makes it easy to switch tasks when you have to (just open another buffer) and then switch back later, and more quickly link back to where you were; not to mention that, if you become adept at using the agenda, you can keep yourself on track and move other things around with ease, and without any fear that they'll get lost.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Network:</strong> Since I'm set up to send email, IRC, Mattermost, etc., directly from my org-mode tasks, it's easy to track where I am.  But even if I used another app, it's still really easy to just cut and paste a note next to a task and then set a follow-up time to prod, all without breaking your train of thought.  You're literally still looking at the work you're doing while you're messaging about it, so there's that.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Say what you mean:</strong> You have the entire outline in front of you for whatever you're working on, so presentations, show-and-tell sessions, and status reports are really simple to give, whether verbally or in writing.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Hack...:</strong> If it doesn't do what you want, you've got customizable variables, a huge library of packages, strong macro capability, and push-come-to-shove, emacs lisp, though I rarely have to go there, TBH.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Be who you are:</strong> Org-mode matches my thinking style. Not true for everyone, but I tend to outline or mindmap (which you can do with org-mode, with the right .el package).</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Use leverage:</strong> Org-mode seriously leverages the power of plain text, in that you can either use the shortcuts to add an appointment, add tags, search tags -- or you can just do it by hand, because all of the special notation is plain text.  Leveraging human language in this way is helpful to me.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Use what you have:</strong> Org-mode and emacs give me a stable platform that works everywhere, even on a printout.  I don't need license fees, special extensions, subscriptions, add-on tools, or constant updates to keep my life humming.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Have faith:</strong> Org-mode has justified my faith, as has emacs.  Lots of tools I've used break, crash, or get killed by absorption (I once liked Astrid, e.g., but it suddenly got sold and went away).  Org-mode and emacs are pretty much here to stay, especially since there is no license fee, and I can keep a self-contained version backed up at home, should it ever stop being distributed.</li><br>
	  <li><strong>Think ahead:</strong> This is where org-mode, and especially the agenda, shine.  If I'm busy, I don't have to worry about keeping my outline clean.  I can stop in the middle of notes for another project, hit return, enter a to do for later (and tag it and schedule it to pop up later), and then move that to someplace more suitable later.  The agenda will clean it up and put it in perspective for me.  Or I can search for it, or pull up all open to-do items …</li></ul></div>

  <p>PostgreSQL is open source software so we can install it wthout any limitation, including our personal code changes. It is distributed under own The PostgreSQL License(TPL).</p>
<p>Installation of PostgreSQL is easy on Linux Distributions.<br>
For purpose of tutorial we use CentOS 8.</p>
<p>We shuold get newest PostgreSQL from official repo - version in OS repos are mostly old - like for now when we get with CentOS 8 PostgreSQL 9.6 :)</p>

This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale <span>"en_US.UTF-8"</span>.
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to <span>"UTF8"</span>.
The default text search configuration will be set to <span>"english"</span>.

Growth startups require both personal and business scaling.</p>

<p>The hardest part of working at a growth startup is having to re-interview for your job every year.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge-of-scaling">The challenge of scaling</h3>

<p>You’re heading a key function at your 25-person startup. Maybe you’re head of engineering; maybe you run marketing. Hell, maybe you’re the CEO. You kick ass and your startup grows fast – and with that growth, the needs of the company evolve. Things in the new world are now going okay, but perhaps not optimally. Eventually, the CEO and board of directors get in a room to discuss what to do.</p>

<p>I can tell you what will happen in this room. The board will discuss your performance, and compare it to the performance of other, hypothetical executives – just as if you were interviewing for your own job. In your favor: you are a known quantity, presumably viewed as talented, and perhaps even a close friend. Against you: you haven’t done this before, and we need results now.</p>

<p>In many cases this conversation will lead to you being demoted or asked to leave. In extra cruel circumstances, you can literally get fired for having done a great job. This is normal, semi-expected, and sucks. And this happens to everyone – even founding CEOs are not immune.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this situation? These hard truths often go unspoken. Sometimes it’s just too awkward to tell someone who’s been there through thick and thin that they’re expected to be a stand-in for a future big league exec. And if you have a first-time management team, they might not even realize what’s going on – they may also be in the process of not scaling fast enough, either. At least when you’re interviewing, you’re explicitly given the chance to shine; such opportunities may not be spoon-fed to you during hectic growth.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-scale-yourself">How to scale yourself</h3>

<p>To avoid this situation you need to become a self-scaling machine. Read voraciously, and find opportunities to put new skills into practice – during growth mode there’s always too much to do, so take advantage and gain actual battlefield experience. You should constantly have an image in your mind of where you expect your team to be in 6 months and steer towards that future world. Learning to see around corners allows you to scale independently, and independence is a key leadership trait since <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/05/07/startup-is-this-normal.html">startups are constantly on fire</a>. Finding mentors who are at least 2-3 years ahead of you in terms of their own careers is another great way to build these instincts.</p>

<p>And most importantly, <em>ask questions</em>. Ask your manager how they expect your job will be different in 6 months (if you’re the CEO, this advice will be slightly different –&nbsp;a trusted advisor and/or executive coach can help). Ask them what they see as your current trajectory in the role. In my experience people are way too shy about asking direct questions in general, especially to their managers – it is literally your manager’s job to provide high-quality answers to your career questions. If you nail this, it’s a fast track towards increasing responsibility and growth.</p>

<h3 id="this-isnt-a-bad-thing">This isn’t a bad thing!</h3>

<p>From the other perspective, well-run growth startups give you the regular opportunity to interview for roles that are a level higher (or two!). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissamayer/">This</a> is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbenioff/">proven way</a> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericsyuan/">accelerate</a> your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai#Career">career</a>. If you scale with a growing organization, you can pack decades of experience into years.</p>

The code for each technique is included under the corresponding Implementation heading.</em></p>

<h2 id="section-0"><a href="#section-0">Background</a></h2>

<h3 id="section-1"><a href="#section-1">Taylor series</a></h3>

<p>To motivate the definition of $e$, we will recall some calculus. Let $f$ be a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmoothFunction.html">smooth</a> function at $a$. This is to say that $f$ is infinitely <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Differentiable.html">differentiable</a> at some real value $a$: for every $k^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k)}$, we can differentiate $f^{(k)}$ again to obtain the $(k + 1)^{\text{th}}$ derivative $f^{(k + 1)}$. By definition, any function with this property which can also be uniquely represented as a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaylorSeries.html">Taylor series</a> expansion “centered” at $a$ is called <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RealAnalyticFunction.html">analytic</a>. The Taylor series of $f$ centered at $a$ and evaluated at $x$ is defined to be</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = \frac{f(a)}{0!}(x - a)^0 + \frac{f’(a)}{1!}(x - a)^1 + \ldots + \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSeries.html">power series</a>, or infinite polynomial with one variable. The center of expansion determines a neighborhood of values returned by the Taylor series, and the coefficient of each <em>Taylor term</em> is determined by repeatedly differentiating the function $f$ and evaluating it at $a$. A common center of expansion is $a$ = 0, in which case the Taylor series is also called a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaclaurinSeries.html">Maclaurin series</a> and the series is centered around the origin. This can be considered the “default” setting. If you cut off all terms of the Taylor expansion after some term $k$, you obtain a polynomial with degree $k$. The coefficient of the $k^{\text{th}}$ term of the series (or polynomial, if truncated) is given by</p>

<p>$$
a_{k} = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}
$$</p>

<p>where 0! = 1.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, consider the Taylor series expansion of the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html">sine</a> function. The sine function is not only infinitely differentiable, but cyclic.</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin^{(1)}(x) &amp;= \cos(x), \\
\sin^{(2)}(x) &amp;= \cos^{(1)}(x) = -\sin(x), \\
\sin^{(3)}(x) &amp;= -\sin^{(1)}(x) = -\cos(x), \\
\sin^{(4)}(x) &amp;= -\cos^{(1)}(x) = \sin(x)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>We determine each $k^{\text{th}}$ coefficient of the Taylor series by evaluating $f^{(k)}$ at $a$ and dividing it by the factorial of $k$. If we want to expand the sine function around the origin ($a$ = 0), we obtain the cyclic coefficients</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(0) &amp;= 0, \\
\sin^{(1)}(0) &amp;= \cos(0) = 1, \\
\sin^{(2)}(0) &amp;= \cos^{(1)}(0) = -\sin(0) = 0, \\
\sin^{(3)}(0) &amp;= -\sin^{(1)}(0) = -\cos(0) = -1, \\
\sin^{(4)}(0) &amp;= -\cos^{(1)}(0) = \sin(0) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>Since $(x - 0)^{k} = x^{k}$, we have the Taylor series expansion</p>

<p>$$
\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} - \ldots
$$</p>

<p>Truncating the Taylor expansion of a function $f$ at any term $k$ gives a finite approximation of $f$ using the $k$ degree <em>Taylor polynomial</em>. A Taylor polynomial of $f$ centered at $a$ produces very accurate approximations of $f(x)$ when $x$ is relatively close to $a$. As the absolute value of $x$ increases away from $a$, the accuracy of the Taylor polynomial rapidly decreases, which means it requires more terms of the Taylor series (i.e. a higher degree polynomial) for accurate approximation. Consider the following plot, which shows the values of $\sin(x)$ over the interval $[-20, 20]$ compared to its Taylor polynomials of degree 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 centered at $a$ = 0.</p>

<figure>
  <p><a href="https://www.pseudorandom.com/assets/images/articles/implementing-exp/sin_taylor_series.svg"><img src="https://www.pseudorandom.com/assets/images/articles/implementing-exp/sin_taylor_series.svg"></a></p>
  <figcaption>$T_{n}$ denotes the degree $n$ Taylor polynomial of $\sin$</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Observe that the Taylor approximation of $\sin(x)$ is more accurate when $x$ is near $a$ = 0, but quickly flies away from the true value of $\sin(x)$ further away from 0. The degree 1 Taylor polynomial is only an accurate approximation for $\sin(x)$ for a very small interval near the origin, whereas the degree 9 Taylor polynomial is very accurate within $[-5, 5]$. How long the approximation holds until it becomes extremely inaccurate depends on the number of terms of the Taylor polynomial. A higher degree polynomial will maintain a better approximation of $\sin(x)$ for longer, but any finite polynomial will eventually become extremely inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="section-2"><a href="#section-2">Defining $e$</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html">mathematical constant</a> $e$ is (almost) entirely motivated by the very nice properties it exhibits under exponentiation. In particular, the definition of $e$ was born out of the desire to find a continuous function which is its own derivative and which maps the additive identity 0 to the multiplicative identity 1. This is because solving difficult integration and differentiation problems is vastly more expedient with such a function. By extension a significant fraction of problems in applied mathematics and physics reduce to solving differential equations, for which such a function is fundamental.</p>

<p>As it happens, $f(x) = e^x$ uniquely satisfies this property. We can show this, and define $e$ directly in the process, by starting from the Taylor series representation of an arbitrary function $f$ infinitely differentiable at $a$ = 0. Suppose $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ are the coefficients of the Taylor series of $f$ centered at $a$. Then we have the Taylor series</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>It follows from the linearity of differentiation that the Taylor series expansion of the first derivative $f’$ is</p>

<p>$$
f’(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>To determine a function which is its own derivative, we solve for the coefficients $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ which satisfy $f = f’$:</p>

<p>$$
a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + \ldots
$$</p>

<p>From here we can see the pattern</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_0 &amp;= a_1, \\
a_1 &amp;= 2a_2, \\
a_2 &amp;= 3a_3
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>and so on, which is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &amp;= a_0, \\
a_2 &amp;= \frac{a_1}{2}, \\
a_3 &amp;= \frac{a_2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>By induction we have a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecurrenceEquation.html">recurrence relation</a> which defines the $k^{\text{th}}$ coefficient $a_k$</p>

<p>$$
a_k = \frac{a_{k - 1}}{k}
$$</p>

<p>Given $a_0$ = 1, we find that the Taylor series of a function which is its own derivative is</p>

<p>$$
f(x) = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots.
$$</p>

<p>We denote this function with $e^x$, where $e$ is defined to be the value of this function at $x$ = 1.</p>

<p>$$
e = f(1) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k!} = 2.7183\ldots
$$</p>

<p>A more intuitive illustration of why $e^x$ is special is given by the following graph, in which exponential functions with various bases are plotted alongside their derivatives. An exponential function with a base less than $e$, like $b$ = 2, grows more quickly than its derivative. But when the base is greater than $e$, like $b$ = 4, it grows less quickly than its derivative.</p>

  <figcaption>When $b &lt; e$, we have $f'(x) &lt; f(x)$. When $b &gt; e$, we have $f'(x) &gt; f(x)$. But $b = e$ is the "goldilocks" base at which $f'(x) = f(x)$.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="section-3"><a href="#section-3">Floating point</a></h3>

<p>There is an intrinsic tension in that we want to determine accurate values of $e^x$ without doing too much work. Before we can consider the efficiency of an algorithm, we need to consider its accuracy. This leads us to define a variety of types of error, the most important of which comes from the way we approximate real numbers. It’s often impossible to calculate the exact value of $f(x)$ for an arbitrary function $f$, because computers can’t work with arbitrary real numbers.<label for="cb-3"><sup id="footnote-3"><span>3</span></sup></label><span><p>3:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all">Almost all</a> real numbers are not <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputableNumber.html">computable</a>. The reals which are computable are frequently not exactly representable to a desirable level of accuracy because they’re either irrational (and therefore have infinite decimal expansions) or rational with very long decimal expansions.</p></span> The best we can do is approximate the value to some acceptable accuracy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> <em>floating point</em> standard discretizes real intervals into a computable form by mapping all nearby real values in given neighborhoods to a single rounded value. Internally, an IEEE 754 binary floating point number $N$ is represented using the normalized form</p>

<p>$$
N = \pm b_1.b_2b_3 \ldots b_p \times 2^{E_{k}}
$$</p>

<p>where the first bit is allocated for the sign (the <em>sign bit</em>), the $p$ bits $b_1.b_2b_3 \ldots b_p$ comprise the <em>mantissa</em>, or <em>significand</em>, and $E_{k}$ is an integer exponent consisting of $k$ bits. Note that since this form is normalized, $b_1 = 1$, while each of $b_2, \ldots b_p$ may equal 0 or 1. IEEE 754 single precision binary floating point numbers have a total size of $32$ bits: $8$ are allocated for the exponent $E \in [-126, 127]$ and $23$ are allocated for the mantissa (with $p$ = 24 accounting for the normalized bit). Thus you can represent $2^{32}$ different values in single precision floating point, with underflow and overflow limits of $2^{127} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38}$ and $2^{-126} …</p></article></div>

      <h2 id="new-blog-series-deep-learning-papers-visualized">New blog series: Deep Learning Papers visualized</h2>
<p>This is the first post of a new series I am starting where I explain the content of a paper in a visual picture-based way.
To me, this helps tremendously to better grasp the ideas and remember them and I hope this will be the same for many of you as well.</p>
<h2 id="todays-paper-accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-imagenet-in-1-hour-by-goyal-et-al">Today’s paper: Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour by Goyal et al.</h2>
<p>The first paper I’ve chosen is well-known when it comes to training deep learning models on multiple GPUs. Here is the link to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677">paper of Goyal et al.</a> on arxiv.
The basic idea of the paper is this: when you are doing deep learning research today, you are using more and more data and more complex models. As the complexity and size rises, of course also the computational needs rise tremendously. This means that you typically need much longer to train a model to convergence.
But if you need longer to train a model, your feedback loop is long which is frustrating as you already get many other ideas in the mean time, but as it takes so long to train, you cannot try them all out.
So what can you do?</p>
<p>You can train on multiple GPUs at the same time and in theory get results faster the more GPUs you use. Assume you need 1 week to train your model on a single GPU, then with 2 GPUs in parallel, you should be able to achieve the same training in about 3.5 days and when using 7 GPUs you only need a day.</p>
<p>So how does it work to train your model on multiple GPUs? Typically, data parallelization is used which simply means that when you have your epoch, you send some distinct data to each distinct GPU. But then how do you get a model that benefits from all the data? Basically, you always synchronize the gradients, so after each batch, you collect the gradients from each GPU, calculate the average of the gradients over all GPUs and then adjust the model weights.</p>
<p>Let’s take a visual look at this:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-image-net-in-1-hour/multi_gpu_training_batch_sizes.png" alt="Training the same amount of data on 1 vs 2 vs 4 GPUs">
    
      <figcaption>Training the same amount of data on 1 vs 2 vs 4 GPUs</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h3 id="increasing-the-batch-size---increasing-the-learning-rate">Increasing the batch size -&gt; increasing the learning rate</h3>
<p>Note what happens when you do this: your batch size is rising!
Let’s say you have 200 images per epoch and your batch size is 10. Then for a single GPU, you have 20 batches per epoch à 10 images. If you train on 2 GPUs, then your batch size is twice the size: 20. That’s because each of your two GPUs gets 10 images and calculates the gradients of those 10 and then you take the average of the gradients of those 2 GPUs, so your gradients are averaged over 20 images. This means that your epoch now only has 10 batches per epoch à 20 images. So by increasing the batch size, your are also reducing the number of batches per epoch and this in turn is exactly why it’s almost (except for the synchronization overhead) twice as fast to train.
Similarly, if you were to use 4 GPUs, then each GPU receives 10 images per batch, so your effective batch size is 40. Thus, you only need 5 batches per epoch to train your 200 images.</p>
<p>But in turn, if you only use 5 batches per epoch instead of 20, that also means that you are only taking 5 gradient descent steps instead of 20 on a single GPU.
We need to take a look what that means:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-image-net-in-1-hour/formula_3_and_4.png" alt="Equations 3 and 4 from the paper">
    
      <figcaption>Equations 3 and 4 from the paper</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>Equation 3 represents the single GPU case after k iterations, in our case let’s take k = 4, so after 4 batches. This means we were updating our weights 4 times which is the first sum with j &lt; k, so j=0, j=1, j=2 and j=3. The second sum is the loop over the images in the corresponding batch and we calculate the gradient ($\nabla l$) determined by our weights at that time t+j and the image example x. We divide everything by n which is just the batch size, so n=10 in our example case and multiply by the learning rate $\eta$.</p>
<p>In contrast, equation 4 represents the multi GPU case for 4 GPUs (as we had k = 4). The 4 GPUs only take a single gradient descent step as the batch size is 4 times as large ($kn=4*10=40$). In this case, the first sum with j &lt; k is over our 4 GPUs and the seconds sum over the batch of each individual GPU. As we take the average of all of these, we divide by $kn=40$. This means that our step is k times smaller.</p>
<p>Now, the main idea of the paper is that we can make sure that the step size is roughly the same by scaling up our learning rate by the number of GPUs we are using: $\hat{\eta}=k * \eta$.
By doing so, equations 3 and 4 become roughly the same, because $\hat{\eta} * \frac{1}{kn} = k*\eta * \frac{1}{kn} = \eta * \frac{k}{kn} = \eta * \frac{1}{n}$.</p>
<p>Or to visualize:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/accurate-large-minibatch-sgd-training-image-net-in-1-hour/four_steps_is_one_step.png" alt="Four SGD steps on a single GPU is a single step with four GPUs">
    
      <figcaption>Four SGD steps on a single GPU is a single step with four GPUs</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>
<p>To summarize so far: when we increase the number of GPUs to train with, we are increasing the effective batch size which leads to less batches per epoch and thus less SGD training steps. To compensate for less steps, we need to scale the learning rate linearly. This is simple: multiply the original single GPU learning rate by the number of GPUs you are using to train now. For example if your learning rate was 1e-3 before with a single GPU and now you train with 4 GPUs, then simply increase it to 4e-3.</p>
<p>Why does it intuitively make sense to scale the learning rate?</p>
<p>When your batch size is larger you will get a better estimate of the direction of the gradient in the right direction -&gt; your gradients are less fuzzy. Thus, when you have a more representative gradient, it makes sense to be able to take a larger step as the likelihood of walking in the wrong direction is reduced by the larger sample of examples.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration with the single GPU model taking 4 small steps (yellow) and the 4 GPU model taking 1 larger step (blue; the learning rate is multiplied by 4, so the step is four times as large):</p>

<h3 id="problem-initial-large-learning-rates">Problem: initial large learning rates</h3>
<p>The authors note that the learning process is most vulnerable in the beginning, because the weights are initialized at random and steps in the wrong direction can lead to a suboptimal space. Thus, they argue that the learning rate should not be immediately set to the higher value, but rather a learning rate annealing schedule should be used, so it starts low and then increases over time.</p>
<p>They try out different warm-up schedules and conclude that it works best to warm-up over 5 epochs, so that after 5 epochs the maximal learning rate is reached. However, I already observed machine learning models where a longer warm-up period is required, so you should try it out for your own problem.</p>
<p>How does this look like in practice? Assume your learning rate for single GPU training is 1e-3. So you want to end up at 4e-3 when training with 4 GPUs. So you need to add the learning rate (4-1) times to itself over 5 epochs: $lr_{epoch} = lr_{single-gpu} + lr_{single-gpu} * (n-1) * (epoch / 5)$. Here, $lr_{epoch}$ is the learning rate to use in a given epoch, $lr_{single-gpu}$ is the initial learning rate, n is the number of GPUs and epoch is your epoch.</p>
<p>And this is how this warm-up looks like over epochs:</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>While the paper goes into more details, I discussed the most practical aspects of it and tried to visualize the key parts.</p>
<p>In particular, when training your machine learning model with multiple GPUs, you should scale your learning rate linearly with the number of GPUs you are using.
However, due to initial instability, use a learning rate warmup period which scales the learning rate linearly over the first couple of epochs.
By doing so, you are able to achieve similar loss curves as in the single GPU training.</p>
<p>The authors were able to train a ResNet-50 on ImageNet with a batch size of 8192 (!) on 256 GPUs at the same time and thus needing only 1 hour to train ImageNet. When the increased the batch size further than this, however, the accuracy got worse than the single GPU training, so there is still a (high) limit to how much you can reduce the training time by using more GPUs.</p>
<p>If you want to see how to implement this in PyTorch, check out <a href="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/pytorch-multi-gpu-training-for-faster-machine-learning-results/">my article PyTorch multi-GPU training for faster machine learning results</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-spent-my-summer">how I spent my summer</h3>

<p>A few months ago, I decided to implement set operations on curved regions.  I had the <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540779735">the canonical textbook on computational geometry</a>, which described approaches for polygons comprised of straight lines, and it seemed like <a href="http://paperjs.org/">other projects</a> had extended these techniques to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">parametric curves</a>.  I figured it would take a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the field of computational geometry embodies a fundamental contradiction.  In geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to exactly π radians, and if <em>u</em> is clockwise from <em>v</em> then <em>v</em> must be counter-clockwise from <em>u</em>.  Computers, on the other hand, use floating point representations which make a mockery of these simple Euclidean truths.</p>

<p>The academic literature largely ignores this.  Algorithms are proven to be geometrically sound, and robust implementations are left as an exercise for the reader.  This is akin to a world in which hash collisions caused unavoidable data loss, and the academic response was to implicitly assume the existence of a perfect hash function.  If a paper is predicated on unrealistic assumptions, we cannot evaluate it on its own terms; we must understand, empirically, how well it functions when these assumptions are broken.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can now look at the existing algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics)">polygon clipping</a>, which is the term of art for polygon set operations.  Every technique is a variation on a common theme:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-clipping.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>Given two or more rings, find every point of intersection</li>
  <li>Segment the rings at the points of intersection</li>
  <li>Decide whether each segment should be included, based on the operation being performed</li>
</ul>

<p>The dozen or so papers on this subject differ only in the third step.  Since our decision to include a segment typically inverts at an intersection point, they describe a variety of approaches for using our decision to about one segment to inform our decision about adjacent segments.</p>

<p>My textbook described a method using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">doubly-connected edge lists</a>, which is a generic geometric data structure.  I assumed that meant it could be reused for other problems, so I started my implementation.</p>

<p>A month went by.</p>

<p>I had finished the implementation my first week, but it wasn’t reliable.  A DCEL is a collection of linked loops, which can be incrementally updated.  When performing a set operation, we incrementally bisect the original set of loops, and then determine which should and shouldn’t be included.  Despite my best efforts, I kept finding new shapes that caused adjacent faces to get tangled together, creating a Möbius strip that is simultaneously inside and outside the expected result.</p>

<p>Slowly, I realized the problem wasn’t the data structure, it was the first step that every paper glossed over: finding all the intersections.  The DCEL assumes the edges at a vertex have a total ordering: the previous edge is directly clockwise, and the next one is directly counter-clockwise.  If we miss an intersection, we might conclude two curves are both clockwise relative to the other, causing everything to fall apart.</p>

<p>I began to look for better ways to find intersections, hoping that if I found an approach that was sufficiently accurate, my work on the DCEL could be salvaged.  Unfortunately, the approaches I found in the literature and implemented in the wild were no better than what I had been using.  My data structure demanded precise inputs, without internal contradictions, and I couldn’t deliver.</p>

<p>At that point, I began to wonder if I had missed something fundamental.  I thought maybe if I dissected how other, more mature, libraries handled my pathological shapes, I could work backwards to see where I had gone wrong.  But when I began to feed these shapes into well-established projects like paper.js, I found they failed just as badly.</p>

<p>To find my pathological inputs, I had been using property-based testing.  Given a random combination of shapes, I would perform a point-in-region test and compare it to a reference result, generated by querying each shape individually and combining the results according to the operation.  Most inputs worked fine, but after a few hundred thousand inputs it would inevitably find some failure.</p>

<p>Other projects, it turned out, had been a little less eager to find their own failure modes.  Some only had a handful of example-based tests, others had a static suite of a few thousand inputs they used to validate their changes.  If I had missed something, it appeared to be that no one else expected these operations to be particularly robust.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="why-is-this-so-hard">why is this so hard?</h3>

<p>Floating point arithmetic is best understood through a simple, maddening fact: <code>a + (b - a)</code> does not necessarily equal <code>b</code>.  It might be equal, or it might be off by just a little, where “little” is relative to the larger of the two numbers.  This means that when we compare two floating point numbers, we cannot do a precise comparison, we have to ask whether they differ by less than some <em>epsilon</em> value.</p>

<p>This epsilon represents the level of numerical uncertainty to which we’ve resigned ourselves.  There is vast folk wisdom around how to minimize this uncertainty, but the fact remains that every arithmetic operation injects a bit of uncertainty, and it grows cumulatively with each successive operation.  When dealing with small numbers, this uncertainty may dwarf the values themselves.</p>

<p>An intersection, in a precise mathematical sense, occurs wherever the distance between the curves is exactly zero:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-precise-intersection.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But in a practical sense, it is wherever the distance between the curves is close enough to zero:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-fuzzy-intersection.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This has at least one intersection, but we could just as easily return three or ten within that overlapping range.  This uncertainty is anathema to the published techniques, which rely on counting these intersections to determine whether we’re inside or outside the other shape.  A single spurious intersection may cause the entire result to vanish.  If two objects with similar curvature move across each other, the result will tend to flicker in and out of existence.</p>

<p>These techniques may suffice for straight lines, which require smaller epsilons, but they are wholly unsuited to the relative imprecision of parametric curves.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="embracing-the-uncertainty">embracing the uncertainty</h3>

<p>As the weeks passed, the errors uncovered by my tests went from feeling random to feeling malicious.  Floating point arithmetic may be deterministic, but as I watched my screen, waiting for the tests to fail, I imagined a demon in the FPU nudging the values as they flowed past, trying to move them beyond the threshold of self-consistency.</p>

<p>One day, I realized this was exactly the narrative behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">error-correcting codes</a>; we assume our data has been randomly altered en route, and we want to return it to a consistent state.  It didn’t seem like I could get it right the first time, so why not just fix it afterwards?</p>

<p>Consider the union of two ellipses:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-two-ellipses.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Ostensibly, there should only be three points of intersection, one on the left and two on the right.  But for the reasons described above, any intersection routine will likely find multiple points of intersection on the left as the curves converge on each other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-intersections.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The segments on the left are small enough, and thus imprecise enough, that our spatial intuition for the problem will just mislead us.  For this reason, it’s better to think of it as a graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-graph.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now we have to decide which edges to include, and which to exclude.  Since we’re trying to find the union, we want to keep any segments that are outside the other shape:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-valid-result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a well-formed result; there is a single cycle, and once we remove that cycle there are no leftover edges.  But we can’t rely on getting this lucky; the edges on the left might have succumbed to floating point error and believed they were both inside the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-incomplete.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is not a well-formed result; there are no cycles, and a bunch of leftover edges.  To make this consistent, we need to either close the loop, or remove the leftovers.  The cost of these changes is measured by the aggregate length of the edges we are adding or removing.</p>

<p>The minimal set of changes is equivalent to the shortest path between the dangling vertices.  Having found the path, we then invert the inclusion of every edge it passes through.  In this case, it passes through one of the edges we originally excluded, so we add that edge back in, and return the cycle we just created.</p>

<p>Alternately, both edges might think they are outside the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-redundant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, we have a complete cycle, but once we’ve extracted it there’s a single leftover edge:</p>

<p><img src="http://ideolalia.com/images/artifex-ellipses-leftover.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here again, we search through all the remaining edges for the shortest path between the two dangling vertices.  Since it passes through our leftover edge, we remove it.</p>

<p>Every floating point inconsistency will surface as one of these two cases, or some combination thereof.  By searching for the shortest path between the dangling edges, we find the smallest possible edit that will yield a consistent result.  Of course, a consistent result is not necessarily the <em>correct</em> one, but the fact that floating point errors tend to cluster around the smallest edges makes this a reasonable heuristic.  More importantly, it has weathered tens of millions of generative test cases without any issues.</p>

<p>A complete implementation of this algorithm can be found <a href="https://github.com/lacuna/artifex/blob/master/src/io/lacuna/artifex/utils/regions/Clip.java">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m not sure if this is a novel approach, but at the very least it represents a meaningful improvement on the state of the art in open source.  Intuitively, it feels like this might be a means to avoid epsilon hell in a wide range of geometric and numerical algorithms.  If anyone is aware of prior art in this vein, I’d be very interested to see it.</p>

<p>My work on the <a href="https://github.com/lacuna/artifex">Artifex</a> library is ongoing, but I hope it proves useful to others, and look forward to sharing my own projects that it will enable in the near future.</p>

  <p>How can we enable more science fiction to become reality?</p>
  <p><span>If you want to do something, it usually pays to study those who have done that thing successfully in the past. Asking </span><span>‘what is this outlier’s production function?’
    </span><span>can provide a starting point. </span></p>
  <p><span>DARPA is an outlier organization in the world of turning science fiction into reality. Since 1958, it has been a driving force in the creation of weather satellites, GPS, personal computers, modern robotics, the
      Internet, autonomous cars, and voice interfaces, to name a few. However, it is primarily limited to the domain of defense technology – there are DARPA-style ideas that are out of its scope. &nbsp;Which emulatable attributes contributed to
      DARPA’s outlier results? </span><span>What does a</span>&nbsp;domain-independent&nbsp;“ARPA Model” look like? <span>Is it possible to
      build other organizations that generate equally huge results in other domains by riffing on that model?</span></p>
  <p>Gallons of ink have been spilled describing <span>how</span><span>&nbsp;DARPA works</span><a id="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a><span>,
      but </span><span>in a nutshell here is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>how DARPA works.</span><span>&nbsp;Around 100 </span><span>program managers (PMs)</span><span>&nbsp;with ~5 year appointments create and run <span>programs</span> to pursue high-level visions like “actualize the idea of man-comp</span><span>uter symbiosis.” In these programs they fund researchers at universities and both
      big and small companies to do research </span><span>projects</span><span>&nbsp;of different sizes. Collectively, groups working on projects are called </span><span>performers</span>.&nbsp;Top-level
      authority lies with a <span>Director </span>who ultimately reports to the Secretary of Defense. </p>
  <p><span>DARPA has an incredibly powerful model for innovation in defense research, and I believe an abstract ‘<span>ARPA Model</span>’ could yield similar results in other domains. In this piece I’ll explain in detail why
      DARPA works. I’ll use that description to feel out and describe to the best of my ability a platonic ARPA Model. &nbsp;I’ll also distill some of the model’s implications for potential riffs on the model. Incidentally,
      I’m working on just such an imitator, and in future essays, I’ll explain why this model could be incredibly powerful when executed in a privately-funded context.</span></p>
  <h4>How to use this document</h4>
  
  <p>This document acts more like a collection of atomic notes than a tight essay – a DARPA-themed tapas if you will. The order of the sections is more of a guideline than a law so feel free to skip around. Throughout you will come across internal links that <a id="self-link" href="#self-link">look like this</a>.
    These links are an attempt to illustrate the interconnectedness of the ARPA Model.</p>
  <p><span>There are two stand-alone pieces to accomodate your time and interest:</span><span> a
    </span><span><a href="#distillation">distillation</a></span><span>, and the </span><span><a href="#h.nbyw8g2b67uk">full work</a></span><span>. </span><span>The
      distillation is meant to capture and compress the main points of the full work. Each section of the distillation internally links to the corresponding section one level deeper so if you want more info and nuance you can get it. </span></p>
      <p><span>I would rather this be read by a few people motivated to take action than by a broad audience who will find it merely interesting. In that vein, if you find yourself wanting to share this on Twitter or Hacker News, consider instead sharing it with one or two friends who will take action on it. Thank you for indulging me!</span></p>

PMs need to
      think for themselves and go up and down the ladder of abstraction in an unstructured environment. On top of that they need to be effective communicators and coordinators because so much of their jobs is building networks. There’s a
      pattern that the abstract qualities that make “great talent” in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty. Given that pattern, the people who would
      make good DARPA PMs would <span>also</span> make good hedge fund analysts, first employees at startups, etc. so digging into </span><span><a href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">people’s motivations for becoming a PM</a></span><span>&nbsp;is important. More precise details about what makes a PM good prevent you from going after the exact same people as every other high-variance industry. When ‘talent’ isn’t code for ‘specialized
      training’ it means the role or industry has not been systematized. Therefore, despite all the talk here and elsewhere about ‘the ARPA Model’ we must keep in mind that we may be attributing more structure to the process than
      actually exists.</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors">DARPA program managers pull control and risk away from both researchers and directors</a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;PMs pull control away
      from directors by having only one official checkpoint before launching programs and pull control away from performers through their ability to move money around quickly. PMs design programs to be high-risk aggregations of lower-risk projects.
      Only 5–10 out of every 100 programs successfully produce transformative research, while only 10% of projects are terminated early. Shifting the risk from the performers to the program managers enables DARPA to tackle </span><span>systemic </span><span>problems where other models cannot.</span></p><p><span><a href="#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases">The best program managers notice systemic biases and attack them. </a></span><span>For example, noticing that all of the finite element modeling literature
      assumes a locally static situation and asking ‘what if it was dynamic?’ </span><span>“The best program managers can get into the trees and still see the forest.”</span><span> Obviously, this
      quality is rather fuzzy but leads to two precise questions:</span></p>
  <ol ="1"="">
    <li><span>How do you find people who can uncover systemic biases in a discipline? </span></li>
    <li><span>How could you systematize finding systemic biases in a discipline?</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span>The first question suggests that you should seek out heretics and people with expertise who are not experts. The second question suggests building structured frameworks for mapping a discipline and its assumptions.
    </span></p><p><span><a href="#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building">A large part of a DARPA program manager’s job is focused network building</a></span><span>. </span><span>DARPA PMs network in the literal
      sense of creating networks, not just plugging into them. PMs meet disparate people working on ideas adjacent to the area in which they want to have an impact and bring them together in small workshops to dig into which possibilities are not
      impossible and what it would take to make them possible. The PMs host </span><span>performer days</span><span>&nbsp;— small private conferences for all the people working on different pieces of the program where
      performers can exchange ideas on what is working, what isn’t working, and build connections that don’t depend on the PM. </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a></span><a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a><span>&nbsp;is a
      paragon here. He brought together all the crazy people interested in human-focused computing. On top of that, &nbsp;he also helped create the first computer science lab groups. PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations –
      government, academia, startups, and large companies. These connections smooth the path for technologies to go from the lab to the shelf. </span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego">DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Why does this matter? When you are
      surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they’re saying because it’s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes against your priors. Thinking
      for yourself allows you to avoid these traps. PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to ask questions nobody else is asking. A large ego would lead to a program manager imposing
      their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of top down problems and bottom up solutions.</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers">DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There are legal provisions in place that
      let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. Hiring flexibility is important because PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand, so they may be unwilling to jump through hoops. Bureaucracies ensure consistency through
      rules – minimal bureaucracy means there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager so the principle that ‘A players hire A players and B players hire C players’ is incredibly important. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years">DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years.</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This transience is important for many reasons.
      Transience can inculcate PMs against the temptation to play it safe or play power games because there’s only one clear objective – make the program work. You’re out regardless of success or failure. Explicitly temporary roles can
      incentivize people with many options to join because they can have a huge impact, and then do something else. There’s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that
      will be. Regular program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.</span></p><p><span><a href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">Why do people become DARPA Program managers? </a></span>From a career and money standpoint, being a program manager seems pretty rough.<span>&nbsp;There are unique benefits though. It offers an outlet for people frustrated with the conservative nature of academia. The prospect of getting to control a lot of money without a ton of oversight appeals to some people.
      Patriotism is definitely a factor, and hard to replicate outside of a government. Being a PM can gain you the respect of a small, elite group of peers who will know what you did. Finally, there may be a particular technological vision they want
      to see out in the world and DARPA gives them the agency to make it happen in unique ways.</span></p>

When I started the Redis project more than ten years ago I was in one of the most exciting moments of my career. My co-founder and I had successfully launched two of the major web 2.0 services of the Italian web. In order to make them scalable we had to invent many new concepts, that were already known in the field most of the times, but we didn’t know, nor we cared to check. Problem? Let’s figure out a solution. We wanted to solve problems but we wanted, even more, to have fun. This was the playful environment where Redis was born. But now Redis is, incredibly, one of the main parts of so many things.

        <p>One line summary: Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">lru_cache decorator</a></p>

<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>

<p>If we’re calling expensive functions in the program very frequently, It’s best to save the result of a function call and use it for future purposes rather than calling function every time. This will generally speed up the execution of the program.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The expensiveness of function can be in terms of computational (CPU usage) or latency (disk read, fetching a resource from the network).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The saving result of function calls is generally referred to as caching. The naive way to do caching is to store every function calls. But, this doesn’t scale very well with the number of parameters of function and range of each parameter.</p>

<p>So, we need a smart way to do caching with a fixed amount of memory. And, there are plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies">caching strategies available</a> depending upon what type of information is available to us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caching is heavily used in plenty of areas from low-level (hardware/CPU) to high level (network/CDNs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most of the languages, We will choose caching strategies of our choice and implement them using a few data structures (hashmap, priority queue). Depending upon the language, It might take as little as few minutes to few hours to implement the generic solution of our need.</p>

<p>But, Python’s standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html">functools</a> already comes with one strategy of caching called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">LRU(Least Recently Used)</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators">decorators</a> in python, It only takes one line to integrate into the existing codebase</p>

<p>As, <strong>we can see the optimal cache size of fib function is 5</strong>. Increasing cache size will not result in much gain in terms of speedup.</p>

<h3 id="important-note">Important Note</h3>

<p>I strictly suggest to use lru decorator in only deterministic functions.</p>

<h4 id="deterministic-functions">Deterministic Functions</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. Deterministic algorithms are by far the most studied and familiar kind of algorithm, as well as one of the most practical, since they can be run on real machines efficiently.</p>

  <p>– Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>

  <p>– Phil Karlton</p>

    <p>A journey in fixing browser history
    </p></section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section>
    <p>
Promnesia is a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox/Firefox mobile) that serves as a web surfing copilot
by enhancing your browsing history, improving your web exploration experience, and integrating with your knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#readme">The repository</a> contains more information about the project and the setup guide, this post is more about the motivation and the story of what led me to work on it.
</p>
<p>
Also, you can quickly skim through the <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#demos">demos</a> first before reading, if you prefer!
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="singularity_when"><a href="#singularity_when">¶</a><span>1</span> I want my singularity!</h2>
<div id="text-singularity_when">
<p>
I was raised on science fiction and grew up dreaming about technology drastically changing our lives.
Artificial intelligence, augmenting the brain with a math co-processor, head-up displays, neural interfaces, having perfect reaction and memory – many of you are on the same page and know the drill.
</p>
<p>
Years passed, I became a software engineer, and realized just how far we are from all these fancy technologies I wanted.
So my aspirations have become more modest, and I've chosen a more realistic and plausible target:
using my digital trace (such as browser history, webpage annotations and my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>) to make up for my limited memory.
</p>
<p>
I'm exploring lots of information on the Internet, and it feels wasteful to use my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#meatsack">meat resources</a> to keep track of it.
Meanwhile, web browsers keep a record automatically, without any manual and conscious effort.
Surely we can benefit from the immense computing power and memory capabilities of computers?
</p>
<p>
So I figured that I wanted:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what_i_want"><a href="#what_i_want">¶</a><span>2</span> Ok, maybe a web assistant at least?</h2>
<div id="text-what_i_want">
<p>
A web surfing companion. A copilot.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.
A <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html">Remembrance Agent</a>?
</p>
<p>
Call it whatever you like, I <i>wish</i> it were a concept with a widely accepted name. Something that will sit in my browser and:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
aid me with <b>information processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Keep track of what I've read, when, on which device, and for how long.
</p></li>
<li><p>
show me my <b>annotations and highlights</b>, within the original page
</p>
<p>
I don't want to keep wondering whether I have my notes and thoughts stashed in some app, I want the computer to let me know instead.
</p></li>
<li><p>
unify my <b>scattered and siloed bookmarks</b>
</p>
<p>
Firefox bookmarks; Reddit/Hackernews saves; "Watch later" on Youtube, saved links in my instant messenger.
</p>
<p>
These are the same damn thing, yet there is no way to oversee and process them through a single interface.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jborichevskiy.com/posts/digital-tools/#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">"Queue management for inbound digital content"</a>:
a post expanding further on this idea.
</p></li>
<li><p>
connect with my online presence: chats and social networks
</p>
<p>
If I tweeted about a page, surely this should be somehow recorded in the browsing history?
</p>
<p>
In fact, the page that I bothered to tweet about is <b>much</b> more important than a page I merely visited in the browser.
</p></li>
<li><p>
help me explore new information and <b>prioritize</b> it
</p>
<p>
There is so much awesome stuff on the Internet! The biggest problem I have is picking the next cool link to dig into.
</p>
<p>
Imagine if in one click, I could see which of my friends, or the people I follow have read a certain link.
What did they think? Have they posted about it, annotated, or something else? Do they follow the author, perhaps I should too?
</p></li>
<li><p>
bridge the gap between the browser and my <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#exobrain">personal wiki</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever product I choose for managing my notes: Google Keep, Evernote, Roam Research, or even org-mode files on my disk,
they always end up <b>isolated and disconnected</b> from my web browsing.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I searched for a system like this <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/767412935316611072">for</a> several <a href="https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/896313846159298560">years</a>.
</p>
<p>
After enough failed attempts at finding an <a href="#prior_art">existing solution</a>, I figured it was going to be yet another thing I'd have to implement myself.
</p>
<p>
The journey of building it took longer than I expected, led me through a rabbit hole of <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a>, lots of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>,
and made me realize: <b>browser history is very, very broken</b>.
</p>
<p>
Note: the next two sections are (somewhat technical) rants. If you prefer a more positive/less boring agenda, feel free to skip them straight to <a href="#prior_art">"Existing solutions"</a>
, and you can return back later if you feel like it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="history_broken"><a href="#history_broken">¶</a><span>3</span> Browser history is broken</h2>
<div id="text-history_broken">
<p>
To a large extent, URLs express <b>relationships and hierarchy</b> between the bits of information. For example:  <code>blog &lt;-&gt; post &lt;-&gt; comment</code>, <code>person &lt;-&gt; tweet</code>, <code>playlist &lt;-&gt; video</code>.
</p>
<p>
With this information you should be easily able to find everything relevant to the current page and trace your jumps through past websites.
Merely by looking at URLs, without "AI" or some dubious machine learning algorithm!
Seems like a low hanging fruit to harvest, right?
</p>
<p>
Web browser history is a rich source of potentially useful information.
Just think about it: it's zero effort <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a>.
It contains exact timestamps and links which <i>basically</i> address information.
</p>
<p>
Now think about the experience you actually have. What was the last time you used the browser history in any nontrivial way, for something other than reopening an accidentally closed tab?
</p>
<p>
Besides:

<div id="text-not_just_browser">

When you're using a native phone app (say, for Reddit or Twitter), your history either isn't logged anywhere or if it is, it's only stored locally on your phone.

</span></p></div>
<div><p><span>
On Android, it's likely to be in an Sqlite database in <code>/data/data/app.name</code>.
This directory is not accessible to normal users <b>unless your phone is rooted</b>.
Just think about how ridiculous this is. It's <b>your own data</b>, yet your OS babysits you, preventing access to it.

And yes, I know sandboxing and security are important, but locking my data inside the app is hardly an acceptable tradeoff.
</span></p></div>
<p>
As a specific example, the <a href="https://github.com/ccrama/Slide">Reddit Slide</a> app keeps your view history in <code>/data/data/me.ccrama.redditslide/SEEN</code>.
Okay, say you root your phone and access the database. Turns out the the app isn't persisting the data forever, it's merely keeping a few weeks' cache.
And I can hardly blame the developer for this: because of the data model, no one expects regular users to access this database.
</p>
<p>
So if you want your complete history, you have to backup this database regularly, keep the snapshots and <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/exports.html#synthetic">somehow</a>
reconstruct it.
</p>
<p>
You may dismiss this as nitpicking and obsession over every last bit of my data.
But when <b>all</b> of your phone apps are doing this you're missing out on quite a lot of useful information.

<p>
A slightly better scenario, but as far as the web browser is concerned, it doesn't make any difference.

<p>
Even <i>regular</i> browser history is not easy to get:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1080942">used to</a> silently 'expire' your browser history</li>

Chrome deletes history older than <a href="https://superuser.com/a/364475/300795">90 days</a>

<p>
The only way to access older history I'm aware of is <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/">Google Activity</a> and Takeout.
</p></li>
<li>Google Takeout <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/takeout-data-gone.html">quietly recycles your history</a></li>
<li><p>
Migration is limited to the most popular browsers
</p>
<p>
The retention limits the migration as well.
E.g. if you migrate from Chrome to Firefox, history older than 90 days is locked and siloed in your Google Account.

<li><p>
You're going to have a hard time if you're not using Google/Mozilla sync
</p>
<p>
Your history will be scattered across devices and lost on OS reinstalls.

There are ways of self-hosting Firefox sync, and (<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/614744/how-to-set-up-a-own-chrome-sync-server">allegedly</a>) even Chrome sync,
but as you can imagine, is quite tedious.

This topic probably deserves a separate post, but I'll keep it section-sized for now.
</p>
<p>
URLs might seem great because they mostly address content and are semi-descriptive: people <i>try</i> to keep URLs somewhat reasonable, tidy and working.
But in the real world:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
links <b>rot</b>

<p>
Many URLs are <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs#link-rot"><b>literally</b> broken</a>.
We're lucky to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/">archive.org</a>, so you can at least access dead pages.
</p>
<p>
But there is no way to migrate your browser history, e.g. point old URLs to their respective archive.org entries or a new domain.
Similarly if you had the page annotated, your annotations become orphans without an easy way to relink them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obfuscated</b> by shortening and redirects
</p>
<div><p><span>
What happens to all the <code>t.co</code> links when Twitter as a service dies?

</span></p></div></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>obscured</b>
</p>
<p>
There is no easy way to know what's behind <code>https://www.instapaper.com/read/1265139707</code> without querying the Instapaper API.
</p>
<p>
Relations between data are often obscured as well. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918980</code> is a submission link</li>
<li><code>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22919718</code> is a comment to that submission</li>
</ul>
<p>
These links are clearly related, but there is no way to tell it just from <samp>id</samp>.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to Reddit links:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is</code> is a post link</li>
<li><code>https://reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/g6ejwe/is_there_an_orgmode_workbook_tutorial_that_is/fo9qnen</code> is a comment to that post</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ids are obscure, but at least we can clearly see the <code>post &lt;-&gt; comment</code> relation merely by looking at the URLs.
Alas, browsers are just ignoring this useful information.
</p></li>
<li><p>
links are <b>unstandardized</b>
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">queries</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>typically don't point to anything persistent and are used for querying (duh)</li>
<li>but other times they are used to address information: <code>http://wiki.c2.com/?LispLanguage</code> or <code>https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2694</code></li>
<li>and in many cases are utter garbage used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Tracking">tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The worst part is that these use cases overlap. For example, take a look at <code>youtube.com/watch?v=wHrCkyoe72U&amp;feature=share&amp;t…</code></p></li></ul></div></div></section></article></div>

June 28, 2020 | https://adamham.dev/posts/producing-a-deepfake-on-aws/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adamham.dev/posts/producing-a-deepfake-on-aws/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a music video project I worked on we had to produce a deep fake. I had previously made some attempts at deepfakes using a local machine with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080. Now I'll be using a MacBook Pro and an AWS account with a generous credit (the running cost of the server only ended up being about $30 per 24 hours).</p>
<p>If you want to understand more about how machine learning works I would recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo">this video</a>.</p>
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>The first thing was to choose a library, the two main players in the open-source deepfake space are <a href="https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap">Faceswap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a>. I chose to go with Faceswap because the GUI and the CLI seemed more user-friendly to me, it supports multiple GPUs, has a solid workflow and great community and support.</p>
<p>I had originally planned to do the inital tests on my local machine but my MacBook Pro has an ATI graphics card 🥺. So straight to the cloud I go... I used a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/">g4dn.xlarge EC2 instance</a> and loaded it with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/">AWS Deep Learning AMI</a>. After wrestling with the <a href="https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation of faceswap</a> (had some dependancy issues that may have been related to using the deep learning AMI) I managed to get it up and running on the remote instance.</p>
<h3>Preliminary tests</h3>
<p>To start we did a test run first to see what kind of results we could get using mostly default settings and with minimal intervention, just to get an idea of what was really possible with our material. For this I used the same footage for Face A from the target video that I wanted to convert, and for Face B I recorded 60 seconds of the subject performing basic facial movements from different angles.</p>
<p>From the preliminary results I could identify what the parameters that I was working within were. I noticed that a lot of my faces are a profile view, deepfakes work much better with a frontal view. Also my source material is a very low resolution (480p YouTube rip of an 80s video). This makes faces harder to detect, particularly smaller faces.</p>
<p>I would highly suggest doing a few tests before fully training your model. It'll also help you to tell which angles and expressions are lacking from your source footage.</p>
<h3>Project structure</h3>
<p>My initial tests also encouraged me to define a folder structure, I found this to be an efficient structure for deepfake projects</p>

        <deckgo-highlight-code>
          <code slot="code">/my-project
/my-project/src
/my-project/src/faceA/              // - Source footage/images for Face A
/my-project/src/faceB/              // - "                       " Face B
/my-project/src/target/             // - Footage to convert
/my-project/extract/faceA           // - Extracted faces from Face A
/my-project/extract/faceB           // - "                  " Face B
/my-project/model/                  // - Trained model
/my-project/output/                 // - Converted media (final exports)</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
      
<h2>1. Extract</h2>
<h3>Face A - 6586 faces extracted</h3>
<p>I used 3 video clips of Robin Gibb that I could find from that era and cut out the footage that was worth extracting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-U058BIAGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-U058BIAGo</a> <strong>(This is also the target video)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMvRLLPd8Ak">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMvRLLPd8Ak</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Nykcs7Zhg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Nykcs7Zhg</a></p>
<h3>Face B - 7382 faces extracted</h3>
<p>I recorded 5 minutes of footage of the subject replicating the facial movements from the target source.</p>
<p>To prepare the extracted faces for training they need to be cleaned up. The better your source material is the better your result will be. This part of the process took about 10 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove any extracted faces that are of poor quality</li>
<li>Remove any bad detected faces</li>
<li>Regenerate alignments file to remove the deleted faces</li>
<li>Manually go through each face and clean up the alignment</li>
<li>Generate new masks</li>
</ul>
<p>After extracting the faces to use for training I cleaned and sorted the faces to remove any poor quality faces or things that were detected by error. Faceswap actually has a tool to allow you to sort the extracted faces by relevance to help you filter them out. After deleting the bad faces you'll also need to remove them from your alignments file using the alignments tool.</p>
<h2>2. Train</h2>
<p>There are a few different types of models you can train it all depends on what material you have and the results you want to achieve. I had time and computing power on my side so I decided to launch 3 instances and train variations of models to 20,000 iterations and then select the best one from there. I chose to go with Dfaker using a VCC-Clear mask.</p>
<p>Note: I made an error and accidentally deleted the full timelapse permanently but I have a few captures here for demo purposes. The final model was much more defined than shown in this timelapse.</p>
<p>My final model was trained for 75,000 iterations. I started it again and ran it for another 10,000 where I could see that the loss level was not improving, therefore the model was no longer learning and I could conclude that my model was trained.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamham.dev/posts/producing-a-deepfake-on-aws/training.gif" alt="Timelapse of model being trained in faceswap"></p>
<h2>3. Convert</h2>
<p>To prepare the target footage to be converted we need to repeat step 1 (extract) again being as meticulous as possible with the alignments. I spent about 4 hours on ~4,100 frames to achieve my result.</p>
<p>I definitely ran into difficulties with the face detection because of the low resolution of my source footage.</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<h3>Converted Video</h3>
<p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sqc8EvnyyBM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  </p>
<h3>Original Video</h3>
<p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-U058BIAGo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  </p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>The abilities of the technology is really hyped up in the media. To achieve an undetectable result you really do need source footage that fits into the parameters of what a deepfake can work with.</p>
<p>For this project the aim wasn't to have a perfectly undetectable deepfake, the limitations weren't a problem but infact contributed to the concept. The song is a cover and seeing artifacts from the deepfake reinforces this idea.</p>
<p>The cost of processing the deepfake on AWS comes at about $30 per day. If you were doing a couple of renders a year then it's an amazing option rather than using your own hardware. However, things like manual alignments are really tricky using a remote machine so ideally you would want to have a CUDA capable graphics card in your local. A dedicated graphics machine with comparable specs would start at about $1400 (about 46 days of AWS EC2 usage) plus electricity bills.</p></div></div>]]>

<h4><em><strong>This will be a chapter in my upcoming book “Functional MRI” </strong><strong>in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series&nbsp;</strong></em></h4>
<hr>
<p>Functional MRI is unique in that, in spite of being almost 30 years old as a method, it continues to progress in terms of sophistication of acquisition, hardware, processing, in our understanding of the signal itself. There has been no plateau in any of these areas. In fact, by looking at the literature, one gets the impression that this advancement is accelerating. Every new advance opens the potential range where it might have an impact, allowing new questions about the brain to be addressed.</p>
<p>In spite of its success – perhaps as a result of its success – it has had its share of controversies coincident with methods advancements, new observations, and novel applications. Some controversies have been more contentious than others. Over the years, I’ve been following these controversies and have at times performed research to resolve them or at least better understand them. A good controversy can help to move the field forward as it can focus and motivate groups of people to work on the issue itself, shedding a broader light on the field as these are overcome.</p>
<p>While a few of the controversies or issues of contention have been fully resolved, most remain to some degree unresolved. Understanding fMRI through its controversies allows a deeper appreciation for how the field advances as a whole – and how science really works – the false starts, the corrections, and the various claims made by those with potentially useful pulse sequences, processing methods, or applications. Below is the list of twenty-six major controversies in fMRI – in approximately chronological order.</p>
<h2>#1: The Neurovascular coupling debate.</h2>
<p>Since the late 1800’s, the general consensus, hypothesized by Roy and Sherrington in 1890 (1), was that activation-induced cerebral flow changes were driven by local changes in metabolic demand. In 1986, a publication by Fox et al. (2)challenged that view, demonstrating that with activation, localized blood flow seemingly increased beyond oxidative metabolic demand, suggesting an “uncoupling” of the hemodynamic response from metabolic demand during activation. Many, including Louis Sokolof, a well-established neurophysiologist at the National Institutes of Health, strongly debated the results. Fox nicely describes this period in history from his perspective in “The coupling controversy” (3).</p>
<p>I remember well, in the early days of fMRI, Dr. Sokolof standing up from the audience to debate Fox on several circumstances, arguing that the flow response should match the metabolic need and there should be no change in oxygenation. He argued that what we are seeing in fMRI is something other than an oxygenation change.</p>
<p>In the pre-fMRI days, I recall not knowing what direction the signal should go – as when I first laid eyes on the impactful video presented by Tom Brady during his plenary lecture on the future of MRI at the Society for Magnetic Resonance (SMR) Meeting in August of 1991, it was not clear from these time series movies of subtracted images the direction he performed the subtraction operation. Was it task minus rest or rest minus task? Did the signal go up or down with activation? I also remember very well, analyzing my first fMRI experiments, expecting to see a decrease in BOLD signal – as Ogawa, in an earlier paper(4), hypothesized that metabolic rate increases would lead to a decrease blood oxygenation thus a darkening of the BOLD signal during brain activation. Instead, all I saw were signal increases. It was Fox’s work that helped me to understand why the BOLD signal should <em>increase</em>with activation. Flow goes up and oxygen delivery exceeds metabolic need, leading to an increase in blood oxygenation.</p>
<p>While models of neurovascular coupling have improved, we still do not understand the precise need for flow increases. First, we had the “watering the whole garden to feed one thirsty flower” hypothesis which suggested that flow increases matched metabolic need for one area but since vascular control was coarse, the abundant oxygenation was delivered to a wider area than was needed, causing the increase in oxygenation. We also had the “diffusion limited” model, where it was hypothesized that in order to deliver enough oxygen to the furthest neurons from the oxygen supplying vessels, an overabundance of oxygen was needed at the vessel itself since the decrease of oxygen as it diffused from the vessel to the furthest cell was described as an exponential. &nbsp;This theory has fallen a bit from favor as the increases in CMRO<sub>2</sub>or the degree to which the diffusion of oxygen to tissue from blood is limited tend to be higher than physiologic measures. The alternative to the metabolic need hypothesis involves neurogenic “feed-forward” hypotheses – which still doesn’t get at the “why” of the flow response.</p>
<p>Currently, this is where the field stands. We know that the flow response is robust and consistent. We know that in active areas, oxygenation in healthy brains always increases, however we just don’t understand specifically why it’s necessary. Is it a neurogenic, metabolic, or some other mechanism to satisfy some evolutionary critical need that extends beyond simple need for more oxygen? We are still figuring that out. Nevertheless, it can be said that whatever the reason for this increase in flow, it is fundamentally important, as the BOLD response is stunningly consistent.</p>
<h2>#2: The Draining Vein Effect</h2>
<p>The question: “what about the draining veins?” I think was first posited at an early fMRI conference by Kamil Ugurbil of the University of Minnesota. Here and for the next several years he alerted the community to the observation that, especially at low field, draining veins are a problem as they smear and distort the fMRI signal change such that it’s hard to know specifically where the underlying neuronal activation is with a high degree of certainty. In the “20 years of fMRI: the science and the stories” special issue of NeuroImage, Ravi Menon writes a thorough narrative of the “Great brain vs vein” debate (5). &nbsp;When the first fMRI papers were published, only one, by Ogawa et al. (6), was at high field – 4 Tesla – and relatively high resolution. In Ogawa’s paper, it was shown that there was a differentiation between veins (very hot spots) and capillaries (more diffuse weaker activation in grey matter). Ravi followed this up with another paper (7)using multi-echo imaging, to show that blood in veins had an intrinsically shorter T2* decay than gray matter at 4T and appeared as dark dots in T2* weighted structural images yet appeared as bright functional hot spots in the 4T functional images. Because of the low SNR and CNR at 1.5T, allowing only the strongest BOLD effects to be seen, and because models suggested that at low field strengths, large vessels contributed the most to the signal, the field worried that all fMRI was looking at was veins – at least at 1.5T.</p>
<p>The problem of large vein effects is prevalent using standard gradient-echo EPI – even at high fields. Simply put, the BOLD signal is directly proportional to the venous blood volume contribution in each voxel. If the venous blood volume is high – as with the case of a vein filling a voxel – then the potential for high BOLD changes is high if there is a blood oxygenation change in the area. At high field, indeed, there is not much intravascular signal left in T2* weighted Gradient-echo sequences, however, the extravascular effect of large vessels still exists.&nbsp; Spin-echo sequences (sensitive to small compartments) still are sensitive to the susceptibility effects around intravascular red blood cells within large vessels – even at 7T where intravascular contribution is reduced. Even with some vein sensitivity, promising high resolution orientation column results have been produced at 7T using gradient-echo and spin-echo sequences (8). The use of arterial spin labeling has potential as a method insensitive to large veins, although the temporal efficiency, intrinsic sensitivity, and brain coverage limitations blunt its utility. Vascular Space Occupancy (VASO), a method sensitive to blood volume changes, has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to blood volume changes in small vessels and capillaries. Preliminary results have shown clear layer dependent activation using VASO where other approaches have provided less clear delineation(9).</p>
<p>Methods have arisen to identify and mask large vein effects – including thresholding based on percent signal change (large veins tend to fill voxels and thus exhibit a larger fractional signal change), as well as temporal fluctuations (large veins are pulsatile thus exhibit more magnitude and phase noise). While these seem to be workable solutions, they have not been picked up and used extensively. With regard to using the phase variations as a regressor to eliminate pulsatile blood and tissue, perhaps the primary reason for this not being adopted is because standard scanners do not produce these images readily, thus users do not have easy access to this information.</p>
<p>The draining vein issue is least problematic at voxel sizes larger than 2mm, as at these resolutions, mostly the region of activation- as defined as &gt;1 cm “blob” is used and interpreted. Other than enhancing the magnitude of activation, vein effects do not distort these “blobs” thus are typically of no …</p></div></article></div>

    <small>Published on 22. June 2020</small>
    <p>I was looking for an alternative to Google Analytics to track visitors on a website. Analytics (and most of its competitors) provide detailed information and real-time data at the cost of privacy. Google can track you across sites using a bunch of different techniques and through their Chrome browser. Combined, this can be assembled to a detailed profile that can not only be used for tracking, but for marketing too.</p><p>I found some (open source) alternatives like <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GoatCounter</a>, which anonymously collect data without invading the user's privacy. But all of the tools I found either rely on cookies, which the visitor needs to opt-in for or cost money for the server-side only tracking solution. While I'm willing to pay for good software, especially when it comes from a small team or just one developer, I was wondering if I could build something that I can integrate into my Go applications.</p><p>This post is about my solution called <em>Pirsch</em>, an open-source Go library that can be integrated into your applications to tracks visitors on the server-side, without setting cookies. I will write about the technique used and what the advantages and disadvantages are.</p><blockquote><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>Invading the privacy of your website visitors is evil. Pirsch is a privacy-focused tracking library for Go that can be integrated into your applications. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/emvi/pirsch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>!</p><p>You can find a live demo <a href="https://marvinblum.de/tracking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> on my website and the whole thing on GitHub as a <a href="https://github.com/Kugelschieber/marvinblum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sample application</a>.</p></blockquote><h2>What's With the Name?</h2><p>Pirsch is German and refers to a special kind of hunt:&nbsp;<em>the hunter carefully and quietly enters the area to be hunted, he stalks against the wind in order to get as close as possible to the prey without being noticed.</em></p><p>I found this quite fitting for a tracking library that cannot be blocked by the visitor. Even though it sounds a little sneaky. Here is the Gopher for it create by <a href="https://github.com/Motorschpocht" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Daniel</a>.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/0wV4YBIYaCm9JiteSaa3.svg" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/0wV4YBIYaCm9JiteSaa3.svg"><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>I will go over each step in more detail later, but here is a high-level overview of how Pirsch tracks visitors.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/vuvopEa9M7yGpKWgwXht.svg" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/vuvopEa9M7yGpKWgwXht.svg"><p>Once someone visits your website, the HTTP handler calls Pirsch to store a new hit and goes on with whatever it intends to do. Pirsch will do its best to filter out bots, calculate a fingerprint, and stores the page hit. You can analyze the data and generate statistics from it later.</p><p>The process must be triggered manually by calling the <code>Hit</code> method and passing the <code>http.Request</code>. This enables you to decide which traffic is tracked and which is not. I'm usually just interested in page visits, so I'll add a call to Pirsch inside my page handlers. Resources are served on a different endpoint and won't be tracked that way.</p><h3>Fingerprinting</h3><p>Fingerprinting is a technique to identify individual devices by combing some parameters. The parameters are typically things like the graphics card ID and other variables that are unique to a device. As we are interested in tracking website traffic, we won't have access to this kind of information. Instead, we can make use of the IP and HTTP protocol. Here are the parameters used by Pirsch to generate a fingerprint:</p><ul><li><p>the IP is the most obvious choice. It might change, as ISPs only have a limited pool of IPs available to them, but that shouldn't happen too frequently</p></li><li><p>the User-Agent HTTP header contains information about the browser and device used by the visitor. It might not be filled though, but it usually is</p></li></ul><p>To generate a unique fingerprint from this information, we can calculate a hash. Pirsch will add the current day to prevent tracking users across days and calculate an MD5 hash. I found this to be the fastest algorithm available in the Go standard library. This will also make the visitor anonymous at the same time as we do not store IPs or other identifiable information.</p><p>This method is called <em>passive</em> fingerprinting, as we're only using data that we have access to anyways. The alternative is called <em>active</em> fingerprinting, which makes use of JavaScript to collect additional information on the client-side and sends it to the backend. But as we're trying to build a privacy-focus tracking solution, passive fingerprinting is the way to go.</p><p>We will use the fingerprint later to count unique visitors.</p><h3>Filtering Bots</h3><p>Filtering out bot traffic is hard, as there is no complete list of all bots and they won't send any special kind of information, like an <em>I'm a bot</em> header. All we can do is to process the IP and the User-Agent header send and make some assumptions. Pirsch will look for terms often used by bots within the User-Agent header. Should it contain words like <em>bot</em> or <em>crawler</em> or an URL, the hit will be dropped. Filtering for IP ranges is not implemented (yet), but you can filter hits that are coming from popular IP ranges, like AWS.</p><h3>Hits</h3><p>Each page request is stored as a <em>Hit</em>. A hit is a data point that can later be analyzed. Here is the definition of a hit:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// I removed some details to make it more readable for this blog post
type Hit struct {
	Fingerprint string
	Path        string
	URL         string
	Language    string
	UserAgent   string
	Ref         string
	Time        time.Time
}</code></pre><p>A hit contains the full request URL, the path extracted from the URL, the language, user-agent and reference passed by the client in their corresponding headers and the time the request was made.</p><h3>Analyze</h3><p>Pirsch provides an <em>Analyzer</em> that can be used to extract some basic statistics:</p><ul><li><p>total visitor count</p></li><li><p>visitors by page on each day</p></li><li><p>visitors by hour on each day</p></li><li><p>languages used by visitors</p></li><li><p>active visitors within a time frame</p></li></ul><p>Most of these functions accept a filter to specify a time frame. The data can then be plotted like on my <a href="https://marvinblum.de/tracking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tracking page</a>.</p><img src="https://marvinblum.de/static/blog/OxdzmGZ1Bl/QOeMcMKi8yS2p4WB2Xlu.png" alt="https://api.emvi.com/api/v1/content/QOeMcMKi8yS2p4WB2Xlu.png"><p>To reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed the hits get aggregated each night and hits are cleaned up afterward.</p><p>Postgres is used as the storage backend at the moment as it is a fantastic open-source database and provides all features needed to read these statistics easily. You can extract more statistics, like the visitor page flow, from the database if you care.</p><h3>Tracking From JavaScript</h3><p>While it is simple to integrate tracking into your backend, you might also want to have some way to track from your frontend as well, in case you're running a single page application for example. In that case, you can add an endpoint to your router and call it using Ajax. The path can manually be overwritten in Pirsch by calling <em>HitPage</em> instead of <em>Hit</em>.</p><h2>How Well Does It Work?</h2><p>As far as I can tell right now, it works pretty well. I still need to collect more sample data and a way to compare it to something like Google Analytics in order to make a more precise statement. Keep in mind that while Analytics and other tools provide more detailed statistics, like the location, age, gender, and so on, they can be blocked by tools like uBlock. Pirsch cannot be blocked by the client and therefore it can track visitors you won't even notice with a client-side solution.</p><p>Bots are probably the weak spot of Pirsch right now, as filtering for them requires adding a whole bunch of keywords to the filter list.</p><p>Another disadvantage of server-side tracking depending on your use-case  might be that you cannot track your marketing campaigns. In case you're using Adsense for marketing, you can track how well your campaigns perform through Analytics. This won't work with Pirsch.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Tracking on the server-side isn't too hard to archive and all in all, I think it's worth the effort. I hope you gained some insight into how you can use fingerprinting and Pirsch to your advantage. I will continue improving Pirsch and implement it into <a href="https://emvi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emvi</a> and compare the output to Analytics. I might also add a user interface for Pirsch so that you can host it without integrating it into your application and without the need to generate the charts yourself. In case you would like to send me feedback, have a question, or would like to contribute you can contact me.</p>

run a program which calls <code>open</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> (and many others) you are making a system call.</p><p>System calls are how a program enters the kernel to perform some task. Programs use system calls to perform a variety of operations such as: creating processes, doing network and file IO, and much more.</p><p>You can find a list of system calls by checking the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html">man page for syscalls(2)</a>.</p><p>There are several different ways for user programs to make system calls and the low-level instructions for making a system call vary among CPU architectures.</p><p>As an application developer, you don’t typically need to think about how exactly a system call is made. You simply include the appropriate header file and make the call as if it were a normal function.</p><p><code>glibc</code> provides wrapper code which abstracts you away from the underlying code which arranges the arguments you’ve passed and enters the kernel.</p><p>Before we can dive into the details of how system calls are made, we’ll need to define some terms and examine some core ideas that will appear later.</p><h2 id="hardware-and-software">Hardware and software</h2><p>This blog post makes the following assumptions that:</p><ul><li>You are using a 32-bit or 64-bit Intel or AMD CPU. The discussion about the methods may be useful for people using other systems, but the code samples below contain CPU-specific code.</li><li>You are interested in the Linux kernel, version 3.13.0. Other kernel versions will be similar, but the exact line numbers, organization of code, and file paths will vary. Links to the 3.13.0 kernel source tree on GitHub are provided.</li><li>You are interested in <code>glibc</code> or <code>glibc</code> derived libc implementations (e.g., <code>eglibc</code>).</li></ul><p>x86-64 in this blog post will refer to 64bit Intel and AMD CPUs that are based on the x86 architecture.</p><h2 id="user-programs-the-kernel-and-cpu-privilege-levels">User programs, the kernel, and CPU privilege levels</h2><p>User programs (like your editor, terminal, ssh daemon, etc) need to interact with the Linux kernel so that the kernel can perform a set of operations on behalf of your user programs that they can’t perform themselves.</p><p>For example, if a user program needs to do some sort of IO (<code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, etc) or modify its address space (<code>mmap</code>, <code>sbrk</code>, etc) it must trigger the kernel to run to complete those actions on its behalf.</p><p>What prevents user programs from performing these actions themselves?</p><p>It turns out that the x86-64 CPUs have a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_level">privilege levels</a>. Privilege levels are a complex topic suitable for their own blog post. For the purposes of this post, we can (greatly) simplify the concept of privilege levels by saying:</p><ol><li>Privilege levels are a means of access control. The current privilege level determines which CPU instructions and IO may be performed.</li><li>The kernel runs at the most privileged level, called “Ring 0”. User programs run at a lesser level, typically “Ring 3”.</li></ol><p>In order for a user program to perform some privileged operation, it must cause a privilege level change (from “Ring 3” to “Ring 0”) so that the kernel can execute.</p><p>There are several ways to cause a privilege level change and trigger the kernel to perform some action.</p><p>Let’s start with a common way to cause the kernel to execute: interrupts.</p><h2 id="interrupts">Interrupts</h2><p>You can think of an interrupt as an event that is generated (or “raised”) by hardware or software.</p><p>A hardware interrupt is raised by a hardware device to notify the kernel that a particular event has occurred. A common example of this type of interrupt is an interrupt generated when a NIC receives a packet.</p><p>A software interrupt is raised by executing a piece of code. On x86-64 systems, a software interrupt can be raised by executing the <code>int</code> instruction.</p><p>Interrupts usually have numbers assigned to them. Some of these interrupt numbers have a special meaning.</p><p>You can imagine an array that lives in memory on the CPU. Each entry in this array maps to an interrupt number. Each entry contains the address of a function that the CPU will begin executing when that interrupt is received along with some options, like what privilege level the interrupt handler function should be executed in.</p><p>Here’s a photo from the Intel CPU manual showing the layout of an entry in this array:</p><p><img src="https://blog.packagecloud.io/images/idt.png" alt="Screenshot of Interrupt Descriptor Table entry diagram for x86_64 CPUs"></p><p>If you look closely at the diagram, you can see a 2-bit field labeled DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level). The value in this field determines the minimum privilege level the CPU will be in when the handler function is executed.</p><p>This is how the CPU knows which address it should execute when a particular type of event is received and what privilege level the handler for that event should execute in.</p><p>In practice, there are lots of different ways to deal with interrupts on x86-64 systems. If you are interested in learning more read about the <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC">8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller</a>, <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/APIC">Advanced Interrupt Controllers</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/IOAPIC">IO Advanced Interrupt Controllers</a>.</p><p>There are other complexities involved with dealing with both hardware and software interrupts, such as interrupt number collisions and remapping.</p><p>We don’t need to concern ourselves with these details for this discussion about system calls.</p><h2 id="model-specific-registers-msrs">Model Specific Registers (MSRs)</h2><p>Model Specific Registers (also known as MSRs) are control registers that have a specific purpose to control certain features of the CPU. The CPU documentation lists the addresses of each of the MSRs.</p><p>You can use the CPU instructions <code>rdmsr</code> to <code>wrmsr</code> to read and write MSRs, respectively.</p><p>There are also command line tools which allow you to read and write MSRs, but doing this is <em>not recommended</em> as changing these values (especially while a system is running) is dangerous unless you are really careful.</p><p>If you don’t mind potentially destabilizing your system or irreversibly corrupting your data, you can read and write MSRs by installing <code>msr-tools</code> and loading the <code>msr</code> kernel module:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="sh">% <span>sudo </span>apt-get install msr-tools
% <span>sudo </span>modprobe msr
% <span>sudo </span>rdmsr</code></pre></figure><p>Some of the system call methods we’ll see later make use of MSRs, as we’ll see soon.</p><h2 id="calling-system-calls-with-assembly-is-a-bad-idea">Calling system calls with assembly is a bad idea</h2><p>It’s not a great idea to call system calls by writing your own assembly code.</p><p>One big reason for this is that some system calls have additional code that runs in glibc before or after the system call runs.</p><p>In the examples below, we’ll be using the <code>exit</code> system call. It turns out that you can register functions to run when <code>exit</code> is called by a program by using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html"><code>atexit</code></a>.</p><p>Those functions are called from glibc, not the kernel. So, if you write your own assembly to call <code>exit</code> as we show below, your registered handler functions won’t be executed since you are bypassing glibc.</p><p>Nevertheless, manually making system calls with assembly is a good learning experience.</p><div><p>Create a package repository in less than 10 seconds, free.</p></div><p>Using our prerequisite knowledge we know two things:</p><ol><li>We know that we can trigger the kernel to execute by generating a software interrupt.</li><li>We can generate a software interrupt with the <code>int</code> assembly instruction.</li></ol><p>Combining these two concepts leads us to the legacy system call interface on Linux.</p><p>The Linux kernel sets aside a specific software interrupt number that can be used by user space programs to enter the kernel and execute a system call.</p><p>The Linux kernel registers an interrupt handler named <code>ia32_syscall</code> for the interrupt number: 128 (0x80). Let’s take a look at the code that actually does this.</p><p>From the <code>trap_init</code> function in the kernel 3.13.0 source in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L770"><code>arch/x86/kernel/traps.c</code></a>:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>__init</span> <span>trap_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

The arguments for the syscall itself are to be placed in the remaining general purpose registers.</p><p>One place this is documented is in a comment in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S#L378-L397"><code>arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S</code></a>:</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="c"> <span>*</span> <span>Emulated</span> <span>IA32</span> <span>system</span> <span>calls</span> <span>via</span> <span>int</span> <span>0x80</span><span>.</span>

But a new study suggests antibodies often don't stick around for long after an infection.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Zuleika Chan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The study also found that despite having no outward symptoms, 70 per cent had lung abnormalities detectable in X-rays at some point during infection — mostly spots called "ground-glass opacities," which can indicate inflammation or other signs of disease.</p>  <h2>No antibodies could mean no immunity, but not necessarily</h2>  <p>Dr. Samir Gupta, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, noted in an interview with CBC News Network earlier this week that the study was very small.</p>  <p>Gupta, who wasn't involved in the study, added that it wasn't surprising that antibody levels fell a few months after infection. He said that's normal, since it's energy intensive for the body to maintain antibodies it doesn't need.</p>  <p>What was "a little bit surprising," he said, was the fact that 40 per cent of people with asymptomatic infections had no detectable antibodies at all.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Dr. Samir Gupta on Alberta's testing plans:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Dr. Samir Gupta says Alberta's testing may help to understand how far the coronavirus spread but he's doubtful we've reached herd immunity.<!-- --> <!-- -->8:35</span></span></span></p>  <p>However, Gupta&nbsp;said,&nbsp;people have immunity to coronaviruses that cause common colds for only a few months, and that may also be the case for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p>  <p>On the other hand, he said, "antibodies aren't the whole story."</p>  <p>There are other components of the immune system that play a role, such as memory cells. They remember a pathogen&nbsp;and begin releasing antibodies when they encounter it again, but they are hard to detect, Gupta said.</p>  <h2>What this means for herd immunity and vaccines</h2>  <p>Still, Tania Watts, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study, expressed concern about the implications.</p>  <p>"This suggests that natural infection may not give long-lasting immunity, which is what people have been worried about," she said.</p>  <p>Some countries <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2376"><u>such as Sweden</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/herd-immunity-should-not-be-supported-tam-says-1.5545332"><u>at least one Canadian province</u></a> have previously suggested that one way to control the spread of COVID-19 is to allow most of the population to get infected in a controlled fashion to generate <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/herd-immunity-should-not-be-supported-tam-says-1.5545332"><u>"herd immunity."</u></a>&nbsp;Once the population reaches a certain threshold of previous infection, there won't be enough susceptible people to spread the virus, and it can't spread exponentially as an epidemic.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5574385.1589816270!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-vaccine-race.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A patient receives a shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 in March. A vaccine will need to produce a strong and long-lasting immune response, something that natural infection may not always do.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But Watts said the low and short-lived levels of antibodies in asymptomatic infections in this study suggest we can't rely on herd immunity being induced for long enough a period of time to have an impact.</p>  <p>That means we may need to wait for a vaccine that induces a stronger, longer-lived response than many natural infections, she said.&nbsp;"I think this puts even more pressure on vaccine development."</p>  <h2>What this means for antibody tests,&nbsp;'immunity passports'</h2>  <p>Watts said another implication of the study is that serological (blood) or antibody tests — which have been touted as a way to get an idea of who has been previously infected, how much of the population that represents&nbsp;and how close that is to herd immunity —&nbsp;may not work as hoped.</p>  <p>And it throws cold water on the idea of controversial "<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/immunity-passes-could-be-an-interim-measure-on-the-way-to-reopening-society-physician-says-1.5544368"><u>immunity passports</u></a>," the idea of allowing more social interactions, such as work, travel&nbsp;and mass gatherings, for people who have previously been infected and therefore are immune and can't spread the virus — which would be based on serological testing.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Until we know what part of the immune system is protective," Watts said, "it's difficult to be able to do a test and tell someone you're safe or not."</p>  <h2>What this&nbsp;means for disease transmission</h2>  <p>While it's known that presymptomatic people can transmit COVID-19, it's not really known whether people who remain asymptomatic through the course of the disease can.</p>  <p>Watts said she thinks the finding in this study that people without symptoms shed the virus longer than people with&nbsp;symptoms is "shocking" and suggests we need to worry about transmission from asymptomatic people.</p>  <p>"Until we have a vaccine, I think we should have very clear recommendations that everybody wears masks."</p>    <p>She said the longer period of viral shedding is probably because a lack of symptoms indicate a weaker immune response, resulting in a longer time to clear the infection.</p>  <p>On the other hand, too intense an immune response is what puts patients in the ICU struggling to breathe.</p>  <p>The ideal is somewhere in between&nbsp;and what we'd like in a vaccine, Watts&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"We really need that Goldilocks immune response."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/81239044-afe24580-8fd1-11ea-96b0-274cf839e834.png" alt="the haskell type system: a machine of constant, unforgiving judgement and rigid classification"></p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>String</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

    <span>uint32_t</span> nbuckets;
    <span>uint32_t</span> symoffset;

    <span>uint64_t</span> bloom[bloom_size]; 
    <span>uint32_t</span> buckets[nbuckets];
    <span>uint32_t</span> chain[];
};
</pre><h2>Bloom filter</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a> is used to stop the lookup for missing symbols early. <code>bloom_size</code>, <code>bloom_shift</code>, and <code>bloom</code> are parts of the structure, as their names suggest.</p><p>Bloom filter behaves slightly differently for various <code>ELFCLASS</code> binaries (defined by <code>EI_CLASS</code> field in <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi4+/ch4.eheader.html#elfid">ELF Identification</a>). Let's define <code>ELFCLASS_BITS</code> to be <code>64</code> for 64-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS64</code>) and <code>32</code> for 32-bit binaries (<code>ELFCLASS32</code>).</p><p>Before doing symbol lookup, take <code>bloom[(hash / ELFCLASS_BITS) % bloom_size]</code>. If bits <code>hash % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> and <code>(hash &gt;&gt; bloom_shift) % ELFCLASS_BITS</code> are set then a symbol <strong>may or may not</strong> be in the hash table, and you should proceed with a regular lookup through buckets and chains. But if at least one bit is not set then a symbol is <strong>certainly</strong> absent from the hash table.</p><h2>Buckets and chains</h2><p><code>DT_HASH</code> contains an element per symbol table's element. This leads to a waste of space because <code>STN_UNDEF</code> and some other symbols are in the hash table but are never looked up. GNU hash table allows to skip first <code>symoffset</code> symbols at the beginning of the symbol table.</p><p>Same as in <code>DT_HASH</code>, symbols are put in one of <code>nbuckets</code> buckets depending on their hashes. To be specific, each symbol should be placed into <code>hash % nbuckets</code> bucket.</p><p>Chains in the GNU hash table are nothing like strange linked lists in <code>DT_HASH</code>, they are contiguous sequences of hashes for symbols with the same index (remember that chains' indexes are shifted by <code>symoffset</code> relatively to the symbol table). The last bit in chains' element is discarded and instead used for indicating the chain's end. If it is set then the element is the last one in the chain.</p><p><code>bucket</code> array holds indexes of the first symbols in the chains. Note that those are not indexes for the <code>chain</code> array. Indexes for it will be <code>bucket[foobar] - symoffset</code>.</p><p>Chains being contiguous sequences imply that symbols within the same bucket must be stored contiguously. Order of buckets in the symbol table does not really matter but usually they're stored in an ascending order.</p><p>While looking extraneous, creating such restriction over the symbol table gives great advantage: a hash table now can store almost full hash (without the lowest bit) of a symbol within the same 32 bits. This allows linkers to compare hashes before comparing strings. Also, because <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> requires symbol table ordering and <code>DT_HASH</code> doesn't, you can fit both into a single binary. This way both standard and GNU linkers can look up symbols in it.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Nothing is better than a visual representation of the rules. So, let's create one.</p><p>I took the same symbols as in <a href="https://flapenguin.me/2017/04/24/elf-lookup-dt-hash">ELF: symbol lookup via DT_HASH</a> and created <code>DT_GNU_HASH</code> table from them. The example is for 64-bit ELF binaries, for 32-bit you'll need to recalculate bloom word and bits.</p><pre>nbuckets = 4      (because I decided that there will be four buckets)
symoffset = 1    (STN_UNDEF is not a part of the hash table)
bloom_size = 2   (because I decided that 16 byte bloom filter is sufficient)
bloom_shift = 5  (again, just because I can)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Workers get set to pour cement from a truck at the GO train station in Oakville, Ont., Tuesday, Jan.28, 2020. A new report by the Angus Reid Institute suggests the majority of Canadians support the idea of a shorter work week. (Richard Buchan/THE CANADIAN PRESS)</p><div>
                    <p>Support for the idea of a shorter work week is growing in popularity in Canada as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to upend the working lives of Canadians, according to a <a href="http://angusreid.org/four-day-work-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study by the Angus Reid Institute</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of Canadians (53 per cent) surveyed by the non-profit research centre said it would be a good idea to make a new 30-hour work week standard in Canada, the study found.</p>
<p>That’s a six-point increase compared to 2018 and more than twice the number of people who feel the present 40-hour workweek is just fine, the survey said.</p>
<p>Researchers at the institute speculate that the increase in support for a shorter workweek is perhaps driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and difficulties it has presented for many out of work Canadians.</p>
<p>The proportion of supporters of a 30-hour workweek rises to 58 per cent among those who have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. This is eight-points higher than those who have not applied for the program, the study found.</p>
<p>Support for a shorter workweek is highest at the lowest levels of household income (64 per cent) and lowest among those with incomes over $150,000 per year (47 per cent).</p>
<p>Past Conservative voters are the most fervent in their opposition to the idea of a shorter workweek.</p>
<p>This group is most likely to say that shortening the work week is an ill-conceived idea, 40 per cent feel this way, while two-thirds of past Liberal and New Democratic Party voters voice support for the measure.</p>
<h5>‘An interesting notion’</h5>
<p>Ricardo Tranjan, senior researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said “30 for 40”, thirty hours work for forty hours pay, is an interesting notion, and one that should be widely discussed, even beyond the COVID-19 context.</p>
<p>Shorter working weeks would allow workers to participate more actively in their children’s education, spend more time caring for their own parents and engage in leisure and physical activities that would have a positive impact on their health, Tranjan said.</p>
<p>Ten additional hours at home could go a long way in alleviating “double shifts,” which burden women disproportionately more than men, he said.</p>
<p>“But I have two critical concerns,” Tranjan said. “First, this can’t happen unless wages are adequate. We would absolutely need to maintain the same wage levels for shorter weeks, but for some workers, that wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
<p>People who work 40 hours a week at the minimum wage are very likely to have household incomes close to the poverty line, he said.</p>
<p>“If we reduce hours for these workers, they’re likely to pick up extra shifts, hoping that will allow them to afford things like new winter jackets for the kids or more and healthier food for the family,” Tranjan said.</p>
<p>“Meantime, higher-wage workers will be enjoying all the benefits of shorter weeks, so we’ll be just exacerbating social inequalities.”</p>
<p>Tranjan said his second concern has to do with eligibility for income supports, which is often tied to working hours.</p>
<p>“For example, will employment insurance eligibility be reduced if weeks are reduced? Or will we end up with even fewer people qualifying for EI benefits?” Tranjan said. “We need to tackle these questions heads on, but we should continue to have this conversation.”</p>
<h5>Business owners not buying it</h5>
<p>Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), which has more than 100,000 members, said it should surprise no one that the majority of Canadians like the idea of a four-day work week.</p>
<p>“The only people who would say no to such an idea are those that immediately recognize that this would likely require a 20 per cent reduction in their weekly pay or the massive unemployment that would occur if businesses were required to pay the same for fewer working hours,” Kelly said. “I would like six months of vacation and double my salary – that doesn’t mean it would be a reasonable request.”</p>
<p>Half of small Canadian businesses remain fully or partially closed due to the pandemic and most of those open now will be losing money every week they are open for months and months ahead, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Businesses have been hit with multiple months of lost productivity, rising debt and the costs of the personal protective equipment they now have to procure, Kelly said.</p>
<p>“Shorter work weeks at the same rate of pay for their staff would be an impossibility for nearly every business at this time,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Twelve per cent of independent businesses report they are considering winding down or going bankrupt, he added.</p>
<p>“There could be 100,000 fewer small businesses before this is over,” Kelly said. “Let’s not push that number even higher.”</p>

				<p><em>Whatever else happens, you made a movie… Nobody can take that away. A hundred years from now, when we're all dead and gone, people will be watching this fucking thing.</em></p>
<p><em>– <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> to his nephew (whom he murders over this movie in a few episodes)</em></p>
<p>So I made a 90-second animated, um, I guess it's a blog post. I don't know about a hundred years from now, but I proudly invite you to watch the fucking thing right now:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xTOHyWphzFc" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I hear that it's considered classy for animators, filmmakers and such to let their work stand on its own, either refraining from commentary or making it vague. However, anxious to secure my spot in eternity, I decided to rush my immortal masterpiece out the door, so I cut everything I could.</p>
<p>I then realized that I left out a delicate point which, despite my embarrassment, I must mention. Luckily, typing is much easier than animating, so the following afterthought was quick to put down [1]. Here goes.</p>
<p>The short isn't exactly a documentary, but real-life me did switch to a part-time job to free some time for animating, drawing, etc. I figured this mundane little step was a good topic for a starting filmmaker because it turned out to be surprisingly controversial. Here are some of the reactions I received:</p>
<ul>
<li>"So you finally got fed up with the job?"</li>
<li>"Part-time? But everyone here <em>needs</em> you!"</li>
<li>"Wow, I'm jealous! I want to work less, too. They pay you the same, right?" No, they pay less, I said. "Oh. Ha-ha. Work less, get less. Interesting!"</li>
<li>"You should really work more, not less, while you're young. Futurists predict a huge global pension crisis, so save for your retirement!"</li>
<li>"I doubt this will fly with the big deadline coming. Who's gonna do all the work? Not me!" (This guy works part-time himself – very productively.)</li>
<li>"Doesn't your wife object?" (Actually, my light table is Rachel's gift. I don't know when/if I'd ever get one on my own.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments suggest that many people want to work less, but something is keeping them from doing it. I can certainly relate to that. It took me 10 years to decide to work part-time – and then <em>5 more years to actually do it</em>.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard?</p>
<p>My own reasons mostly revolve around money. Where I live, money is much easier to make programming than animating (good luck even finding a half-stable job working on animated features.)</p>
<p>Hence "I went into programming for the money", as I said in the short – as I always say. And initially I figured I'd work all I can and retire early – the opposite of working part-time and animating in my spare time ("settling for a fraction of the dream"). And you've just seen how I changed my mind.</p>
<p>But there's another thing, which I usually<em> don't </em>say and which I must reluctantly admit. You see, I came for the money, and then I started liking the <em>getting paid</em> part.</p>
<p>What's the difference between money and getting paid? There's a world of difference!</p>
<p>Winning a lottery is a way to obtain money without getting paid for a service. And spending your wage on designer clothes is a way to get paid without having any money left. The difference is this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money</strong> lets you buy things – food, living space, spare time, etc. It's about <strong>options</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Getting paid</strong> tells you the value of your service to whoever paid you. It's about <strong>achievement</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like getting paid, I must admit despite the embarrassment.</p>
<p>Note that I'm not ashamed in the slightest to like money (options) and to have chosen a profession with the sole purpose of maximizing income.</p>
<p>Some people believe that you can't be happy doing something you don't love – and that you can't be any good at it, hence you won't make that much money, either. I disagree.</p>
<p>I'll tell you who my role model is, as a computer programmer. It's neither Bill Gates nor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. My role model is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, whom you probably remember as Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars. Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In letters to his friends, Guinness described the film as "fairy tale rubbish" &lt;…&gt;</p>
<p>He was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be a box office hit;&nbsp; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the gross royalties &lt;…&gt;</p>
<p>Lucas and fellow cast members … have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, both on and off the set. Lucas &lt;said&gt; that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a man working on something he disliked because it paid – and delighting his target audience and colleagues alike. To me it shows that "extrinsic motivation" – money – is a perfectly good primary motivation, contrary to <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/07/09/extrinsic-motivations-are-harmful/">some researchers' conclusions</a>.</p>
<p>I'm in it for the money – hence, I'll never get bored and lose interest, as long as there's money to be made. I'll dutifully work on the unpleasant parts necessary to get things actually done (and get paid). Not liking programming that much, I try to keep my programs short and easy to maintain and extend – so I can program less.</p>
<p>These are all desirable traits – and not everyone genuinely loving programming has them. Think about it. Who's the better henchman – the psychopath murdering for the thrill, or the coldblooded killer who's in it for an early retirement? Same thing here.</p>
<p>I'm your perfect henchman. Pay me, give me some time alone with your computers, and when you come back, you'll find them doing your bidding. Of this I am not ashamed.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I noticed that I'm no longer the coldblooded henchman I used to be, that I started to enjoy the thrill of the kill for its own sake. And this I cannot admit without blushing.</p>
<p>That's what getting paid does to the weak-minded. It warped my value system. The phases of my transition – or should I say my moral decay – went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I program because they pay me.</li>
<li>Programming is good because they pay me.</li>
<li>Programming is good.</li>
<li>Programming is good! I think I'll go program right now. Or read about it. Or write something about it. All in my spare time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there you have it. <strong>"Achievement" has been redefined to mean "that thing you get paid for".</strong></p>
<p>This is how I ended up with a website dedicated largely to programming. Then a programming blog on the site and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Yossi_Kreinin.php">a similar blog elsewhere</a>. Then came the ultimate downfall: <a href="https://github.com/yosefk">open-source programs on GitHub</a>, written during evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>And I don't regret the writing. Keeping readers' attention on my very dry programming-related subjects is a worthy challenge for any starting storyteller.</p>
<p>But <em>programming for free? Me?</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/quotes">If you're good at something, never do it for free!</a> Oh, how the weak-minded have fallen.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom to begin rising. So it was with me. Realizing that I've just programmed for free for several weekends in a row made me think. Hard.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you," I said to myself. "All this money-chasing at least made some sense. But programming for free? Why not <em>draw</em> in your spare time instead? What's <em>wrong </em>with you?"</p>
<p>"Not so fast," said self. "For free or not, at least here you are doing something you're good at. You know you're good – you get paid for it! Would they pay you for drawing? Not so soon. Maybe never. Even if you're any good. <strong>In fact you'll never know if you're any good. </strong>Not if you're never paid. Nor if you're paid badly, which happens all the time in those arty parts of the world, even to the best. Why not stick to things you're <em>good</em> at – that you <em>know </em>you're good at?"</p>
<p>Could you believe this guy? Well, I wouldn't have any of that.</p>
<p>"You shameless, hypocritical, baiting-and-switching COWARD," I screamed at self at the top of my lungs. "You always said programming was for the money – to buy time, to buy that bloody creative freedom you kept chattering about! And now you say I should keep programming because I got good at it? But of course I got good – I've been doing it all this time! I could have gotten just as good at drawing – <strong>I still can</strong> – if I have the time!"</p>
<p>"And you say that now when I can afford some spare time," I went on, "I should regardless stick to what I'm good at, which by now is programming? Are you hinting that I won't ever draw very well? Is <em>that </em>why you suggested a career in programming in the first place – because you didn't believe I could draw? Was that chanting about needing money one big lie all along? Tell me, you lying bastard! I'm gonna -"</p>
<p>"OK, OK, chill, man, CHILL!" Self looked scared and unsettled. He clearly didn't see it coming. Now he was looking for some way to appease me. "You know," said self, "maybe you're right. Remember how you're always proud of taking a long-term view? Of how you care today about things 5, even 10 years ahead?"</p>
<p>I smiled smugly. Indeed I was proud of my long-term-centered, strategic thinking. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Colwell">Bob Colwell</a> – the legendary computer architect – once said that it's the architect's duty to think about the long term, because nobody else will. I <em>so</em> identified with that. (Colwell and I are both computer architects, you see – just, um, of different calibers.)</p>
<p>"Well," said self, "you <em>should</em> be proud. Too many lose sight of the future because of today's small but pressing worries!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah." I was losing my patience. "Thanks but no thanks for your brown-nosing. Listen, are you playing bait and switch on me again? What does this have to do with drawing?"</p>
<p>"But that's the point – it's the same thing," self exclaimed, "it's about long-term thinking! Sure, in the short term, maybe you're better at programming than drawing. But keep practicing and yes, of course you'll get good at drawing! Use your favorite superpower – your ability to imagine the future vividly, to practically live there – to overcome the temptation to stick to your comfort zone! Secure a better future today! Be the shrewd guy investing in a little unknown startup – yourself the would-be animator – to reap great benefits down the road! Be -"</p>
<p>"I get it. That's what I said though, isn't it? Let's practice – let's draw in the spare time."</p>
<p>"Sure. Sure! You're right," said self submissively. "I'm actually helping you, see? I'm telling you how to use your strengths to take the plunge!"</p>
<p>"Thaaaanks. You know what? We'll …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Server cost is usually not a concern for most funded startups, but for a boot strapped SaaS product like ours,&nbsp; it was important to have an AWS bill that is easy on the pocket and a little more proportional to the MRR.</p><p>‍</p><p>To that end when we started<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> superlemon.xyz</a> one of the first things I did was to find ways to consume the least amount of resources on the cloud. We currently serve a traffic of ~ 250 requests per second with our AWS setup.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Most applications require certain common cloud resources and these include</p><p>‍<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Compute instances</li><li>Database instances</li><li>Caching instances</li><li>CDN&nbsp;</li><li>A web server that acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><div><p>I will now go through each of these resources and talk about both the expensive way and the cheap way to implement them</p></div><p><strong>Compute instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>When it comes to compute instances, most people go with AWS EC2 instances. EC2 instances are the safest choice to make for running server applications as they are highly configurable, scalable and you can change the configuration on demand according to your needs. However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/" target="_blank">AWS Lightsail</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.</p><figure id="w-node-7afe1c2bdee3-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-2074947a61a8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>EC2 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.</p><p>An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!</p><p>‍<br></p><p>The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.</p><p><strong>Database instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.</p><figure id="w-node-e1f43dee380f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Database restoration from recent backup</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Caching instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is<a href="http://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> prometheus.io</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one</p><figure id="w-node-ed9ef23d383f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CDN</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.</p><figure id="w-node-78b80f124ebd-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shopify CDN&nbsp;that is free of cost</figcaption></figure><p>There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS&nbsp;file to begin with.</p><p><strong>Web server + load balancer</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Serving static files for our application dashboard</li><li>Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL</li><li>Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.</li><li>Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use<a href="http://amplify.nginx.com/" target="_blank"> amplify.nginx.com</a> for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-26b2c44e15ee-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)</li><li>Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)</li><li>Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$)&nbsp;</li><li>If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)</li><li>Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)</li></ul><p><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us.

      <p>SwiftUI feels very young when it first announced last year in WWDC19. It shows a promising future, but it has a rough edge here and there, and it quite hard to predict what it will be like in a year. The year has passed, and here is my thought on Apple's new declarative UI framework SwiftUI.</p>
<h2 id="the-gap-is-getting-closer">The gap is getting closer <a href="#the-gap-is-getting-closer">#</a></h2>
<p>My arguments around SwiftUI are always like, "You can't do x (UIKit features) in SwiftUI". This year, Apple show an incredible pace of SwiftUI development. The missing UI elements from last year already have a SwiftUI counterpart, e.g., <code>UIColelctionView</code> and <code>UITextField</code> already have a SwiftUI counterpart of <code>LazyH/VGrid</code> and <code>TextEditor</code>.</p>
<h2 id="first-class-citizen">First-class citizen <a href="#first-class-citizen">#</a></h2>
<p>It looks like SwiftUI doesn't want to be just a view for UIKit anymore. Now, you can write an entire app using pure SwiftUI.</p>
<p>The following is a working SwiftUI app code.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>import</span> <span>SwiftUI</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@main</span><br><span><span>struct</span> <span>SwiftUIApp</span><span>:</span> <span>App</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>Scene</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>WindowGroup</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello! SwiftUI"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And the code above not just works on iOS, but the same code can make an iPad and Mac app. You can write a multiplatform app entirely with SwiftUI. Seem like the concepts of SwiftUI are far more powerful than I first thought.</p>
<h2 id="exclusive-deal">Exclusive Deal <a href="#exclusive-deal">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WidgetKit</a>, a new framework in iOS 14 for writing a Widget can only write using SwiftUI. This means you can't run away from it, even you love UIKit, it seems like you have no choice, but to also learn SwiftUI.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/29ba6373e9bf92bbbc301e0f6fb491f3cf51920a/819cd/images/swiftui-2-widget.png" alt="Widget">
  <figcaption>Widget</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="is-uikit-going-to-die%3F">Is UIKit going to die? <a href="#is-uikit-going-to-die%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Nope, it is far from over. I don't think Apple has a plan to drop UIKit in the foreseeable future. As working on UIKit for years, SwiftUI feels like magic to me. It can replicate UIKit function with a single line of code (or no line of code since it builds right into SwiftUI). The bad thing about magic is that when things are not going as you want, it is hard to figure out what's wrong, and it might not be possible to fix it. That's when you need to go back to UIKit. UIKit is a foundation of iOS, and Apple still keeps adding new features to it (UICollectionView and UISplitViewController got a lot of cool features this year, you should check it out).</p>
<p>I see UIKit as a secret sauce behind all SwiftUI magic. Both UIKit and SwiftUI have their strength, and Apple picks the right tool for the right job (they use SwiftUI for WidgetKit because it suits the constraint that Widget has right now). I think these two will coexist for a very long time.</p>
<p>Apple put years of experience in their UIKit and tools into SwiftUI. It is enjoyable to work with, and the outcome is phenomenal. Apple can do this because they set up a way to bridge SwiftUI to UIKit, so they know that even when SwiftUI fails to do some tasks, there will always have UIKit there.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Here comes the important question. Should you learn UIKit or SwiftUI?</p>
<p>My short answer would be <strong>SwiftUI</strong>.</p>
<p>And here is my long answer. From all the facts I point out in this article, SwiftUI is ready now. I think in the end you would end up learning both of them.</p>
<p>If you know UIKit, you are forced to learn SwiftUI since it is exclusive to a new framework like WidgetKit. Even not for that reason, I think you probably the one who appreciates SwiftUI the most. SwiftUI can do many great things right out of the box, things that we always want to do in UIKit, but don't have the opportunity and time to do it.</p>
<p>If you know SwiftUI, there would be a time that you want extra customization or hit some roadblock. When the time comes, UIKit will always there for you.</p>

        <p>Almost two months ago, I started building a four node Raspberry Pi 4 cluster for a project I’m working on. Figuring out the best way to get Linux on each node lead me down a rabbit hole and I spent the next four weeks <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html">yak shaving</a>.</p>
<p>The most common way to boot a Pi is from an SD card. But they are slow and unreliable - I don’t like them. Certain models of Pi 2 and Pi 3 support <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md">booting from USB storage</a>, but Pi 4 cannot do that yet. So, I’m stuck with using an SD card for each Pi. Or so I thought.</p>
<h3 id="enter-pxe-boot">Enter PXE boot</h3>
<p>Turns out, Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net.md">support network booting</a>. A beta firmware was released late last year that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> for Pi 4. I found <a href="https://linuxhit.com/raspberry-pi-pxe-boot-netbooting-a-pi-4-without-an-sd-card">an article on LinuxHit</a> detailing the process of installing the firmware and setting up network boot.</p>
<p>Just to test this out, I updated the firmware and configured PXE server on one of the Pis. I tried booting another Pi over the network and…it worked!
Here is the gist of PXE server setup process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contents of <code>/boot</code> and the rest of <code>/</code> into separate folders on your local filesystem. I copied mine to <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Install and configure <code>dnsmasq</code> to enable TFTP and use <code>/tftp</code> as <code>tftp-root</code></li>
<li>Install and configure NFS server to share <code>/tftp/raspbian-boot</code> and <code>/nfs/raspbian-root</code></li>
<li>Edit the contents of <code>/nfs/raspbian-root/fstab</code> to mount the boot partition.</li>
<li>Edit <code>/nfs/raspbian-boot/cmdline.txt</code> to</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/raspbian-root,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><h3 id="pxe-booting-3-nodes-using-overlayfs">PXE booting 3 nodes using OverlayFS</h3>
<p>I cannot just boot all three nodes from the same boot and root filesystems since they are not read-only. And I don’t want to maintain a copy of these for each node. But this is a solved problem - Docker already lets you spin up multiple containers from a single base image. So I’ll just do <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#how-the-overlay2-driver-works">what Docker does</a> - create <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html">OverlayFS</a> for each node using raspbian-root and raspbian-boot as my lower directories. I’ll share them over NFS like before.</p>
<p>Configuration for one of the nodes is below. Other two nodes follow the same pattern. Note that I moved raspbian-root and raspbian-boot to a USB hard drive (mounted at <code>/mnt</code>) to get better r/w performance. dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX is the MAC address of the node. I’m using <code>tftp-unique-root=mac</code> option in <code>dnsmasq</code> to maintain a separate boot environment for each node based on its MAC address.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>(In case you are wondering what <code>nog</code> is: I name my servers after planets from the Star Wars universe. Following this tradition, I’ve named the Pis Mandalore (PXE server), Nog, Ordo and Werda)</p>
<p>You are probably thinking that this worked. It did not.</p>
<p>NFS and OverlayFS did not play nice with each other. After a weekend trying to work around some weird issues, I gave up.</p>
<p>But OverlayFS is not the only copy-on-write filesystem in existence, is it? ZFS and BTRFS offer <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume">subvolumes and snapshots</a> that I can use instead. But not before I <del>procrastinate</del> spend 2 weeks deciding which one to use.</p>
<h3 id="moving-to-btrfs">Moving to BTRFS</h3>
<p>The plan is simple: I’ll create a subvolume each for raspbian-root and raspbian-boot. I’ll then create three snapshots of each subvolume - one for every node. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">btrfs file system</a> on my external drive and ran the following commands</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-root
$ btrfs subvolume create raspbian-boot

<span># Repeat the following for each node changing folder names as necessary</span>
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-boot nog-boot
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot raspbian-root nog-root
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-boot /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX
$ mount --bind /mnt/nog-root /nfs/nog

<span># Don’t forget to edit cmdline.txt for each node</span>
$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt
console<span>=</span>serial0,115200 console<span>=</span>tty1 root<span>=</span>/dev/nfs nfsroot<span>=</span>&lt;IP addr&gt;:/nfs/nog,vers<span>=</span>4.1,proto<span>=</span>tcp rw ip<span>=</span>dhcp rootwait elevator<span>=</span>deadline
</code></pre></div><p>Well, this worked! I have a Pi running without an SD card!! Now all I have to do is create systemd unit files to start all required services and mount snapshots. I can finally start working on my project.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Take a closer look at the output of <code>cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.
If you are like me, you will realize for the first time that <code>root=</code> in this file defines where the root filesystem will be mounted from. Right now, we are telling it to mount from <code>/dev/nfs</code>. What if I attach an external drive and set <code>root=</code> to point to the external drive?</p>
<h3 id="network-booting-into-a-usb-hard-drive">Network booting into a USB hard drive</h3>
<p>RPi 4 cannot directly boot from a USB drive. As in - it cannot find <code>/boot</code> on a USB drive when powering on. But what if we provide <code>/boot</code> with network boot and mount <code>/</code> from a USB drive using <code>cmdline.txt</code>? Time to test.</p>
<p>I copied raspbian-root to a USB drive, edited <code>fstab</code> to mount <code>/</code> using the partition’s PARTUUID and connected it to Nog. I then updated the contents of <code>/tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /tftpboot/dc-a6-32-XX-XX-XX/cmdline.txt

</code></pre></div><p>After a couple of reboots, it worked! I now have a RPi 4 running off a USB hard drive!</p>
<h3 id="what-did-i-gain">What did I gain?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with what I was looking for. All I wanted was to not deal with SD cards because they are slow and unreliable. Reliability is relative - everything fails at some point. But a decent quality USB hard drive will likely outlive an SD card. So let’s just look at some read/write performance numbers and see how they compare.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sync; dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero of<span>=</span>twogeefile bs<span>=</span>1M count<span>=</span>2048; sync  <span># Write performance</span>

<p>With network boot, I was able to get read and write speeds similar to a class 10 SD card. Note that the boot images are hosted on a USB hard drive connected to Mandalore (PXE server). NFS seems to be the bottleneck here - raw r/w speeds of the hard drive are much better than this. All Pis are connected to Netgear’s 8 port gigabit ethernet switch.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, things improve considerably when Pis are running off a USB hard disk. Note that the external drives I used are 5400RPM hard disks repurposed from very old MacBooks. I bought them on eBay for $10 a pop. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="current-setup">Current setup</h3>
<p>Right now, I have Mandalore booting from an SD card and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk. Nog, Ordo and Werda fetch <code>/boot</code> from Mandalore over the network and <code>/</code> mounted from a USB hard disk.</p>

   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>This specification uses pluggable protocols, with QUIC <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-quic-transport">[QUIC-TRANSPORT]</a> as
one such protocol, to send data to and receive data from servers. It can be
used like WebSockets but with support for multiple streams, unidirectional
streams, out-of-order delivery, and reliable as well as unreliable transport.</p>
   <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> The API presented in this specification represents a preliminary proposal
based on work-in-progress within the IETF QUIC WG. Since the QUIC transport
specification is a work-in-progress, both the protocol and API are likely to
change significantly going forward.</p>

   <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,

Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
   <p>The key words <em>MUST</em> and <em>SHOULD</em> are to be interpreted as described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
   <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product:
the user agent that implements the interfaces that it contains.</p>
   <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
   <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this

 many datagrams are queued because the stream is not being read quickly
 enough, drop datagrams to avoid queueing. Implementations should drop older
 datagrams in favor of newer datagrams. The number of datagrams to queue
 should be kept small enough to avoid adding significant latency to packet
 delivery when the stream is being read slowly (due to the reader being slow)
 but large enough to avoid dropping packets when for the stream is not read
 for short periods of time (due to the reader being paused).</p>
