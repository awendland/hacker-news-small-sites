			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

These are not the type of ideas that will bring in huge sums of money. No. These are little things you can do every day to earn or save some money to survive a recession, unemployment or any other temporary financial setback.</p><p>If you have a stable job and earn about £100k a year, this list probably isn't for you. This list is for people who've been made redundant and need money to help them get by until they find a new job. It's for a mother who just had a baby, isn't working, and has a couple of hours to spare each day. It's for that person who is curious and wants to know how to make £5 today or £50 tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>If this all makes sense, here are my top twelve ideas for making money online to survive a recession in 2020. Note that the examples I used here are specific to the UK, but the general ideas are applicable globally.<br></p><h2><strong>1. Online Surveys</strong></h2><blockquote>Get paid to participate in research from universities and companies.</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://prolific.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Prolific</strong></a> - The pay is roughly about minimum wage. The more surveys you do, the more you'll earn. There's a Chrome extension that alerts you whenever a new survey is available. You'll need at least a fiver to cash-out, which is roughly three to six surveys.</li><li><a href="https://www.qmee.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Qmee</strong></a> - Earn cash rewards for engaging with brands and for sharing your opinion by answering surveys. There's no minimum payout, and the money goes straight to PayPal.</li><li><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>YouGov</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Complete surveys to earn points. You can redeem your points for £50 cash.</li><li><a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/" target="_blank"><strong>Google rewards</strong></a> - Complete short surveys and get rewarded with Google Play or PayPal credits. The payout is quite small, so most people use it to pay for things like magazine subscriptions and mobile games.</li><li><a href="https://www.populuslive.com/" target="_blank"><strong>PopulusLive:</strong></a> Earn money for completing surveys. The minimum payout is £50. Payments are made by bank transfer (BACS) or by cheque.</li></ol><h2><strong>2. Cashback</strong></h2><blockquote>‍<strong>‍</strong>Cashback is a service that lets you get money back on goods, services, and travel through exclusive partnerships with brands and leading retailers. For example, if you spent £50 at Tesco and got a 10% cashback, that's free £5 in your pocket. Here's how to get cashback:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Banks </strong>- Some of the big banks offer cashback to their customers. Check your mobile app or online banking to see if your bank offers cashback. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk/current-accounts/cashback/" target="_blank">Barclays</a> (up to 10% cashback), <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/online-banking/benefits-online-banking/everyday-offers.html" target="_blank">Lloyds</a> (up to 15% cashback) and <a href="https://www.santander.co.uk/personal/support/understanding-our-services/retailer-offers" target="_blank">Santander</a> (up to 15% cashback).</li><li><strong>Cashback Sites </strong>- These are independent companies that give you money back when you buy from one of their registered retailers or brands. The popular ones are <a href="https://www.quidco.com/" target="_blank">Quidco</a>, <a href="https://www.shopmium.com/uk" target="_blank">Shopmium</a>, <a href="https://ohmydosh.co.uk/" target="_blank">OhMyDosh</a>, <a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/" target="_blank">Swagbucks</a>, and <a href="https://www.topcashback.co.uk/" target="_blank">TopCashback</a>.</li></ol><h2><strong>3. Earn Rewards for your Data </strong></h2><blockquote>With these services, you share some of your data like a scanned copy of your supermarket receipt to earn rewards. Here are some companies that offer these services:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.airtimerewards.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Airtime Rewards</strong></a> - This is great for people looking to reduce or offset their mobile phone bills. You need to link your card first, then each time you make a purchase at a registered retailer, you'll earn a reward. You can redeem this reward to your mobile bill.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.shoppixapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Shoppix</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Snap receipts and answer surveys to collect tokens. You can redeem tokens for cash via a PayPal account or vouchers of £5, £10 and £20.</li><li><a href="https://www.huyuapp.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Huyu</strong></a> - Here, you scan supermarket receipts and answer surveys for rewards like shopping vouchers. The minimum payout is 500 points.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>4. Referral Deals</strong></h2><blockquote>Most tech companies will offer you money when you invite your friends to join their website or sign up for their app. Even <a href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/1f4afe751/?" target="_blank">Koody</a> has a referral deal. Here are a few good ones:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/LAMB" target="_blank"><strong>Look After My Bills</strong></a><strong> </strong>- You and your friend each get a £20 voucher if your friend switches both gas and electricity through your referral link. You both get a £10 voucher if your friend switches electricity only.</li><li><a href="http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/display/1f4afe751/?" target="_blank"><strong>Koody</strong></a> - Invite a friend to join our personal finance community, and you both stand a chance of winning £10.</li><li><a href="https://withplum.com/referral/" target="_blank"><strong>Plum</strong></a> - Earn £15 for each three successful referrals.</li><li><a href="https://bulb.co.uk/referral/" target="_blank"><strong>Bulb</strong></a> - You and your friend each get £50 when your friend switches their electricity and gas over to Bulb, or £25 if they just switch electricity or gas.</li><li><a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/news/metro-bank-new-refer-a-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a> - Refer your friend, and you both receive £50 after a successful switch. The offer runs until 11th December 2020.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>5. Product Reviewer Jobs</strong></h2><blockquote>‍<strong>‍</strong>You can earn some extra cash by reviewing products online and testing websites. For these types of jobs, expect to get paid between £8 and £20 for a task which might take you 20 to 25 minutes to complete. Most payments are via PayPal. Below are five websites for product reviews and testing:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.testingtime.com/en/become-a-paid-testuser/" target="_blank"><strong>TestingTime</strong></a> - You can earn up to €50 per hour.</li><li><a href="https://www.hellopingpong.com/become-a-tester" target="_blank"><strong>Pingpong</strong></a> - Earn between €15 and €100 for each session. Payments are via Paypal or Transferwise.</li><li><a href="https://www.usercrowd.com/" target="_blank"><strong>UsabilityHub/UserCrowd</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Minimum payout is $10.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.intellizoom.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Intellizoom</strong></a> - Most studies take an average of 10-20 minutes. You can expect to make $2 - $10 per study on average.</li><li><a href="https://userbrain.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Userbrain</strong></a> - Receive new tests each week and get paid $3 per test.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2><strong>6. Energy Auto-switching</strong><br></h2><blockquote>This one saves you time and money. Auto-switching companies automatically switch your energy tariff to keep you on the best deal. It takes about two minutes to sign up, and it's completely free except you opt-in for a paid plan. Here are the ones we feature on Koody:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/switchd" target="_blank"><strong>Switchd</strong></a> - Depending on the size of your home, you could save £400+ a year.</li><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/LAMB" target="_blank"><strong>Look After My Bills</strong></a> - 99% of new members on credit meters find a saving straight away.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>7. Smart Savings</strong><br></h2><blockquote>You will hardly make any new money from this idea. Instead, you'll save some of what you already have. Here's how to save smartly:</blockquote><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Round Ups</strong> - Some apps like <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Moneybox</a> help you save your spare change by rounding up your card transactions to the nearest pound and saving the difference (e.g., if you spend £2.30 on a snack, these apps save 70p for you). Over an extended period, this money adds up and could become quite valuable. Some banks also offer round ups. Check to see if your bank does.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Auto-saving</strong> - Automating your savings saves you time and reduces the temptation of spending above your budget. There are two ways you can automate your savings:<strong>‍</strong></li></ol><ul role="list"><li>~~Do it yourself<strong> </strong>- Set up a standing order to move money from your current account to your savings account every month. This is easy, and you can do it with your bank's mobile app or online banking.<strong>‍</strong></li><li>~~Use an auto-savings app - Some apps will automate your savings by moving money from your current account to an e-wallet regularly. These apps are useful if you want to reduce the temptation of dipping into your savings. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://withplum.com/" target="_blank">Plum</a>, <a href="https://www.getchip.uk/" target="_blank">Chip</a>, <a href="https://www.tandem.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/" target="_blank">Cleo</a>. You can read more about auto-saving apps <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/auto-saving" target="_blank">here</a>.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>8. Bank Switching Deals</strong></h2><blockquote>Many big banks will offer you money to move your current account over to them. I'm not a massive fan of bank switching deals because it can take several months to receive the bonus. But, if you're a patient person, you should check out the ones below:</blockquote><p><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://personal.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/select_account.html" target="_blank"><strong>Natwest Everyday Bank Account</strong></a> - £125 switching bonus (available to new and existing customers).</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 15th January 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 15th January 2021.</li><li>Receive the £125 bonus by 12th February 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong>‍<a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/products/advance/" target="_blank"><strong> HSBC Advance</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £125 bonus when you switch to HSBC + access to 2.75% Regular savings account.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Open the account as a new customer.</li><li>Use the Current Account Switch Service within 30 days to complete a full switch with at least two direct debits or standing orders.</li><li>The bonus will be paid within 30 days of the switch completing.</li><li>You will need to pay in £1,750 or more each month (you can always close the account once you've received the bonus).</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>3.</strong><a href="https://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal/current_accounts.html" target="_blank"><strong> RBS</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 bonus when you switch to RBS</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive your £100 bonus by 29th January 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/switch.html" target="_blank"><strong>Lloyds Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 when you switch to Lloyds bank.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive the £100 bonus ten working days after switching.</li><li>Offer runs until 9th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/news/metro-bank-new-refer-a-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- If you are an existing Metro bank customer, you can refer a friend, and you'll both receive £50 after your friend successfully switches to Metro. The offer runs until 11th December 2020.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>9. Sell Old Stuff Online</strong></h2><blockquote>Selling your old stuff online is one of the best ways to make money quickly. It is also pretty straightforward and effortless to implement. You can sell anything from used clothes to old gadgets. You also can list your products as 'collection only' so you don't have to bother about delivery and delivery costs. However, if you want to appeal to a broader audience, remember to factor in delivery costs. Here are a few places where you can sell things online:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li>Facebook Marketplace</li><li>Instagram</li><li>eBay</li><li>Etsy</li><li>Amazon</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>10. Hobbies</strong></h2><blockquote>Identify your hobby and find a way to make money from it. Here are a few popular hobbies and my suggestions on how to make money from them:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Drawing/Painting </strong>- sell your art online.</li><li><strong>Handyman </strong>- list your services online.</li><li><strong>Gardening</strong> - sell the house plants online.</li><li><strong>Photography</strong> - sell your photos using image hosting services like <a href="https://www.smugmug.com/" target="_blank">SmugMug</a>.</li><li><strong>Writing</strong> - start a blog.</li><li><strong>Cooking</strong> - start a youtube channel or an Instagram or TikTok account.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2><strong>11. Employee Discounts</strong><br></h2><p>People often forget to take advantage of employee perks. Websites like <a href="https://www.perksatwork.com/" target="_blank">Perks At Work</a> and <a href="https://www.perkbox.com/uk" target="_blank">Perkbox</a> offer discounts on several retailers and brands. Employee perks are company-specific, so if you and your partner don't work in a company that offers them, you won't be able to benefit from them.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Combining employee perks with cashback offers can be quite powerful and can significantly reduce your bills. It is also worth adding that even if it's just your partner who has access to these discounts, you can also benefit from them.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>12. Improve your Skills</strong></h2><p>If you've been made redundant, there's never been a better time to start improving your skills.</p><p>As you take advantage of some of the money-making ideas I listed above, try to dedicate some time each …</p></div></div></div></div>

       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses: hide your phone out of sight, reach, and hearing.</strong><br>
       Put your phone where you can't see, reach it, or hear it. A drawer or a backpack both work.</li>
       <li><strong>Block distracting sites on your computer.</strong><br>
       You can use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/home">our extension</a>&nbsp;or some other extension that performs the same function - blocking distracting sites in your browser. When you don't have the option of opening a new YouTube tab and going down a rabbit hole, you can focus better.</li>

       </ul>
       </li>

       </ul>
       
       <h4>How to concentrate better</h4>
       <p>Now that we have less to ignore, how to really hone in on work?</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Go…</strong></p></li></ul></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tags: programming, elixir, supervisor, supervision tree</p></div><p data-v-d417aca0="">As developers, we always strive to offer our clients a high-quality service (or at least we should :) ). One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">As you can see, it's quite simple. We have <code data-v-d417aca0="">start/0</code> function, which we'll call to start our tree.

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">There is a bit more going on here. First, let's discuss <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> function.

That function has to return <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, where <code data-v-d417aca0="">pid</code> will be used by the supervisor to track the process. In <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/0</code>, we just log to the console that we're starting the process and use Elixir's <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task</code> module to start a simple process. <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task.start_link/1</code> returns <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, which is just what we need.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">We set the process to sleep for 1 000 000 milliseconds so that we have the time to play around with them, shutting them down and watching them restart. In real world applications, you would probably use <code data-v-d417aca0="">GenServer</code> or something similar here, i.e. some useful logic, but that's not the point of this post.

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> Creative problem solving requires (1) vast expert knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability" title="Stability">stability</a>, and (2) rich new knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a>. Vast stable knowledge makes it easy to solve algorithmic problems. Those problems can be solved at low energy expenditure with the help of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fast_thinking" title="Fast thinking">fast thinking</a>. Problems that require "thinking out of the box" rely on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>, i.e. association of remote ideas. Creativity and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> are powered by "hungry knowledge", i.e. fresh knowledge that can easily be molded and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalized</a> via <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting" title="Forgetting">forgetting</a>. This plasticity provides for good pattern matching in new learning and in creative problem solving</i></blockquote>

To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-nothing | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-nothing">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What do I want the future to be like? What amazing inventions do I want to see, and help build in my lifetime? I realized this morning that I don’t know. I was shocked.</p> <p>I’ve been tinkering with technology since I was a child, and I’ve been investing in early-stage companies for the past five years. More than sixty bets on the future. I’m meant to have bold visions of a better world, theses I support, and capital that I allocate in a technologically optimistic way. I began investing in startups because I wanted to help shape the future. And while I still get excited talking to founders with bold ideas, I have none of my own.</p> <p>When I was a teen, growing up on a diet of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and Alvin Toffler’s Futurism, I had plenty of big ideas: spaceflight, supersonic travel, mag-lev trains, geodesic domes, bio-nanotech for longevity, and social organization to provide maximum freedom for all. Cheesy, but optimistic.</p> <p>Now I am 29 and I have no big, optimistic ideas. I think of plenty of arbitrages and improvements in efficiency. And while I believe that better infrastructure enables more construction and innovation, closing an obscure pricing gap just isn’t like dreams of great adventure and exploration on the frontier of human experience and possibility.</p> <p>I spend much time thinking about solutions to existing problems – the incentive mismatch in mass media that is causing accelerating polarization, how to remedy the effects of climate change, and so on. But these are all <em>fixes</em>, reactions. It feels like I’m in the belly of the ship, frenetically plugging leaky holes, never even having the space of mind to think <em>where the ship should go</em>. Ostensibly, those decisions are made on the bridge of the ship, which, in October 2020, seems to be populated by well-intentioned individuals, but hamstrung in their ability to make good collective decisions.</p> <p>Recent years have shown me how difficult it is to make <em>any</em> meaningful public decision. Every debate is endlessly contentious, every subject has meaningful nuance, and every decision has exceedingly hard-to-predict second-order-effects. The world is much more complex than it was even twenty years ago, and the effects are paralyzing. This is clearly felt among policymakers, but I feel it even as a technologist: I understand that virtually all tools can be used – and more often than not, <em>will</em> be used – for both good and evil, and how hard the results are to predict over years in our dynamic world. I learned that technology can rarely solve fundamental social problems, and I’ve seen the public perception rollercoaster of “this technology/person/policy is good” to “this is evil” more times than I can count.</p> <p>This puts me in a real bind for having high-conviction views that aren’t microscopically focused. As an example, for the past few years I have struggled developing a long-term view on bitcoin. By network effect, I think it is clear that in the long term, we will have <em>either</em> fiat or crypto – either fully centralized or fully decentralized – not both. Which world do I want to live in? I’m not sure. On the one hand, it is clear that our existing US financial system is fragile with systemic risk, a playball exposed to potentially irresponsible governance. You might call its mechanics unfair to the masses, but you’d also need to point out that it has <em>actually worked</em> in creating prosperity over the past 110 years. (And, comparing the US to other countries, it has worked remarkably well!) I agree with need for overhaul of the system, but I’m not sure if it’s wise throw out the entire thing and open up the world’s largest power vacuum in the process. This rarely ends well. I cannot tell, with intellectual honesty, which avenue is best to pursue. I doubt that anyone does.</p> <p>Other arenas of big problems and changes yield similar dilemmas. Perhaps consequently, I have found myself not dreaming big anymore. I dream small, where the effects are predictable. On dreaming big, there is the paralysis of responsibility and effects, but there is also a level of cynicism that has come to me over the years, as big dreams turn out to be much more fraught and complicated as they move into reality. The nuance, complexity, difficulty, responsibility, and often <em>irreversibility</em> in effecting big changes has slowly removed the stars from my eyes as I look at technology. Maybe that’s a good thing as I come to appreciate the gravity of change.</p> <p>But at the same time, if we don’t take big, bold, bets, we’ll be forever stuck in the valleys of local optima. As Bezos says, the size of your risk-taking should increase with the size of your enterprise – at scale, we should be taking many daring gambles, all the time. But it doesn’t feel like that’s really happening. It feels like we spend lots of effort debating marginal nuance, sitting in the belly of the ship doing maintenance, rather than charting the course forward.</p> <p>It is difficult to be an optimist in 2020. I admire the few<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup> that still have the courage to dream big and to remind ourselves that there <em>is</em> a future that could be amazing and that is worth fighting for.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A simpler approach to bookmarks]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all use the web, and we all use bookmarks. But did you know that you don’t have to use the bookmarking functionality built into your web browser?</p>
<p>This is why a while ago I migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jarun/buku">buku</a> and, at the time still pretty much living inside my web browser, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/samhh/bukubrow-webext">Bukubrow</a>. (I’m really creative at naming things as you can see!)</p>
<p>Any external bookmark manager is a ton better than using that which is built into your browser for one key reason - you’re no longer tied to a specific browser. Sure, you might (?) be able to import and export those bookmarks around, but it’s a hassle and not something I’d want to rely upon as browser vendors struggle to find reasons to differentiate, leaving platform lock-in increasingly tempting. I’m certain at one point it wasn’t possible at all, but I assume and hope that in the many years since things have improved.</p>
<p>You want to know something really annoying about buku? It’s written in Python. This means that, as the interpreter starts up on each <code>buku</code> invocation on the command-line, there’s a perceptible delay that isn’t present on any piece of software written in C, Rust, Go, Haskell, et cetera. (The same problem plagues JavaScript to an even worse extent.) It’s a terrible user experience. When you’re used to your terminal opening in mere milliseconds, this delay is extremely annoying. (Side note: If you’re running something like <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> and your prompt isn’t ready virtually immediately then you’re probably using something like Oh My Zsh!, which butchers the startup time of the prompt.)</p>
<p>Something else annoying about Python is the state of its package management. People rag on JavaScript projects’ complex and slow build systems, but at least once it’s distributed the end user typically has a single bundled script to run, just as with the other languages I’ve mentioned you’d generally have a single binary. Seemingly not so with Python! Installation of buku is painful because it carries with it a bunch of dependencies I don’t care about. These are implementation details for the author, and they probably shouldn’t be updated independently on my system. Can you imagine if all software was like this? You’d barely be able to go five minutes on Arch without some sort of dependency (of a dependency of a dependency) update requiring an update. <a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">beets</a>, also written in Python, as much as I love it, suffers these same issues.</p>
<p>This led me to wonder what alternatives are out there. After being broadly unsatisfied with what I found, and having spent a while really enjoying <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, I decided to roll my own solution. What started out as a vague idea to write a “simple” bookmark manager in Haskell a la pass resulted in a truly simple shell script. Introducing <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/bcb15d05274478d78b4eecb7f56dd813f15a9dbe/home/scripts/flatmarks.sh">flatmarks</a>, a script so simple it doesn’t even warrant its own project page.</p>
<p>This script depends upon only a single tool, <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a>, something a lot of folks running Linux with tiling window managers will already be using. It could be trivially updated to use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> or something else that can handle the interactive aspect. All it does is recursively collect the name of every file in a specified directory, present them to the user, and open the first line of the selected file in the browser. (Okay, technically it could open other stuff too as it’s calling <code>xdg-open</code>, but I’m not sure what else you’d put here. Maybe links to <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a>?)</p>
<p>The bookmarks directory itself can be thought of in the same way as pass’ password repo, except it’s lacking encryption. I suppose that could be quite easily implemented as well if you felt that necessary.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? I have a directory <code>~/.bookmarks/</code>, managed by git and backed up to a private remote somewhere, within which I have all my bookmarks. Most of them live at the root, but some are organised inside subdirectories. If ever I delete something and want it back, it’s right there in my git history. I don’t need to do anything at all if I change web browser. When I want to open a bookmark, regardless of where I am, I open <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/0f25b2e7cf4ca26482221347afac0034fee9f921/home/xmonad-samhh/Main.hs#L273">the keybind defined in my window manager</a>, which’ll open it up in my web browser of choice, currently <a href="https://github.com/fanglingsu/vimb">vimb</a>. When I want to add a bookmark I simply pop it into the repo and, if I want to keep it around for more than just a brief period of time, I commit it.</p>
<p>It’s a little more upfront work but the end result, in my eyes, is a lot simpler. It’s more ergonomic and it’s far less hostile to customisation and change. That seems to be the tradeoff with a lot of technology, Linux on the desktop as another example. The same can be said for a lot of the other software I’ve mentioned in this post too. But it’s totally worth it.</p>
<p>For anyone still using Bukubrow, this is why there hasn’t been much activity. It’s not abandoned, but I also don’t have much impetus to work on it as I did before as I no longer use it myself. You, too, might find a bash script and a git repo to be superior to anything more proprietary anyway.</p></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html?hn=20201024 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html?hn=20201024">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>Update (2020-03-29)</p>
<p>When I originally wrote this blog post, my intent was to describe how things
worked on a typical system at the time.
Unfortunately, the operation of bash startup scripts is dependent on
patches added by OS distributions, compile-time options and if bash thinks
it was invoked by sshd or rshd.
I have no desire to add complexity to this post, so instead please
read this as a rough approximation of the truth.
If you want to know for certain how it works on your system, the only answer
is <em>test it yourself</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you’re a regular shell user, you’ve almost certainly got a
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or <tt>.bashrc</tt> script in your home folder,
which usually contains various tweaks, such as setting environment variables
(adding that directory to <tt>$PATH</tt>), telling your shell to do clever things
(like <tt>set <span>-o</span> noclobber</tt>) and adding various aliases to commands
(like <tt>alias please=sudo</tt>).</p>
<p>(If you’re really organised, you’ll have all your dotfiles in a repository
somewhere so that you can keep your settings synchronised across all the
machines you work on.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I suspect that few people know when things like <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and
<tt>.bashrc</tt> actually get executed. When I started, I just followed people’s
advice of putting stuff in <tt>.bashrc</tt>, and then when it didn’t work, into
<tt>.bash_profile</tt>.
I could stop here and describe just the bash startup process (as silly as it
is), but there’s a complication in that I switched to zsh a few years ago
(and haven’t looked back), but occasionally use bash on machines which don’t
have zsh installed.</p>
<p>In order to handle this nicely then, I need to be able to specify things which
are specific to bash or zsh in their own files, and then to specify things
which any POSIX-compliant shell (like aliases and environment variables) can
understand in a common startup file.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to define some new dotfile folders,
one for each shell (<tt>.bash/</tt>, <tt>.zsh/</tt> and <tt>.sh/</tt>), and one for the
shell-independent files (<tt>.shell/</tt>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>.bash/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.sh/
    env
    interactive
    login
.shell/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.zsh/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
</pre></div>
<p>“But!”, you say, <a href="#since" id="id1">[1]</a> “what do the different files in here do?”
Ah, well I’m glad you asked.
There are two kinds of shells:</p>
<ul>
<li>[non-]interactive shells (you type into them / shell scripts)</li>
<li>[non-]login shells (the shell run when you first login / subshells)</li>
</ul>
<p>All shells will first run <tt>env</tt>, then login shells will run <tt>login</tt>,
then interactive shells will run <tt>interactive</tt>.
Once finished, login shells will run <tt>logout</tt>.</p>
<div id="where-to-put-stuff">
<h2>Where to put stuff</h2>
<p>It all depends on when it needs to be run.</p>
<p>If it’s setting / modifying environment variables, it should go in <tt>login</tt>.
If it’s alias or a terminal-specific environment variable (e.g., GREP_COLOR),
it should go in <tt>interactive</tt>.
In my <tt>.shell/env</tt> file, I have my umask set, and also define some useful
functions for modifying colon-separated path environment variables (like
$PATH).</p>
<p>Even if you don’t adopt anything else from my scheme, I’d recommend you take a
look at the what my functions are doing which differs from something like
<tt>export <span>PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That particular pattern is way too common, and is very dangerous if you
consider the case when <tt>$PATH</tt> (or whatever your variable is, like
<tt>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>) isn’t set.
Then, the value will be <tt>:/path/to/dir</tt>, which usually means both
<tt>/path/to/dir</tt> <em>and the current directory</em>, which is usually both unexpected
behaviour and a security concern.</p>
<p>With my implementation (see <tt>.shell/env_functions</tt>), you can append, prepend
and remove directories from any colon-separated environment variable, and when
appending or prepending, you are guaranteed that directory will only then
appear in that variable once.</p>
<p>As a side note, I’m very disappointed in my <tt>indirect_expand()</tt> function,
so if you have a better solution, please let me know (or send me a pull request).</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In order to implement this, you first need an understanding of which startup
files are run in each case.
Of course, this isn’t hard, since all the shells have the same, sensible
system. Ahahaha, no.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’ve read the man pages for you, and drawn a pretty diagram.
To read it, pick your shell, whether it's a login shell, whether it's
interactive, and follow the same colour through the diagram.
When the arrows split out to multiple files, it means that the shell will try
to read each one in turn (working left to right), and will use the first one it
can read.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup.png"></p><p>An important point here is that if you have a non-login, non-interactive shell
running a plain POSIX shell (dash, bash in sh compatibility mode), it <em>won’t
fulfil</em> our contract in that it won’t read <tt>.sh/env</tt>
(and hence <tt>.shell/env</tt>).</p>
<p>The other special case which exists is Bash’s remote shell mode (which is
rather warped), where it tries to detect if it’s running under ssh or rsh (I
assume by looking at the process name of its parent), and if so, follows a
different path, which is indicated on the diagram.</p>
<p>Except that diagram shows what happens according to the man page, and not what
happens when you actually try it out in real life.
This second diagram more accurately captures the insanity of bash:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup-actual.png"></p><p>See how remote interactive login shells read /etc/bash.bashrc, but normal
interactive login shells don’t? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://hg.flowblok.id.au/shell-startup">here’s a repository</a> containing my implementation and the graphviz
files for the above diagram.
If your POSIX-compliant shell isn’t listed here, or if I’ve made a horrible
mistake (or just a tiny one), please send me a pull request or make a comment
below, and I’ll update this post accordingly.</p>

            <p>Since a few month I own an electrical toothbrush from Phillips called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sonicare+HX992B">Sonicare HX992B</a>. It connects to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cdp.ohc.tuscany" title="App">an mobile App</a> using Bluetooth that tells you how well you brushed your teeth, shows the orientation in real-time, and also notifies you when to change the brush for a new one.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/sonicare-image.jpeg" alt="Phillips Sonicare"></p>
            <p>I was curious how this exactly works. Since the application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">nRF Connect</a> app for Android to get a list of advertised services.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/whatsapp-image-2020-10-09-at-19-34-24.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of nRF connect" title="Screenshot of nRF connect"></p>
            <p>Now I had a list of 12 BLE services of which only four are <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/de/specifications/gatt/" title="List of common services">standard services described on bluetooth.com</a>. In addition to well-known services like Generic Access, Generic Attribute, Device Information and Battery Service, also eight custom services exist, that were created by the manufacturer. Every one of the first seven service UUIDs starts with <code>477ea600-a260-11e4-ae37-0002a5d5000</code> and ends with a number from 1 to 8 with number 3 missing. An additional eight service has a completely different prefix than the others.</p>

            <p>By switching the device on and off, changing the strength and mode and also by changing the brush back and forth, I was able to identify some of the characteristics of the six services. By reverse engineering the code of the Android app using <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a> I found information about the session storage and many other things.</p>

            <p>According to the application sources, the last unknown service is called “Moonshine Streaming” and is used to update the firmware. I agreed with myself to not touch this one, since I could damage the firmware and would need to brush my teeth by hand again.</p>
            <p>Since I could see a very course orientation displayed in the app during a cleaning session, I expected orientation data somewhere in the characteristics. I found them in the service <code>5</code>. Once you enable notifications for the <code>4130</code> service, you get a data stream to byte arrays. It turns out, these are indeed the values of the gyroscope.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>You won't go to hell for these, but you should probably look at the manpage. Some programs are just limited, but hey, you can't expect every program to provide a printf function, a date formatter and handling of input from stdin.</p>

<h2 id="Undeclarative%20%3Ccode%3Egrep%3C/code%3E">Undeclarative <code>grep</code></h2>

<p><code>grep</code> is a true power tool in Unix, but can be abused. Here is an example (by me ðŸ˜®):</p>

<p><code>date --date="$(stat "$4/${i%\.html}.md" | grep Modify | cut -d':' -f2-</code></p>

<p>Poor old skuzzymiglet then had no idea about <code>stat --printf</code>, which has useful options for printing times:</p>

<pre><code>%w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
%W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
%x     time of last access, human-readable
%X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
%y     time of last data modification, human-readable
%Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
%z     time of last status change, human-readable
%Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch
</code></pre>

<p>The human-readable dates are fixed-format, so you can just <code>date "your_cool_format" --date="@$(stat --printf="%Y" whatever_you_want)"</code></p>

<p>Generally, a <code>printf</code> like option is useful in programs - it discourages scraping and greatly shortens pipe sequences. But alas, most programs will need to be grepped.</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>

<p>It sounds weird but I believe functions are a shell code smell. The problem is that with a function, you expect paramater names (and types if you're a reasonable person ðŸ˜€). However, you'll find it's just like command-line arguments, and if you don't have the time to use <strong>getopt(1)</strong>, you'll be addressing by index.</p>

<p>Or you could just reassign to variables:</p>

<p><em>(from <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg5</a>)</em></p>

<pre><code>render_sitemap() {
    urls="$1"
    base_url="$2"
    date="$3"

    echo '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;'
    echo '&lt;urlset'
    echo 'xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"'
    echo 'xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9'
    echo 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd"'
    echo 'xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;'
    echo "$urls" |
        sed -E 's#^(.*)$#&lt;url&gt;&lt;loc&gt;'"$base_url"'/\1&lt;/loc&gt;&lt;lastmod&gt;'"$date"'&lt;/lastmod&gt;&lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;&lt;/url&gt;#'
    echo '&lt;/urlset&gt;'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But who would use this?</p>

<pre><code>func render_sitemap(params []string)
</code></pre>

<p>I consider shell function with more than one parameter a contributor to write-only code.</p>

<h2 id="Multiple%20text%20processors">Multiple text processors</h2>

<p>The text processor hierarchy follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>single-purpose: <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code></li>
<li>flat: regexes and sed</li>
<li>text DSLs: Awk</li>
<li>scripting languages: Python, Perl</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you should use <strong>one</strong> and only one of those specified above. Start with the lower-down tool, then instead of adding a command to the pipe use a higher-tier text processor.</p>

<p>In pipes, programming languages get out of hand quickly. Putting everything in quotes and no syntax highlighting is difficult.</p>

<p><em>This list will probably get a few updates in the future. For now, happy scripting!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="root">

<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>I read more often than ever that people are looking for ways to build
their own search engines.</p>
<p>Even if more on more "advanced" features are integrated into search
engines.  They are mostly based on human grunt work.  Semantic search
engine, whatever "semantic" does mean for you, is in fact merely a
couple, not more than a dozen, set of tricks.  I like to say, much of
Google's search engine is good old human labor.  If you still doubt
it, here is again: Google results are not only biased, also they are
editorialized.  Whether algorithms, and their bugs, party is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>My point is: it is human made.  Not some necessarly advanced alien
tool.</p>
<p>The only thing preventing you to have your own search engine is there
is no readily available software, why? because there is no cheap
hardware.</p>
<p>This might sound like a crazy idea five or ten years ago, but with the
advent of AMD threadripper ie. <a href="http://cultureandempire.com/html/cande.html">cost gravity at
play</a> getting together a
personal search engine is, if not a necessity, at least a possibility.</p>
<p>The most common complain I read about Google is that it yields
irrelevant text "that do no even contain my search terms". That is not
a bug, that is a feature!  It seems to me the subtext is that you can
not easily customize Google or whatever search algorithm since it is
privative.  Even retrieving Google search results for further
processing if not forbidden, is at least difficult.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Let's start with the beginning: what is a search engine? A search
engine is software that will <strong>crawl</strong> the Internet, <strong>index</strong>
ie. store the text in a particular format, and that users can
<strong>query</strong> and receive in return the most relevant text.</p>
<p>Let's dive into what "relevant text" means. What is relevant text?</p>
<ol>
<li>A text that contains the search term in my query</li>
<li>A text that has the same topic as my query</li>
<li>A text that gives an answer to my query</li>
</ol>
<p>The good answer is "it depends".  That's why queries have grown from
keywords match like a book index, to boolean queries e.g. <code>"Apple"
-bible</code>, until so called semantic search, which boils down to consider
one-way or two-way synonyms and other lexical features.</p>
<p>So far, I failed to build a crawler that works.  Also much of the text
I am looking for is in wikipedia or StackOverflow for which they are
flat releases which are much more easy to get started than putting
together your own crawler.  Still, they are some crawler around, so
you can use that or learn from it.  I will not dive into the crawler
part because it still hurts when I think about <code>robots.txt</code>,
throttling, text encoding etc... booooh!</p>
<p>So, we will imagine that you have a dataset of plain text, for
instance wikipedia vital articles.  It helps if you know the content
of the dataset.  Querying random news article is not very easy to
grasp because you have to read (!) the text to figure when and how
they are relevant.</p>
<p>Before querying, you need to store the text, but to know <strong>how</strong> to
store the text you need to know which query feature you want. To get
started I will only consider positive keywords and negative keywords
like <code>apple -bible</code>. So, we need to figure which find out which text
contains the word <code>apple</code> but not the word <code>bible</code>. Looking up
everything that does not contain <code>bible</code> is difficult, you would need
to <strong>scan</strong> the whole database to what are those document. Instead we
will look for documents that contains the word <code>apple</code>.  So the
following document contains the word we are looking for:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>define </span><span>doc1</span> <span>"apple is looking for a search engine."</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That is the moment where the most advanced technology of our current
century makes it appearance: the inverted index.  <strong>What is an inverted
index? It reverses the relationship between the document and the word</strong>.
Instead of saying "this document contains the word apple" it says
"apple is contained in this document".  So we might have a procedure
that returns the document identifier that contains <code>apple</code>, like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>contains?</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>inverted-index-lookup</code> returns a list, and that list contains the identifier <code>1</code>
of the first document.  That list might be big. So <strong>you want to consider the least common word from the query</strong>. I call that step
<em>candidates selection</em>.  Also, you might want to convert the positive terms
into lemmas or stems to go toward semantic search, which will mean you need
to store lemmas or stems at index time.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step, given the list of documents that contain the
least common word or term or lemma or stem, is to <strong>filter and score</strong>
according to the full query. In the above case, that is remove the
documents that contains <code>bible</code>.  You can do that step serially, and
it will necessarly take time.  The trick is to use <code>for-each-par-map</code>.
That is a cousin of map-reduce that execute the map procedure in
parallel.</p>
<p>For instance something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>((</span><span>hits</span> <span>'</span><span>()))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>for-each-par-map</span>
    <span>(</span><span>lambda </span><span>(</span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>set! </span><span>hits</span> <span>(</span><span>take</span> <span>10</span> <span>(</span><span>sort</span> <span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>hits</span><span>))))))</span>
    <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>hits</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The score function is interesting. I think going the
<a href="https://github.com/abusix/ahocorapy">aho-corasick</a> with a
<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/converting-boolean-logic-decision-trees-to-finite-state-machines-180ad195abf2">FSM</a>
is the best route because it is easy to implement proximity scoring,
"phrase matching", or really anything I can think of.</p>
<blockquote><p>⚠ That last paragraph is really the most important part of this
post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a gigantic leap that is going to happen in search because of
hardware availability, and free software with readable source ie. the
only thing that makes human progress possible: knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/

function mark {
  ln -sr "$(pwd)" ~/.marks/"$1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> for the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>mark @name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>To list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And to delete a bookmark when it’s no longer needed:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p><code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
First, bookmarks, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain several custom functions and their autocompletion in .bashrc.
And the action for changing directory is always performed using the same familiar <code>cd</code> command, independent of whether the directory is a bookmark or not.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 01 Sep 2020</p>
<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<h2 id="software-versions"><a href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:

</pre>

At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.

<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

</section><p>Early in our mathematical education, we learn about a strong interplay between algebra and geometry—algebraic equations give rise to graphs and geometric figures, and geometric features can be encoded in algebraic expressions. It’s almost as if there’s a portal or bridge connecting these two realms in the grand landscape of mathematics: whatever occurs on one side of the bridge is mirrored on the other.<span id="more-12565"></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=429%2C383" alt="" width="429" height="383" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1024%2C915 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=300%2C268 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=768%2C686 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So although algebra and geometry are very different areas of mathematics, this connection suggests that they are intrinsically related. Incidentally, the `bridge’ that spans them is a but a dim foreshadow of much deeper connections that exist between other branches of mathematics that also may, a priori, seem unrelated: set theory, group theory, linear algebra, topology, graph theory, differential geometry, and more. And what’s amazing is that these relationships—these bridges—are more than just a neat observation. They are <em>mathematics</em>, and that mathematics has a name: <em>category theory</em>.</p>
<h2>What is a category?</h2>
<p>Martin Kuppe once created a wonderful map of the mathematical landscape (see facing page) in which category theory hovers high above the ground, providing a sweeping vista of the terrain. It enables us to see relationships between various fields that are otherwise imperceptible at ground level, attesting that seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics aren’t so different after all. This becomes extraordinarily useful when you want to solve a problem in one realm (topology, say) but don’t have the right tools at your disposal. By ferrying the problem to a different realm (such as group theory), you’re able to see the problem in a different light and perhaps discover new tools that may help the solution become much easier. In fact, this is precisely how category theory came to be. It was birthed in the 1940s in an attempt to answer a difficult topological question by recasting it in an easier, algebraic light.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the mathematical landscape, you’ll notice that each realm consists of some objects (set theory has sets, group theory has groups, topology has topological spaces…) that relate to each other (sets relate via functions, groups relate via homomorphisms, topological spaces relate via continuous functions…) in sensible ways (such as composition and associativity).</p>
<div id="attachment_12568"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12568" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=654%2C520" alt="" width="654" height="520" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=1024%2C814 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=300%2C239 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=768%2C611 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?w=1572 1572w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MathematistanHiresForChalkdust.jpg?w=1308 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-12568">Martin Kuppe’s map of the mathematical landscape (used with permission)</p></div>
<p>This common thread weaves throughout the landscape and unites the various fields. The mathematics of category theory formalises this unification. More concretely, a <em>category</em> is a collection of <em>objects</em> with relationships between them (called <em>morphisms</em>) that behave nicely in terms of <em>composition</em> and <em>associativity</em>. This provides a template for mathematics, and depending on what you feed into that template, you’ll recover one of the mathematical realms: the category of sets consists of sets and relationships (ie functions) between them; the category of groups consists of groups and relationships (ie group homomorphisms) between them; the category of topological spaces consists of topological spaces and relationships (ie continuous functions) between them; and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=654%2C113" alt="" width="654" height="113" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=1024%2C177 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=300%2C52 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=768%2C132 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?resize=6%2C1 6w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/objects.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The analogy between a category and a template is due to Barry Mazur from his wonderfully written, non-technical introduction to category theory, <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>When is one thing equal to some other thing?</em></a> In it he writes, “This concept of category is an omni-purpose affair… There is hardly any species of mathematical object that doesn’t fit into this convenient, and often enlightening, template.” Indeed, as category theorist <a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/interviews/in-conversation-with-eugenia-cheng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eugenia Cheng</a> so aptly put it in her treatise <a href="http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/misc/4000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Higher-dimensional category theory</em></a>, “category theory is the mathematics of mathematics”.</p>
<h2>It’s all about relationships</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=498%2C401" alt="" width="498" height="401" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1024%2C826 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=300%2C242 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=768%2C619 768w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?w=1048 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>One of the main features of category theory is that it strips away a lot of detail: it’s not really concerned with the individual elements in your set, or whether or not your group is solvable, or if your topological space has a countable basis. So you might be thinking, “Eh, category theory sounds so abstract. Can any good come from this?” Happily, the answer is yes! An advantage of ignoring details is that our attention is diverted away from the individual objects and turned towards the relationships—the morphisms—that exist between them. And as any category theorist will tell you, <em>relationships are everything.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, one of the main maxims of category theory is that <em>a mathematical object is completely determined by its relationships to all other objects</em>. To put it another way, two objects are essentially indistinguishable if and only if they relate to every object in the category in the same way. This theme (which is a consequence of a famous result called the Yoneda lemma) isn’t too different from what we observe in life. You can learn a lot about people by looking at their relationships—their Facebook friends, who they follow on Twitter, who they hang out with on Friday nights, for instance. And if you ever meet two people who have the <em>exact same</em> set of friends, and whose interactions on social media are <em>exactly the same</em>, and who hang out with the <em>exact same</em> people on Friday nights, then you might jokingly say, “You can’t even tell them apart”. Category theory informs us that, all jokes aside, this is actually true mathematically!</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=360%2C183" alt="" width="360" height="183" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=1024%2C521 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=300%2C152 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=768%2C390 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?resize=2%2C1 2w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arrows.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
So you might wonder “Hmm, if mathematical relationships are <em>that</em>&nbsp;important, then what about relationships between categories? Do <em>they</em>&nbsp;exist?” Great question. The answer is: absolutely! In fact, these particular relationships have a name—they are called <em>functors</em>. But why stop there? What about the relationships between those relationships? They, too, have a name: <em>natural transformations.</em></p>
<p>In fact, we can keep on going: “What about the relationships between the relationships between the relationships between the…?” Doing so will land us in higher-dimensional category theory, which is where much of Cheng’s research lies.</p>
<p>As abstract as this may sound, these constructions—categories, functors, and natural transformations—comprise a treasure trove of theory that shows up almost everywhere, in mathematics <em>and</em> in other disciplines! Since its inception, category theory has found natural applications in computer science, quantum physics, systems biology, chemistry, dynamical systems, and natural language processing, just to name a few. (The <a href="http://appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops">website</a> `Applied category theory’ contains a list of applications.) So even though category theory might sound a little abstract, it is highly applicable. And that’s no surprise. Category theory is all about relationships, and so is the world around us!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Categories are a little bit like anchovies: some folks love ’em, while for other folks they’re an acquired taste. So yes, it’s true that category theory may not help you find a delta for your epsilon, or determine if your group of order 520 is simple, or construct a solution to your PDE. For those endeavours, we do have to put our feet back on the ground. But thinking categorically can help serve as a beacon—it can strengthen your intuition and sharpen your insight—as you trek through the nooks and crannies of your favourite mathematical realms. And these days it’s especially hard to escape the pervasiveness of category theory throughout modern mathematics. So whatever your mathematical goals may be, learning a bit about categories will be well worth your time!</p>

<p>(alternate title: Rationalizing writing pointless shell scripts)</p>
<p>You should create your own blog and start writing. At lest that's what people who write blogs say. Apparently there is something good about creating things of something. So let's give it a try.</p>
<p>However in order to start a blog one must first have a some kind of a blogging platform. The sane way to do this would be to use your search engine of choice and research the available solutions in order to find one that sounds the most appealing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately before I could do that I had two very bad thoughts that stuck in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If it's about the joy of creation, why not also create the blogging platform?</em></li>
<li><em>Wait, wouldn't it be cool if my publishing command was <code>git push</code> and then Git hooks took care of the rest?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The result, surprisingly, is somewhat usable.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>As a good little software engineer I began by listing some requirements upfront before I even started to write code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to work offline.</li>
<li>Publishing via <code>git push</code> + some server hooks.</li>
<li>Being able to deploy locally for previews.</li>
<li>Generating static pages.</li>
<li>Being able to write in Markdown or directly in HTML.</li>
<li>Generating an Atom/RSS feed automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn't sound too bad, right? So let's see what came out of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>In the end I got the whole thing running with three short(-ish) scripts, lets look at the first one:</p>
<p><strong>deploy.sh:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BASE=$(pwd)
TARGET=${TARGET:-~/target}
HEADER=$BASE/header.html
FOOTER=$BASE/footer.html

rm -rf "{$TARGET:?}"/*
find * -type d ! -path '\.\/\.*' -print | xargs -I DIR  sh -c "mkdir -p $TARGET/DIR; HEADER=$HEADER FOOTER=$FOOTER ./indexer.sh DIR $TARGET/DIR"

find . -type f -name '*md' -print | sed 's/md$//' | xargs -I NAME  sh -c " { cat $HEADER; pandoc $BASE/NAMEmd; cat $FOOTER; } &gt; $TARGET/NAMEhtml; echo $TARGET/NAMEhtml"

find . -type f ! -path '\.\/\.*' ! -name '*md' -print | grep -v -E "footer.html|header.html|index-header.html|$0|indexer.sh|feed-header.xml" | xargs -I NAME cp "$BASE/NAME" "$TARGET/NAME"</code></pre>
<p>Initially I imagined it would look a bit prettier but oh well. Essentially it's an uglier way to say:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Remove whatever was last deployed. (Pray that it would not <code>rm -rf /</code>)</li>
<li>Index every directory.</li>
<li>Parse every Markdown into HTML and insert it between the header and footer.</li>
<li>Copy any other arbitrary files which are not used in the previous steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lovingly step number 3 uses a hard-coded list. I'm sure that won't bite me in the future.</p>
<p>However there is one fun thing about indexing. If we remove the first <code>find</code> line from most "important" features of a blog will still function - you would still be able to write and publish. The indexing is "only" for generating the update feed and creating a little landing page where visitors of the blog could see all articles in a list, sorted with the most recent first - that detail is important. So let's talk about indexing now.</p>
<h2 id="indexing---the-8020-rule">Indexing - the 80/20 rule</h2>
<p>The <code>./indexer.sh</code> script mention in the last code block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

HOME="https://rilia.xyz/"
HTML_OUT=$2/index.html
ATOM_OUT=$2/feed.atom

feed_entry() {
  echo "
    &lt;entry&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;$3&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link href=\"${HOME}${1}.html\"/&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;${HOME}${1}.html&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;updated&gt;$2&lt;/updated&gt;
      &lt;content type=\"xhtml\"&gt;
$(pandoc $4)
      &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;"
}

html_entry() {
  echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/$1.html\"&gt;$3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; - $(echo $2 | sed 's/\ .*$//')&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"
}

cat "$HEADER" "$1"/index-header.html &gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;div class=feed&gt; &lt;a href=feed.atom&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"

cat "$1"/feed-header.xml &gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
date --rfc-3339=seconds &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
echo '&lt;/updated&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair
do
  date=$(echo $pair | sed 's/\ .*$//')
  f=$(echo $pair | sed 's/^.*\ //')
  timestamp=$(date --date=@"$date" --rfc-3339=seconds)
  title=$(grep -m 1 -e '^#\ ' "$f" | sed 's/^#\ \ *//')
  location=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/\.md$//' | sed 's/^\.\///')

  feed_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" "$f" &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
  html_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
done

cat "$FOOTER" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;/feed&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

echo "$HTML_OUT"
echo "$ATOM_OUT"
</code></pre>
<p>Whelp... Can't really sugar coat that one, it's ugly. Fun side note, you might have heard bout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>. One way to interpret it is that around 80% of the effort contributes to 20% of the final result. It doesn't really say that but bear with me: the two scripts are in total roughly 63 lines of code, from which <code>indexer.sh</code> is 51. That means that the indexing code is roughly 81% of the code base and probably of the total effort as well. Why was indexing difficult? Well it turns out that under Linux you cannot easily see the creating date of a file. You can do it under *BSD or Windows but the Linux kernel does not export some property of ext4 or something<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I <em>could</em> migrate the server to *BSD or try to get a better version of the <code>stat</code> core utility. Luckily since I was already using git repo to hold the blog files I had a workaround<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, let's take a closer look at the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair</code></pre>
<p>From the <code>git-log</code> manual it says that <code>%at</code> will display the "author date, UNIX timestamp". Therefore we can sort files based by querying when each one was added to the git repository. Probably very inefficient but it gets the job done and it works without any side effects. An alternative might be to use hooks that fire off on commits and appends the filename of the new files to a list. It would probably provide a good optimization for the total time it takes to update everything. The thing that worries me about that is that you would need to keep the list synchronised locally and with the server and also to try not to lose it. Perhaps the file could be part of the git repo? Possible optimizations for the future. At my current scale (one blog post) it doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2 id="the-git-hook">The Git Hook</h2>
<p>That one turned out easier than I expected, not much to say about it:</p>
<p><strong>post-update:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

unset GIT_INDEX_FILE

rm -rf /tmp/deploy
mkdir -p /tmp/deploy
GIT_DIR='/var/git/rilia.git'
git --work-tree=/tmp/deploy checkout -f
(cd /tmp/deploy; TARGET='/var/www/rilia' ./deploy.sh)</code></pre>
<h2 id="benefits-of-doing-it-this-way">Benefits of doing it this way</h2>
<p>I'm not sure but there might be some merit to using Git for a blogging platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively few dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course ignoring the big one - git, but I already wanted to have a private git server anyway so it was easily justifiable. Also for Markdown I use <code>pandoc</code>, but you could try some simpler tool or even a different templating language, <code>htlatex</code> is a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>No active server</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point I checked <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> since I overheard it was a good choice for making static sites. However configuration files scare me as well as having another server process active all the time. The git repo solution runs only on updates.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mkws.sh/">mkws</a> which looks like a cool project, but I learned about it after being mostly done with the scripts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I dunno, make stuff or something. Generating HTML is not <em>that</em> difficult so if the idea of making your own platform sounds appealing just go for it. Writing the scripts was somewhat fun even if I'm not a big fan of the POSIX shell syntax. In the end you might find a novel way to do a relatively simple thing and on its own that could be fun.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	<p>I kinda hate myself for writing this post like a revelation in the times of pandemic and talking about remote work while it is <em>hot topic</em> . In reality, I have been working 100% remotely for more than 2 years (I previously worked for more than 8 years in the offices) and right now I feel I can tell my experiences about remote work and why I will probably never go back to a regular office job.</p>
<p>Around 2 years ago I got the offer to join MailerLite as a remote contractor. I was over-thinking whether I should start working remotely, what would it mean for me, my habits, social life, and my career progress. There were too many unknowns at that point as I have only done some freelance gigs remotely, but have been involved with distributed teams all over the world in previous companies. I took the red pill and my remote journey began.</p>
<p>All my doubts were cleared right away.</p>
<p>The first one - traffic. I hate the traffic in Belgrade. The city isn’t building its infrastructure (roads, bridges) as fast as it is growing and it is showing. On a good day, it took around 30 minutes of driving to work, which is not a problem. But, in the majority of days going to work and back home took on average 2 hours. I say 2 hours because you have to take into account that you have to find a parking space, probably 10 minutes from the office, and then walk to the office which all adds to 2 hours of lost time each day. If you calculate - it means that you are losing <strong>22 days per year</strong> in the traffic.</p>
<p>What could you do with that extra <em>time</em> that you have? I remember one analogy when I talked to one of my friends as he said: “It is like when people are telling that smokers could put all money they spend on cigarettes aside and can buy a new car after some time of saving. Then you see people who stopped smoking and after some time you don’t see them with a new car”. That wasn’t the case for me. I rediscovered hobbies that I have stopped practicing because of lack of time - started playing guitar more, recording new music, and most importantly, I had time to read more non-business related books. You can become dull and get into a work-home-sleep routine because of the lack of time.</p>
<p>Micromanagement was the other thing that I thought could happen in remote work. Fortunately, it didn’t. It is just a matter if you trust your employees or not. If you don’t trust your employees, you either didn’t hire the right people for your company or you are suffering from trust issues and adapting to the situation. Usually, it is the second thing. People who slack off because there aren’t any measures of control because they are working remotely show their faces and bad habits really fast and you can easily filter them.</p>
<p>When working remotely, <strong>you are your own manager</strong>. You must plan your time and goals, and how much you give yourself to work. Not too little and not too much, balance, as always, is the key.</p>
<p>There are so many tools to make communication while working remotely easy. We utilize Slack, have regular calls on Zoom, write our monthly feedback on 15five, and much more. If we need to brainstorm, we get on a video call or write in Slack.</p>
<p>There is one potential downside of working remotely for one target group - junior engineers. I will explain why I don’t think it is a rule but purely depends on the person. While junior engineers can always sit next to their mentors in a regular office job, here it is a bit different. Your company has to have really good documentation and processes so they don’t get lost. But, on the other hand, at MailerLite we are always looking for persons that are “self-starters” and can pick-up things themselves without or with minimal interference from other colleagues. In my experience, juniors can struggle at the beginning for the first (half of) year, but after that, they are usually stronger with knowledge and work ethics than juniors in regular offices. They are more independent in work and can easily learn new things and implement them.</p>
<p>The key thing in remote work is overcommunication. I can’t stress enough how much it is important. As a pitfall of remote work, you must write and overshare because there is no such thing as over-communication. Why do we do that? We are a remote-first company, but we have an office in Vilnius if someone wants to work from it. A couple of people are working from the office, but as I have been there a couple of times it is the most silent office I have ever been in. The communication is done via Slack or conference calls with everyone, so no one is left out, as this can be a problem when you have a combination of office and remote work in your company.</p>
<p>Productivity, personally, is sky-rocketing once I switched to the remote. I get at least 50% more stuff done as there are no distractions, unnecessary small-talks, listening to office gossips, braggings, and other things that can happen in the office.</p>
<p>Freedom is also an important thing. Sometimes I have to do something personal in the morning, or the middle of the day. Sometimes, I can go to the gym during the day and go back refreshed and start working. I can go to my hometown when I want to and work from there. I can travel wherever I want and work from there. I have become more social as I have more time for my friends and family and am less stressed. No one is looking at how much time you are spending working - but if you did the task or not which is the only important thing.</p>
<p>The biggest indicator that remote work is a benefit for both an employee and the company is that Microsoft and Google are now permanently remote if you want to. Pandemic nudged them in that direction, but they have seen the benefits and adapted.</p>
<p>Times are changing. Gosh, what a cliche sentence. <strong>Times are always changing, it is up to us if we want to adapt</strong>. Remote work has been around for a long time, but most of the companies resisted the change. I’m happy that companies are now forced to change because it requires a change of mindset, but there is a quote from my favourite TV series of all time, Twin Peaks, <em>“There’s some fear in letting go”</em>.</p>

<p>This is going to be a short walk in the product development zoo, I hope you’ll enjoy the ride!</p>
<p><em>Caveat</em>: what you’ll read about are (usually) not personality types but behaviors in a specific (type of) situation. Acting like a HIPPO, a WOLF, a RHINO or a ZEBRA doesn’t make anyone a bad person. You’re still a team, aim to understand where they are coming from, and, well, they might even be right, with the wrong communication style. </p>

<p>It can be tempting to give in to the HIPPOs – founders or CEO or VPS who want to make all the decisions – but don’t let them steer you off course.</p>
<p>Bring everything back to your vision and objectives. If the HIPPOs aren’t aligned with those, you could be headed for dangerous waters.</p>
<p>Don’t let your HiPPO kill your ideas – inform them with data and make them a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-driven HiPPO</a>! </p>

<h2>The WOLF – Working On the Latest Fire</h2>

<p>The WOLF has a short attention span and a temptation to jump from one problem to the next. They tend to only enjoy fighting fires, This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for your competitors.</p>
<p>Create a process for collecting feedback about problems, bugs and only consider these along with all other requests. Set up triaging and set clear priorities and a method for prioritization.</p>

<p>The RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they are not helping much either. </p>
<p>Having a clearly defined prioritization process can help ensure all your team members understand how decisions are made and give them the confidence to actively participate. Hopefully, in this process, everyone is empowered to have a say and it doesn’t turn into “Well our process is that the boss tells you what’s important” – which is exactly how you end up with a team of disillusioned RHINOs.</p>

<p>ZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence. To stave off the ZEBRAs in your midst, make sure that you’ve got data to back up your decisions.</p>
<p>Come up with quick experiments you can run to test ideas and gather evidence. Push for a data-driven culture.</p>

<h2>And one extra…. the RHINO again! This time, Really High value New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a salesperson with an amazing value customer deal for an unplanned feature insisting re-allocating resources to build what’s required to win the deal. The results, sadly, are an ignored strategy and roadmap and resources allocated to serve a single customer.</p>
<p>There are two ways here:</p>
<p>1, Chase the RHINO away: Compare the opportunity cost and value and argue against signing the deal if you have customer insight supporting the roadmap.<br>2, Tame the RHINO: Adjust the roadmap if the opportunity includes features you already had planned for later in the year.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I remotely login to some Linux computers or use Docker containers, I would find the shell is plain black and white, different from the colorful shell I am used to dealing with on my local machine. This sometimes makes it difficult to look for libraries, executables, and folders. Sometimes, some executables could be called directly from a local shell but from a remote login shell they are not directly callable.</p>



<p>It turns out that the shell is an executable and it is “configured” by special shell scripts such as <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss the differences between these scripts.</p>

<h3 id="bashrc">~/.bashrc</h3>

<p>I modify the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file from time to time, because sometimes I would like to set some environment variables, including <code>PATH</code> which is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search when looking for executable files. But I have been ignoring the commented block at its beginning for decades.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.bashrc 
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that in a local shell where <code>bash</code> is being used, this shell script will be executed immediately after <code>bash</code> is executed. There are many other shell executable variants, such as <code>zsh</code>. <code>~/.bashrc</code> is only specific to <code>bash</code>.</p>



<p>There are many settings in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> that makes the shell look colorful. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="profile">~/.profile</h3>

<p>The comment block found in the <code>~/.profile</code> explicitly tells us that it will be executed for the login shells. However, if <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> exists, <code>~/.profile</code> will not be executed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default content of the <code>~/.profile</code> is simple. In most cases, it inherits whatever is in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and adds some user specific executable filepath to the environment variable <code>PATH</code>. So if there are commands that make the shell look colorful in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, the login shell should also look colorful.</p>

<h3 id="bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in most of my login trials, the shells were never colorful, and sometimes the environment variables did not match my expectation. In those cases, this is because there exists a <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and therefore <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> is never executed. Usually the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> will be empty, which means that we would not have the environment and appearance that we have in our local shell.</p>



<p>To make the login shell “back to normal”, we could either delete the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or modify the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> by adding some commands like</p>



<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a non-color shell could be helpful. It can be used to indicate that you are not working in local shell, and that what you are seeing could either be a Docker shell or a remote login shell. When we know what shell we are dealing with, we will be more likely to avoid dangerous operations. For example, in a Docker shell, we could do almost anything, such as <code>rm -rf /</code> without sudo, without harming the local system.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Liam Keane from Hacker News for correcting the grammars and polishing the words in the blog post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>You’re a developer working on the Foobar feature at company X. Unbeknownst to you, Genghis, the company CEO, just had dinner with other industry leaders and became excited about this new thing called Beezlyboo. Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage. We assume that reporting edges correspond to lines of communication and that members of a team are fully connected in complete graphs.</p></div></d-figure></figure><p>The benefits are clear. When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<sup>1</sup> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all.

You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<sup>2</sup> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad. The way we organize ourselves in companies will change because young people like me communicate in new and different ways.</p><p>The first wave of startups attempting to tackle this — like <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team (KYT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>, <a href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, <a href="https://withcadence.io/">Cadence</a>, and a handful of others — are already well on their way.</p><p>Let's take KYT as an example.

Backed by years of research and a kick-ass CEO in <a href="https://clairelew.com/">Claire Lew</a>, KYT is a great example of a company pushing the envelope of how we think about management.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>If middle managers in today’s corporations are obsessed with airport books and ways of organizing people, then the true organizational geeks are military commanders and theorists.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>A friend at a prominent tech company took last month off using their new covid policy. When he got back to work last week, he was horrified. Not to see that things had fallen apart in his absence, but to realize that they hadn’t. Overwhelmingly, life without him had continued as normal.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. A company dependent on a single person’s work has a single point of failure. In tech jargon, they have low Bus Factor, the number of people who would have to get hit by a bus for the project to fail. The higher your Bus Factor, the greater your institutional resilience.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to reconcile this experience with faith in an impactful career. If a firing squad executes a prisoner, we can say that each shooter is sufficient but not necessary. The success of the project depends on the shooters in aggregate, but not on any person in particular.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why an organization might want this kind of redundancy. Sure, it’s wasteful and inefficient, but it prevents the greatest threat to any company: giving employees leverage.</p>
<h3 id="The-Misery-of-Redundancy"><a href="#The-Misery-of-Redundancy" title="The Misery of Redundancy"></a>The Misery of Redundancy</h3><p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably well versed on sublinear returns to headcount. You know about the Mythical Man-Month, and understand that communication scales quadratically. You shudder at the thought of growing complexity.</p>
<p>But the untold story isn’t about efficiency, it’s about negative returns to engagement. One person on a project is personally responsible. Two people might manage to coordinate. Beyond that, you’re in the endless hellscape of team projects.</p>
<p>Remember the last time you were assigned partners in school? A team project is a game of chicken. Each participant signals their willingness to fail through procrastination, until finally at the last minute someone defects and does all the work. The more you care, the more you lose.</p>
<p>(At least those projects ended. As a friend once put it, the weirdest thing about working at large companies is that you’ll wake up one morning, have a new teammate randomly assigned to you, and proceed to see them 8 hours a day every day until one of you quits or dies.)</p>
<p>This is the world of high Bus Factor. The greater a project’s supposed “resilience”, the more each person becomes dispensable. Sufficient, but not necessary.</p>
<p>(Even if you’re working in a mission-driven company, your job is meaningless unless you’re personally responsible for the success of that mission. The US Government might be the single more important organization in the world. How do you think it feels to work as an entry level bureaucrat?)</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you spend so much time writing design docs and detailed PRs? Or why you’re constantly stuck in meetings explaining what you do to various groups of people? Or why your project has a separate engineer, EM, PM, Designer and Tech Lead? Maybe these are best practices, maybe we’ve all settled on the right way of doing things.</p>
<p>But they’re also ways of making sure that if you get hit by a bus, no one has to care.</p>
<h3 id="Self-Reinforcing-Churn"><a href="#Self-Reinforcing-Churn" title="Self-Reinforcing Churn"></a>Self-Reinforcing Churn</h3><p>Every large tech company runs performance reviews twice a year. Don’t ask me why, it’s the way things have always been done.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the average tenure at these companies hovers at around 2 years.</p>
<p>That means that at any given point, fully one quarter of your teammates are totally checked out.</p>
<p>On the high end, there are people who know they’re leaving in the next year, and just have absolutely no reason to care. If you’re at the beginning of a new review cycle, you’re 6 months away from getting PIP’d, which means you’re 12 months away from getting fired.</p>
<p>Odds are, you’re going to lose the game of chicken. You might not have the most to lose, but unless you’re also quitting next cycle, you certainly don’t have the least.</p>
<p>For the employer, the upshot is that anyone can quit at any time. If you’re on a 12 person team, you might lose 3 people each half. The only viable response is to up the Bus Factor, layer on more redundancy, and limit the importance of each individual.</p>
<p>Of course, the irony is that it’s precisely this sense of replaceability that drives churn in the first place! The more employees are alienated, the more willing they are to leave as soon as their equity vests.</p>
<p>So this ends up being a vicious cycle where higher churn forces a higher Bus Factor, which causes alienation, which increases churn, and so on until you either die or become Oracle.</p>
<h3 id="Escaping-the-Labyrinth"><a href="#Escaping-the-Labyrinth" title="Escaping the Labyrinth"></a>Escaping the Labyrinth</h3><p>The flip side is that there’s still hope.</p>
<p>Since the cycle is self-reinforcing, we can break it in the middle and slay the ouroboros. There’s historical path dependence, but no fundamental reason we have to live this way.</p>
<p>The alternative to redundancy isn’t fragility, it’s personal responsibility. It’s keeping your Bus Factor low.</p>
<p>In this world, you can develop specific mastery instead of a broad assortment of skills. You can be a craftsman instead of a code monkey, understand systems deeply instead of cargo culting best practices.</p>
<p>Imagine working at a company where every single one of your coworkers gives a shit. Imagine knowing that your contributions are important, that the world is different because of your existence.</p>
<p>That’s Bus Factor 1.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is basically how SpaceX works. It’s not a coincidence that they’re <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/top-tech-companies-compared">ranked #1 for both stress and sense of meaning</a>. If you hear that employees are overworked and underpaid, don’t cry abuse, ask how they’re getting compensated instead.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h3><p><strong>Why exactly does leverage even matter?</strong><br><em>A priori</em>, it shouldn’t. If all employees have leverage, there’s nothing to negotiate for. You could ask for more money, but everyone else could too, eventually the company falls apart and you all lose.</p>
<p>But <em>a posteriori</em>, we can work backwards from behavior. If companies are willing to sacrifice efficiency, that is itself evidence of exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds crazy. If engineers are actually underpaid, why don’t they just go somewhere else? Why doesn’t the market raise salaries?</strong><br>I’ve screened resumes from entry level engineers who claim to have saved their companies millions of dollars. The crazy part is that I believe it! If you can make even the smallest change to a ranking algorithm, or improve the performance of a costly computation, or run an experiment that marginally increases click-through rate, the effects multiply out across a huge user base.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t know a single entry level engineer getting paid commensurately.</p>
<p>First, there’s a lack of counterfactual impact. Sure, you saved the company a million dollars, but if you didn’t take the job someone else would, and they would have done the same work.</p>
<p>Your impact looks huge, but in a high Bus Factor world, your actual impact is just the delta between your ability and the next best engineer. You might be able to negotiate another $10k, but not two orders of magnitude more.</p>
<p>Second, you don’t own the means of production. Your skills are only worth millions of dollars in the particular context of this company. You can’t walk away and produce that value on your own. You depend on the company much more than it depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>Hmm, maybe, but if firms have so much market power, why don’t they just keep Bus Factor low but set a strong precedent against adversarial negotiation?</strong><br>Great question. Since companies are good at internal coordination, and employees are bad at collective bargaining, firms ought to be able to keep salaries low even without increasing the Bus Factor.</p>
<p>You could just wait for someone to speak up, immediately fire them, take whatever financial hit comes from their project’s failure, but set the precedent for any future dissidents that negotiation is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The problem is, firms don’t handle negotiations, managers do, and their incentives are just as screwed up as yours. A manager stands to lose their career if too many projects fail, but it costs them nothing to advocate for your promotion. So in a low Bus Factor world, the tendency is always to default to generosity.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this happen at SpaceX? Remember, none of this is actually about salaries or promotions, it’s about sociopathically pursuing leverage as an alternative to fulfilment when you have no other choices. This is all conditional on not being treated like a human, and not having a meaningful job.</p>
<p>In Bus Factor 1 world, you have too much personal responsibility to coast on momentum or free ride on a teammate’s accomplishments. More importantly, you might actually personally care.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t running a company as Bus Factor 1 invite risk?</strong><br>Absolutely. SpaceX has blown up rockets. Tesla has missed deadlines. Neuralink is doing god knows what.</p>
<p>But management science, financial engineering and organizational design are filled with countless other methods for deferring risk.</p>
<p><strong>Okay fine, I’m sold, where do I sign up?</strong><br>Pretty much nowhere!</p>
<p>I’ve asked every friend, accepted every cold call from recruiters, and as far as I can tell, nearly no companies or even individual teams are run with Bus Factor 1. Again, maybe SpaceX, but I’m relaying that second hand.</p>
<p>If you find out, let me know. Or better yet, start it yourself and tell me!</p>

<article id="post-193">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re a brilliant engineer who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A poorly-designed take-home, requiring skills that you don’t have and won’t need for the job, and that you spend hours thinking through and working on, send in, and get rejected without getting any feedback.</li></ul>



<p>Probably neither.</p>



<p><strong>So …</strong></p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

</pre></div><p>This allows me to keep my downstream project up to date with the template. When I discover another tool, this can be merged into the downstream project for example. It allows evolving the template over time as I learn more about whatever programming language I’m&nbsp;using.</p><p>It also gives me default branding. Which makes it look more ‘professional’. Although I don’t like branding, I know this is necessary. Having it there by default makes it so that I don’t forget to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>When starting a project you also gain some free authoritativeness, because you have a longer commit history the project looks like it is more mature. Although this practice is a little deceptive, there is a core of truth, because the template has gotten a lot of attention. If you feel offended by this practice, ask yourself first, why are you trusting git histories? These can be <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">rewritten anyway</a>. This authoritativeness also gives me a small moral boost. It just <em>feels</em> better to have a project with well thought out tools being started and some history rather then the ‘normal’ stuff everyone starts&nbsp;with.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The alternatives are using tools that spit out templates. In the haskell world these are <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates">stack new</a>, <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#using-cabal-init">cabal init</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/summoner">summoner</a>. These tools are simply a glorified <code>sed</code> on projects folders: They find and replace variables. There is no versioning, there is no personalization except what limited variables&nbsp;give.</p><p>Because these tools don’t take into account history, the first commit will be a large commit with a message like ‘Initial’. I find this problematic because it squashes all the work that went into creating the template. Information is lost, for no&nbsp;reason.</p><p>These tools don’t use git to track their templates. They could, but they don’t. Maybe they wanted to be <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">2</a></sup> agnostic? I’m speculating, but even if you wanted to be that, you could still use any version system to track the template and recreate the history in the <span>VCS</span> desired by the user. This at least gives the user their history of the template back. While also giving them the choice of <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">3</a></sup></p><h2 id="a-template-hierarchy">A template&nbsp;hierarchy</h2><p>What I described in the intro can be taken a step further. A template of a template can be used to create another new template. For example, say you’re a fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/">nix</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make</a>, so why not put a makefile and a <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html#pinning-nixpkgs">nix pin</a> in some template of templates project. These tools don’t care about which language you use, so their configuration can be shared among Python, Java and Haskell projects for example. Maybe for github it could even have a partial travis or github actions <span>CI</span>&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Now, say you’re starting a new Python project, but have no template yet for that programming language. You simply clone this template of templates and customize it to your own <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean#:~:text=Pythonic%20means%20code%20that%20doesn,is%20intended%20to%20be%20used.">Pythonic</a> needs. You can still pull in the upstream changes from your template of templates, for example to upgrade the nix pin. The big advantage of course is that a change in the template of templates can easily merged into all downstream projects with&nbsp;git.</p><p>I convinced the reader that using git is the superior way for template management. It’s simpler, and more flexible. I also convinced the authors of stack, cabal and summoner to drop their current way of managing templates and use git&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Or, more likely, no-one read this&nbsp;far.</p></div><small></small></article><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64-encoding</a> is ubiquitous in our
modern world. Many programs communicate in base64-encoded messages, since these
have nice properties: They consist of a very limited subset of ASCII characters,
and can thus be displayed as text. E-Mails for example are commonly encoded in
base64 in transfer, which can be seen in the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header.</p>

<p>Where I volunteer we have a tradition of putting <code>changeme</code> as a placeholder for
many template variables indicating that they should be overwritten later. Thus,
if we later still see <code>changeme</code> anywhere we know that somewhere somebody must
have forgotten to specify a variable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these template variables should correspond to base64-encoded content,
i.e. the base64-decoding of said variable should produce meaningful content. But
what happens if somebody forgets to define said variable, and it is substituted
with<code>changeme</code> instead? I always thought that it would fail to
decode the string since the probability that <code>changeme</code> is actually valid base64
encoding must be very low. But lo and behold, this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d
r�[1m
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>hexdump</code> on the output we can identify the characters:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  72 16 a7 81 e9 9e      |r.....|
00000006
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly nonsense, but the second byte is interesting: It is an ASCII control
character <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, meaning trips up all sorts of programs which expect to read
printable ASCII characters, such as JSON deserializers.</p>

<p>This bug actually occurred when I was migrating some applications between
different Kubernetes clusters: In the old cluster the application ran without
problems, but I forgot to specify some variable in the new cluster, and it lead
to Go complaining about non-ASCII characters in a JSON string.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is: If you use dummy values be sure that they
cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

I found an odd email in my inbox yesterday from a company claiming ownership of a Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ivy/">Ivy</a>, that I registered on the Python Package Index back in August 2016, more than four years ago. The company is claiming ownership of the package on the basis of a <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">UK trademark</a> on the word "ivy" filed in August 2020.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full text of the email:
</p>
<div>
<p>
Dear Mr. Mulholland,
</p>
<p>
We are genuinely sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but we are writing
after following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">advice</a> on
the PyPI website. We would kindly like to request that the "ivy" package name be released from PyPI, on the grounds that it violates our <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">trademark</a>.
PyPI lists <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#invalid-projects">trademark violation</a> as grounds to invalidate a project on PyPI, with subsequent removal. If you would be more comfortable waiting for official involvement of PyPI before releasing the name, then we will gladly <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">open a new issue</a> with PyPI.
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this request.
</p>
<p>
Kind Regards,<br>
The Ivy Team

I have no idea what this company does, they didn't link to their website, but they probably sell yoga mats judging from the stretchiness of this stretch.

Name Shortages and Namespacing
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately the Python Package Index uses a single flat namespace for all packages so the name famine is a real and growing problem. I've been disappointed all too many times myself to find that a name I wanted to use was occupied by an abandoned project that hadn't been touched in years. (This isn't the case for <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy">Ivy</a> which is being actively developed.)
</p>
<p>
The problem must be getting serious as the Package Index's maintainers have introduced a set of formal guidelines and processes (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>) for arbitrating disputes over package names — I certainly don't envy them the task.
I think the long-term solution instead is to introduce namespacing by username so packages like <code>dmulholl/ivy</code> and <code>yogamasters/ivy</code> can happily coexist.
</p>
<p>
I've actually been approached several times over the years by people wanting control over the <code>ivy</code> package. Usually they offer to buy it from me — this is the first time I've been threatened with a trademark. It'll be interesting to see how the Package Index maintainers handle the dispute.

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Since we got our hands on the new Raspberry Pi 4, we started exploring how
various virtualization technologies behave on the board. First thing we tried is how to run <a href="https://cloudkernels.github.io/posts/rpi4-64bit-virt/">Nabla</a> on it and how it compares to native KVM.</p>

<p>Next thing we wanted to try is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">firecracker</a>, the notorious micro-VMM that
Amazon Lambda &amp; Fargate run on. To our disappointment, firecracker was not
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1196">yet</a> running on RPi4. So we started looking into coding in the necessary
changes :)</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation, we figured out that the key missing piece is
support for the GICv2 ARM interrupt controller. In fact, firecracker only
supports GIC version 3 since it was open-sourced, but not version 2, which is
the version appearing in the Raspberry Pi series, as well as in other popular
boards, like the Hikey 970 we got our hands on, or Khadas VIM3. A bit more
digging into the internals of firecracker and the Linux kernel, helped us
work out the details and open a <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1235">pull-request</a> which adds support for the
missing parts.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-firecracker">Changes in Firecracker</h4>

<p>The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is the IP block in the ARM processors
that implements interrupt handling. The Linux kernel supports user- and
kernel-space emulation for GICv2 as well as GICv3 and v4. However, Firecracker
only handles the GICv3-related configuration of the virtual GIC (VGIC).
Similarly, setting up the FDT for the guest microVM from Firecracker only
handles GIC-v3 devices.</p>

<p>In terms of code organization, the GIC related code currently exposes a function
for setting up GICv3 performing the corresponding <code>ioctl</code> KVM commands. The
first part of our PR changes this by introducing a GIC Trait which defines the
common interface for all GIC implementations. Even though it is still under
discussion, what exactly will be in the Trait in its final form, it will be
something along the following lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/// Trait for GIC devices.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span>GICDevice<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the GIC version of the device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>version</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>u32</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the file descriptor of the GIC device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_fd</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>DeviceFd</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns an array with GIC device properties
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_properties</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u64</span>];<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, we can define objects per GIC version, which implement this
Trait, and still have the rest of the code deal with the <code>GICDevice</code> Trait,
which is transparent to the GIC version.</p>

<p>The implementations for each version, implement the Trait and a <code>new</code> function
which is used to create the new object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>VmFd</span>,<span> </span>vcpu_count: <span>u64</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>GICDevice<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The differentiation between the two versions lays in the VGIC register
attributes that each device exposes. As a result, the work we need to do is essentially to <code>mmap</code> their addresses.</p>

<p>GICv2 relevant addresses include the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>cpu</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.
</span><span> We are placing the GIC below 1GB so we need to substract the size of the distributor.

<p>Regarding the FDT creation, there are differences between v2 and v3 regarding
the interrupt controller <code>intc</code> node.</p>

<p>First, we need to define the GICv2 <code>compatible</code> property to be <code>arm,gic-400</code>,
since it is the GIC-400 chip which implements GICv2. Next is the <code>reg</code>
property of the FDT, which includes the addresses and the corresponding sizes of
the GIC registers, i.e. distributor and CPU for GICv2, distributor and
redistributor for GICv3. Finally, we fix the <code>interrupts</code> property which
determines the interrupt source of the VGIC maintenance interrupt. The
corresponding values for GICv2 were taken from the respective <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm%2Cgic.yaml">Linux Kernel entries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="build-firecracker-with-rpi4-support">Build firecracker with RPi4 support</h4>

<p>While waiting for the patch to merge upstream you can go ahead and check out it
yourself.</p>

<p>Clone and build our fork of firecracker (keep in mind that while the PR review
is going on, we might force-update the branch).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker.git
$ <span>cd</span> firecracker
$ ./tools/devtool build</code></pre></div>
<p>Next you need a kernel image and a root filesystem to run with your firecracker
build. You can grab the pre-built kernel image and rootfs here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4 </code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own kernel and rootfs using the following
steps provided by the firecracker docs
<a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md">here</a></p>

<h4 id="launch-our-image">Launch our image</h4>

<p>To launch our image we will use the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl">firectl</a> tool. We need, to setup a tap
device for the networking or our firecracker microVM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add <span>172</span>.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up</code></pre></div>
<p>And we launch the microVM using firectl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">firectl --firecracker-binary<span>=</span><span>${</span><span>PATH_TO_FC_BIN</span><span>}</span> --kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\
</span><span></span>	--tap-device<span>=</span>tap0/aa:fc:00:00:00:01 <span>\
</span><span></span>	--kernel-opts<span>=</span><span>"console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off ip=172.16.0.42::172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>	--root-drive<span>=</span>./nginx_fc.ext4</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we used here the <code>ip</code> kernel boot parameter to give the <code>172.16.0.42</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we try out our nginx server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">curl 172.16.0.42
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;

        <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span> <span>auto</span>;
        <span>font-family</span>: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, <span>sans-serif</span>;
    }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>

  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

                        <p>The use of serverless computing has become a must nowadays, and some of you may already know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services like <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/">Lambda Functions</a>, Step Functions, and other services AWS provides. However, if this is the first time you hear about them – fantastic!</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss AWS Step Functions, what they are used for, how to use them, and the advantages or disadvantages that they bring.</p>
<h2><span><b>AWS Step Functions 101</b></span></h2>
<p>Before we can jump into Step Functions, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic structure behind them. Step Functions are an AWS-managed service that uses <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/well-architected/finite-state-machine/">Finite-State Machine (FSM)</a> model.</p>
<p><em>Why is that important?</em></p>
<p>By coordinating multiple AWS services into different serverless workflows, you can quickly build and update the apps. Additionally, with Step Functions, you’ll be able to both design and run workflows that’ll bring together various services, including Amazon ECS and AWS Lambda, into feature-rich applications.</p>
<h2><b>FSM Model Explained</b></h2>
<p>The two keywords you need to remember are States and Transitions.</p>
<p><em>Now, why are these words so important?</em></p>
<p>FSM model does a simple job – it uses given states and transitions to complete the tasks at hand. Finite-State Machines are also known as a behavioral model. It’s an abstract machine (system) that can be in 1 (one) state at a time, but it can also switch between a finite number of states.</p>
<p>This machine is defined solely by its states and the relationship these states have between themselves. A good and very straightforward example is the “closed-door example.” The door can either be open or closed, and these are the only two possible states. Now, the transition part is the switch between two states, but you need to provide some input first to get there. When you close the door, you’re placing an input. Additionally, the sequence of opening the closed door is known as the switch between two states (transition).</p>
<figure id="attachment_2958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2958"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png" alt="StepFunctions state input and transition" width="640" height="391" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-300x183.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-768x469.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2958"><em>StepFunctions state input and transition</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also apply the same thing to other examples, like your daily life routines. Let’s take “Work, home, bed” as states. From work (state), you take a bus (input) to get home (state), and when you arrive home, you go to bed (another input leading to another state). Tomorrow morning when you wake up and get out of your bed, you’re transitioning from the last state you were in into a previous one, and yet again, taking the bus from home to work is one more transition.</p>
<p>There are other, more complex examples with many more states, inputs, and transitions between them, and the more states you add, the more complex the FSM model becomes.</p>
<p>The conclusion is simple – FSMs are a method of modeling your system by defining the states and transitions between those states.</p>
<h2><span><b>What Are Step Functions?</b></span></h2>
<p>Step Functions are Amazon’s Finite-State Machines service that’s entirely managed while also being serverless. Step Functions are made of state machines (workflows) and tasks. Tasks are individual states or single units of work.</p>
<p>In the following graph, you’ll see an example of Amazon’s State Machine in which the green rectangles represent the states. The result leads to another state, which then leads to the choice that depends on the given input (email or SMS). In this example, the green states were successfully executed, while the white-colored state wasn’t.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2959"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png" alt="Amazon's state machine" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-300x250.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-768x640.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2959"><em>Amazon’s state machine</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>This entire graph representing the state machine is also known as a Workflow, and there are two types of workflows available.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Workflow</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Types Of Workflows</b></h3>
<p>Workflows are divided into two groups: Standard and Express workflow. Unlike Standard, the Express workflow is a relatively new option that has been available since last year. The table below shows the differences between these two workflow types.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Workflows</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Standard</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Express</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>

</td>
<td>

</td>

<tr>

</td>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><b>State Transitions</b></p>
</td>

<p>4000+</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Unlimited</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Price</b></p>
</td>

</td>
<td>
<p>Number of executions, duration &amp; memory</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Exactly once</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>At least once</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution History</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>API, AWS Console or CloudWatch</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>CloudWatch</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>State machines orchestrate the work of Lambda functions. When one function ends, it triggers another function to begin. Although Max Duration is significantly different, Express workflow allows more scalability. Moreover, Express workflow pricing is constructed with more details since users will have to pay for the number of executions, including the duration and memory used for those executions. Standard workflow pricing requires users to pay only for each state transition that occurs.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Standard workflow is a long-running workflow that has to be durable and auditable. In contrast, the Express workflow type is needed for a much higher workflow and event processing volume.</p>
<h3><b>Workflow Execution</b></h3>
<p>Now that you know the basics, the next step of the way is the execution. To trigger the workflow to start the execution against Step Function API, you can use CloudWatch events as a time trigger or use API Gateway as a proxy.</p>
<h3><span><b>State Types</b></span></h3>
<p>It’s essential to remember that States aren’t the same thing as Tasks since Tasks are one of the State types. There are numerous State types, and all of them have a role to play in the overall workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass: Pushes input to output.</li>
<li>Task: Takes input and produces output.</li>
<li>Choice: Allows the user to use Branching Logic that’s based on the input.</li>
<li>Wait: It adds delays to State Machine execution.</li>
<li>Success: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution successfully.</li>
<li>Fail: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution with a failure.</li>
<li>Parallel: Allows a user to implement parallel branches in execution, meaning the user can start multiple states at once.</li>
<li>(Dynamic) Mapping: Runs a set of steps for every input item.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span><b>Tasks</b></span></h3>
<p>Tasks are the leading States in which all the work is done. Tasks can call Activities (remote executions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Call an execution on either ECS, EC2 machines, or mobile devices.</li>
<li>Sending SMS notifications and wait for the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another constructive element that Step Functions Tasks provide is that it allows you to reach out from your AWS space.</p>
<h3><span><b>Error Handling</b></span></h3>
<p>Error handling includes retries and catch. An excellent example of how does Step Functions work is shown in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png" alt="Step Function visual workflow" width="640" height="551" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-300x258.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-768x661.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2960"><em>Step Function visual workflow</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In this example, you can see the Parallel branching task. This task is a perfect example representing how the entire execution will fail if only one state encounters an error.</p>
<p>Users are provided with Amazon State Language that helps them catch those errors and define all the retries. All this is extremely important for business-critical operations.</p>
<p>Amazon State Language allows you to place a comment, define when the state should start, and define the states and tasks. Moreover, suppose a customer handled an error. In that case, this tool allows you to specify the retries based on the error name, but also to specify the retry interval, as well as the number of retry maximum attempts, and backoff rate, which you can see in the example below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2961"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Error handling example" width="640" height="279" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-1024x446.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22-768x334.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.23.22.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2961"><em>Amazon State Language: Error handling example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In case you wish to catch errors, you’ll see why some states weren’t executed and which tasks have failed. See an example of how to catch an error in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2962"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png" alt="Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example" width="640" height="280" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-1024x448.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-300x131.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06-768x336.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.28.06.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2962"><em>Amazon State Language: Catch Errors example</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The first retry attempt will start at the pre-determined interval, and it gets multiplied by the backoff rate you’ve set.</p>
<p>Error handling is critical because if Parallel tasks execute successfully, but one fails, the entire execution will fail. However, even if the entire execution fails, the state changes will remain intact.</p>
<p>Error handling allows you to track everything that’s happened in the log, and by doing so, you’ll have a better insight on why some errors happened so you could handle the core problem.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Demonstration</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Choice Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>You’ll have to input a preferred number into your function. For example, if you chose a number 10 and a customer buys more than ten items from you, the Step Function will execute successfully by following a preferred choice. In case a customer buys less than ten items, the execution will also be successful, but under a different pre-set choice.</p>
<h3><b>Retry Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>It’s required that you specify the number of retries for all errors and define the interval, along with the number of maximum attempts. There you’ll see that it’s retrying to execute the function until it finally fails.</p>
<p>When the execution fails, you can check the logs in the Execution Event History tab to see how many times it started, but you’ll also be able to see the retries in between each start. You can access detailed information by following the CloudWatch logs link within the Event History tab.</p>
<h3><b>Catch Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>Input a specific number range, and the function will execute based on the pre-set number. If the execution number goes outside the pre-set number range, the function will report a Range Error. However, if the number goes below the minimal pre-set number higher than zero, the function will report a Custom Error.</p>

It provides much better error handling logic that Lambda Functions, while it’s relatively easy to orchestrate them.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Apple computers ship with a custom operating system - macOS, which has a few annoying features.
Among the annoyances a special place has to be reserved for the inability to remove or rename the folders located in <code>$HOME</code>.
Here I describe my way of dealing with this problem.</p>

<h2 id="hidingdefaultfolders">Hiding default folders</h2>

<p>On the web countless macOS users are looking for answers to the same question: “How can I get rid of ‘Desktop’, ‘Documents’, ‘Downloads’, ‘Library’, ‘Movies’, ‘Music’, ‘Pictures’, and ‘Public’ folders?”
Multiple suggestions are provided as possible solutions.
You can: replace the folders with files<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; hide the folders from ‘Finder’ and make them inaccessible<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; or simply learn to live with them, as the system will recreate those folders by itself anyway<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>I decided to hide.
But, when working in the command line, hiding these folders from Finder is not enough.
Below are three settings that, while not covering all corner cases, go a long way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>hide from <code>Finder</code> by adding a hidden flag</p>

<pre><code>chflags hidden ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads ~/Library
chflags hidden ~/Movies ~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from <code>ls</code> by creating an alias in <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>alias ls='ls -I Desktop -I Documents -I Downloads -I Library\
             -I Movies -I Music -I Pictures -I Public'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from tab completion by setting a special bash <code>FIGNORE</code><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable.</p>

<pre><code>export FIGNORE=Desktop:Documents:Downloads:Library:Movies:Music:Pictures:Public
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That is it, the folders should mostly be out of view.
And if for whatever reason we need to temporary see them again a simple <code>\ls</code> would bypass the alias and provide us the full list.</p>

<h2 id="creatinganewhierarchy">Creating a new hierarchy</h2>

<p>With the folders out of view we can now move onto creating our own home hierarchy.
This part mostly depends on the needs of the user.
But I would like to offer one piece of advice: make sure your folders start with unique lowercase letters.
This will allow you to auto-complete folder names after typing a single character and offer extra protection against invoking a command on one of those default hidden folders, that start with upper case letters.</p>

<p>In my case the new hierarchy looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>├── base
│   ├─── bin
│   ├─── etc
│   ├─── src
│   └─── var
│
├── desk
│
├── file
│   ├─── articles
│   ├─── books
│   ├─── documents
│   ├─── essays
│   ├─── photos
│   └─── videos
│
└── work
    ├─── active_project_one
    ├─── active_project_two
    └─── zzz
         ├─── inactive_project_one
         ├─── inactive_project_two
         ├─── inactive_project_three
         ├─── inactive_project_four
         └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>'base'</code> is a substitute for <code>'.local'</code>.<br>
<code>'desk'</code> takes the place of the <code>'Desktop'</code> and <code>'Downloads'</code>.<br>
<code>'file'</code> is an aggregate of <code>'Documents'</code>, <code>'Music'</code>, <code>'Pictures'</code>, and <code>'Movies'</code>.<br>
<code>'work'</code> stores various active and completed projects.</p>

<h2 id="linkingdownloadsanddesktop">Linking Downloads and Desktop</h2>

<p>There is one detail remaining: macOS has a useful <code>'Desktop'</code> and now its hidden from us.
On top of that some third party applications put various acquired data into the <code>'Downloads'</code> folder.
Hence, we want to see the contents of those folders within our new file hierarchy.
We achieve this with symbolic links.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make <code>'Desktop'</code> be a symbolic link for our new folder <code>'desk'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Desktop
ln -s desk Desktop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>make <code>'Downloads'</code> be a symbolic link for <code>'Desktop'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Downloads
ln -s Desktop Downloads
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>And now whenever a file is put into the, now hidden, <code>'Downloads'</code> or <code>'Desktop'</code> folders, it will be placed in our <code>'desk'</code> instead.
Moreover, since <code>'Desktop'</code> is a link to <code>'desk'</code>, whatever is put into the <code>'desk'</code> directory will be visible on the actual desktop on a screen.</p>

<h2 id="theresult">The result</h2>

<pre><code>$ ls ~/
base desk file work

$ cd ~/D&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/D

$ cd ~/d&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/desk
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Getting rid of default macOS home directories is hard.
Hiding, instead of trying to delete, seems like an easier and safer solution.
The tricks presented in this article, while not being 100% effective, go along way.
I’ve been using this approach for a few years without accidentally seeing any reminder of those folders during this whole time.</p>

        <p><em>Patrick Stevens is a Developer at G-Research.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: <em>If you aren’t using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or one of its siblings to remember what you learn, you are missing out on literal superpowers. There are specific techniques which I’ve found helpful for using it to learn maths and computer science in particular.</em></p>
<p>This post will discuss extremely briefly what Anki is, but is mainly aimed at helping the student of maths or computer science to squeeze out some extra droplets of productivity from it. If you aren’t already familiar with Anki, go and read Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> as well or instead of this one; if you’re short of time, the main value of the post to someone new to Anki is in the first one-eighth or so, up to but not including “Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an unfamiliar field”. That essay gives a broad-strokes motivation for why one might want to use Anki at all. (Spoiler: it gives you a superhuman memory!)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-anki-">What is Anki?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>: essentially a program that shows you flashcards at intervals tailored to help you remember their contents. Such systems are based on the observation that while you can’t stop memories from decaying, repeated exposure makes the decay exponentially slower.</p>
<p>So while you need to rehearse a fact frequently when you first come to learn it, reviews can become very sparse very quickly without losing much of your hard-won memory.</p>
<p>Anki is only one such system; other implementations such as SuperMemo and Mnemosyne exist.<br>
There are also applications using the same principles for more specific goals; for example, Memrise is designed for language learning. This post is phrased in terms of Anki, because for historical reasons that’s the one I use.</p>

<p>I’ve placed this section at the start, because I believe that spaced repetition is genuinely a superpower that anyone can acquire. If I can’t hold your interest in this post, I encourage you to glance over these other resources in the hope that one of them does the trick!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> –&nbsp; a brief introduction to various memory systems with a particular focus on Anki. The money quote: “Anki makes memory a choice”. If you choose to remember something, you can.</li>
<li><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a> – an introduction to quantum computation with integrated spaced-repetition flashcards, which comes with emailed reminders to use the site at intervals. Even if you have no interest in quantum computation, I recommend skimming at least the first bits of the site, so that you can see what really good flashcards based on a text can look like. (Note that some of its cards are not ideal; the site does sometimes fall into the “yes/no” pattern, with flashcards whose answer is a bald “yes” or “no”. Cards of this form aren’t as good as cards which get you to reproduce actually content-based parts of a fact.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">The Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge in Learning</a> – the creator of the spaced-repetition system SuperMemo discusses how to formulate knowledge so that it sticks. Again, even if you don’t use spaced repetition, definitely read this; the advice is absolutely foundational to my understanding of how to learn. A nontrivial amount of this very blog post is essentially specialising some of these rules to the case of maths and computer science.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">Reddit: Medical School Anki</a>, a subreddit with almost 55,000 subscribers at the time of writing. This link is here just to demonstrate that there are fields (such as medicine) in which Anki is very popular and nowhere near as niche as it is in most areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely crucial to the effective use of Anki for even a moderate collection of cards is that answering a card should be a single mental motion.</p>
<p>What does this mean? We’ll demonstrate with some positive and negative examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is the capital of France?” is probably answered with a single mental motion: it’s just “Paris”, obtained by a simple lookup in your memory.</li>
<li>“What is 367 times 399?” is many mental motions unless you are really unusually good at mental arithmetic. Almost everyone has to carry out some algorithm to get an answer to this question.</li>
<li>“What is the composition of air?” is probably many mental motions: for example, a lookup of “which gases are in air?” and a number of motions like “what proportion of air is this specific gas?”. Or it could be the various mental motions of “Which gas is the nth most common in air, and what is its proportion in air?” as n varies.</li>
<li>“What is the most common gas in air, and what is its proportion?” is very possibly a single mental motion despite the multiple components in its answer. For me, the knowledge that “nitrogen is the most common gas in air” is intimately bound up with “78% of air is nitrogen”; to answer one question is to access the same mental lump of storage as is required to answer the other question. Of course, for someone else, this may be two distinct facts and two distinct memory lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A card that is answered with one mental motion may be multiple motions for someone else; and a question answered with many mental motions may become one motion after you learn some additional fact or part of the model that ties the facts together. So it’s helpful if you personally keep track of what you’re doing to answer a given card, so that you can recognise some of this structure in your own mind.</p>
<p>Any card which is multiple mental motions should be broken down into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>If you’re doing too much work to answer a card, it’s important to notice, so that you can break the card down. And don’t worry that you might “break down a card too much”; if the cards are easy, Anki will exponentially decrease how often it shows them to you. The cost of creating a card that’s too easy is almost entirely in the time it takes you to create the card in the first place; a card that’s too difficult will sap your time and energy again and again.</p>

<p>As an example, recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test for convergence</a>, likely to be covered in any first course in analysis:</p>
<p><em>Let$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ be a complex series, with each $a_i$ nonzero.<br>
Suppose that there is $a$ such that $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to a$.<br>
Then, if $a &lt; 1$ then the series converges absolutely; if $a &gt; 1$ then the series diverges.</em></p>
<p>(We’ll discuss its proof in a later section.)</p>
<p>This statement has a number of moving parts, and is definitely much too large to appear as a single card. (Remember the rule of thumb: answering a single card should be a single mental motion.)<br>
How could we formulate this statement in an Anki-friendly way?</p>
<p>My own personal Anki collection contains the following cards. (Anki does allow LaTeX, though I often optimise for speed of card creation and just use plain text, however ugly it ends up. As long as it’s easily legible, it doesn’t need to be pretty.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions exist on the ratio test? (answer: nonzero, sequence of ratios has a limit)</li>
<li>When does the ratio test let us conclude something? (answer: successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1)</li>
<li>Which cases exist on the ratio test? (answer: ratios converge to less than, or greater than, 1)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something less than 1? (answer: converges absolutely)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something greater than 1? (answer: diverges)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to 1? (answer: nothing)</li>
<li>Give an example where the ratio test is inconclusive. (answer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">harmonic series</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cards are very simple; perhaps they might look laughably simple. This is fine! Remember that Anki will rapidly stop showing you cards you already know. Crucially each card is really a single mental motion to answer.</p>
<p>Note also that information is duplicated between cards. For example, there are two cards saying in slightly different ways that the ratio test talks about when successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1. Again, it’s fine to repeat information, because cards are cheap. Here, the information is duplicated to better facilitate the links between the cards: one card is a general “when can we conclude anything”, and one card is the same information rephrased as “which cases do I need to consider to produce more information here”. Without the additional rephrasing, there’s more of a risk of developing “isolated” clusters of cards; the aim is that given just the prompt “ratio test”, I can reproduce the <em>entire</em> cluster without thinking any further.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to store key examples and counterexamples!</p>

<p>Remembering a definition is rather like remembering the statement of a theorem.<br>
Without further ado, here is my definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, imprecisely, are the colouring rules on a red-black tree? (“global; local; base-case”)</li>
<li>What are the leaves of a red-black tree? (“null, black”)</li>
<li>What is the base-case colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“leaves are black”)</li>
<li>What is the local colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“red node =&gt; black children”)</li>
<li>What is the global colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“black depth is well defined”)</li>
<li>What is the black depth of a node in a red-black tree? (“the number of black nodes encountered on a path from that node down to a leaf”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there is some duplication (two cards note that the leaves of a red-black tree are coloured black), and all the cards are extremely simple. The point is to make sure not only that the actual <em>content</em> is remembered, but also that the content is interlinked enough that you can reproduce the entire definition from the single prompt “red-black tree”. Moreover, one card is explicitly structural and carries no actual content as such: the card that lists the three types of colouring rule. This card is there solely to allow me to remember which <em>cards</em> are relevant.</p>
<p>Naively, one might create instead a single card, “what is a red-black tree?”. But in my experience, this is too big. If you’re reviewing even 30 cards a day, and …</p></div></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html">archive.org</a>

<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

            <div><p>Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd &amp; containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can run <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> anywhere, even on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas">OpenFaaS</a>, but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF project</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png" alt="OpenFaaS and containerd logos"></p>
<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

They should be on your Freebie List too.</h2></div></div><div><div><h3>DoNotPay</h3><p>The DoNotPay app is the home of the world's first robot lawyer.

Team is known to have an unheard of product-shipping cadence, delivering new (great) products to users consistently.<br>• You enjoy high momentum &amp; impact.

              News information is important for many different use cases from brand monitoring to trend discovery to financial news monitoring. Many companies rely on news monitoring to find new opportunities in the markets, including new clients.
            </p>

              The most popular use cases include:

            <p>
              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
              Let’s go over the main features and make a side-by-side comparison with Google News.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Maximum number of articles returned per query.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has a max limit of <span>100</span> articles per query without any possibility to retrieve more. This may be a big limitation if the search keyword is very popular and may contain thousands or even tens of thousands of relevant articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In contrast, Datanews News API provides access to <span>all of the relevant articles whenever they were published</span>. The API uses
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a> for efficient transfer of a large amount of articles through the network.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Available news article metadata.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic staff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>

<div><p>A few people have asked recently what exactly is going on inside the PN junction. What concretely is happening? How can we leverage students’ previous knowledge about current and charge?</p><p>I made these videos because I wasn’t satisfied with the textbook or the available resources. No math; just a heuristic blow-by-blow focusing on electrons, physical force, and causality. The production value ranges from amateur to terrible.
