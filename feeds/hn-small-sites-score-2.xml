<p>This is my 50th post published on this blog. To celebrate, I’ll go all meta and describe the ins and outs of my <em>“blogger’s career”</em>. Read on if you ever wanted to start writing but never got around to actually hitting the publish button. This post aims to encourage you that blogging can be loads of fun and open up a whole range of opportunities for your career.</p>
<h3 id="your-best-online-portfolio">Your best online portfolio</h3>
<p>I’ve started blogging when I failed to score the <em>“dream”</em> job. I’ve decided to increase my future chances by appearing more professional as an author of a technical blog. My first posts were answers to questions that kept popping up during interviews.</p>
<p>I know that some companies, e.g., software houses, forbid their employees to share details about clients that they’ve worked for. It means that after spending a couple of years in the software house, you could have not much to show to score a better job. A collection of technical blog posts could be your ticket to a more senior/lead/principal position.</p>
<h3 id="the-value-of-being-wrong-on-the-internet">The value of being wrong on the internet</h3>
<p>Working on a blog post allows you to investigate different technical topics deeper than you would otherwise. There’s no better way to learn something than to try to explain it to random strangers from the internet. I often setup throwaway projects, submit open-source PRs, and read up on eBooks when doing the research for my posts.</p>
<p>I send most of my posts for proofreading to friends before publication. They usually catch most of the errors, but it’s not a tragedy even if they don’t.</p>
<p>If you publish a technical post and someone points out your error, you’ve just learned something new. I regularly improve my posts based on comments from social platforms. For me, especially <a href="https://reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lobsters</a> are a great source of valuable comments. By publishing online, you can easily trigger internet experts to share their wisdom with you.</p>
<h3 id="build-it-on-your-own-ground">Build it on your own ground</h3>
<p>I think it’s critical to publish your content on the platform that you own. For the first one or two posts, you could use something like Medium. Once you decide you enjoy the process of blogging, then migrating to your custom domain and server is the only reasonable choice.</p>
<p>I’d recommend registering a domain that’s somewhat related to your real name. Fancy brands and pseudonyms come and go, and we’re talking a long game here.</p>
<p>Just please, please don’t stay on Medium! It’s terrible for your personal brand and SEO. Regularly publishing there is a wasted effort. Check out <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/medium-blogging-platform-seo">this blog post</a> for more info about why.</p>
<p>There are many cases of arbitrary censorship on social media nowadays. If you publish on a platform that you don’t control, you risk losing the results of your hard work for whatever strange reason. It’s significantly less probable to lose your domain, but you still could get banned by Google and lose all organic traffic.</p>
<p>The only resource that no IT giant could take away from you is a mailing list. Unfortunately, I’m not an expert on building one. I’ve only managed to gather a couple of hundred subscribers in over three years.</p>
<h3 id="jump-start-any-new-project">Jump-start any new project</h3>
<p>I quit my full-time job half a year ago. I’ve since been paying my bills from the sponsorship of this blog and profit from <a href="https://abot.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abot for Slack</a>. Having those two sources of base <em>“passive”</em> income allowed me to take a step towards working as a consultant instead of a developer. Check out this <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/hbin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent book by Jonathan Start</a> for more info about the difference between the two.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that if it wasn’t for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16616991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>viralish</em> blog post</a> my Slack bot would have never taken off. Based on the comments it received, I’ve refined the app’s features and business model to a much more profitable format.</p>
<p>Currently, the primary commercial purpose of this blog is to serve as a content-marketing platform to advertise my <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/#rails-performance-tuning">Rails performance and security audits</a>. It has been slowly picking up speed, and if this keeps up, I might not have to come back to working 9 to 5 anytime soon. Currently, my Rails audit adverts on this blog receive clicks every single day. I’d have to spend significant $$$ on Google Ads to generate similar paid traffic.</p>
<p>This domain also allows me to keep the SEO gods happy by backlinking to my other projects and passing some of its authority.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that a domain getting steady organic visitors is an invaluable resource. It allows you to pour traffic towards any future project that you might come up with. When you start writing, you won’t know the ultimate purpose of your blog. The possibilities are kind of endless.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Gradually growing your own place on the internet could be the single best investment in your future career. Just do it a single step at a time. When I published my first post three years ago, I never thought blogging would become a significant part of my everyday work and income. Or that I’d ever reach 50th blog post and keep going.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The notion of programming paradigms, with associated programming languages and methodologies, is a well established tenet of Computer Science pedagogy, enshrined in international curricula. However,this notion sits ill with Kuhn’s classic conceptualisation of a scientific paradigm as a dominant world view, which supersedes its predecessors through superior explanatory power.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is not at all clear how programming paradigms are to be characterised and differentiated. Indeed, on closer inspection, apparently disparate programming paradigms are very strongly connected. Rather, they should be viewed as different traditions of a unitary Computer Science paradigm of Turing complete computation complemented by Computational Thinking.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast recompilation.</p>

<p>Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration, correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.</p>

<p>Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental com- piler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original compiler and has a solution to com- pile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler.</p>

<p>Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation à la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking into the compiler.</p>

<p>Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual machine image for easy reproducibility.</p>

<p>Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>Welcome back guys, in this module, we are going to discuss the Future of Python, i.e., how python is booming todayâ€™s industry, and how the same or more industries can be impacted by python. So, letâ€™s dive into the depth of this amazing module.</p>
<h2>Future of Python</h2>
<p>Since Python has become the most used modern programming language in todayâ€™s arena. It has been dominated in all other programming languages like <a href="https://usemynotes.com/c-programming/">C</a>, C++, <a href="https://usemynotes.com/java-programming/">Java</a>, and many more. Since, the day it comes into role i.e., the early nineties, from that very day till now, it has made its growth continuously. So, what is making python more popular, is it going to be in the same trend in the future also.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s focus on some of the key points about the popularity of python.</p>
<h3>Beginners Friendly</h3>
<p>Python is a very easy language; it can easily be chosen as the first language by each and every person who wants to land in the programming world.</p>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>The most important part of python is that it is open-source, i.e., freely available on the internet and anyone from anywhere in the world can use that code and make changes or modify that accordingly as per the requirement.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>Python is a very versatile language, i.e., in almost everything we can work with python, developers, and making or developing many packages for everything, like it is mostly used in data science, web development, and many more. Some of the frequently used libraries are NumPy for working with numerical i.e., numbers, pandas for working with data sets, scikit-learn for working with various machine learning algorithms.</p>
<h3>Cross-Platform language</h3>
<p>The best part of python is that it can be easily used with any type of operating system whether it be Windows, Linux or Mac, etc. This means that you donâ€™t have to use different code for working with the different operating system, the code written in windows can be used in the Linux platforms also. In simple words, python doesnâ€™t need the support of our system.</p>
<h3>Speed and Productivity</h3>
<p>The ability of python, the way it controls the process, the integration of various processes, its various framework, these all things or we can say all these capabilities of python lead to increase its speed and productivity. Multi-protocol network applications, most applications can be built by using python.</p>
<h3>Pseudocode</h3>

<p>It is a very simple language, which comes with very advanced features that can easily overcome all the common programming tasks.</p>
<h3>Strong and rich community</h3>
<p>There are many programmers who are working in python only and coming up with various solutions for a variety of problems and this creates a strong community of smart developers.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of Python?</h2>
<p>Since, we know why <a href="https://usemynotes.com/python/">python</a> is popular, so in the same way because of its popularity and features it is giving an advantage to a lot of companies using python, Letâ€™s see some of the benefits of using python.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Website Building</h3>
<p>Python can be used for creating websites as per your requirement very easily.</p>
<h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
<p>Many Apps are being created with the help of python only nowadays and are deployed in the play store.</p>
<h3>GUI-based Application</h3>
<p>Many responsive GUI applications are created with the help of python by using the <strong>Tkinter library.</strong></p>
<h3>Data Science</h3>
<p>The most important field in which python is booming the developers and creating a lot of competition in the market. Python is widely used for data analysis, data visualization, data exploration. As we know, there is a huge amount of data is generated every single day by almost all the companies, and so to handle that data, python is used.</p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Python is used to build a Machine Learning model, which is used for making predictions. Healthcare, e-commerce, tech companies, almost all sectors are using the machine learning technique.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the benefits of python that why python is widely used, this is what python is in the current scenario, and also because of its amazing features and characteristics, it will continue to boom in the future also.</p>
<p>There are many programming languages, and python is on top of all that, it is usually the favorite language of all the programmers among all other available languages. Python is developing at a huge rate and is able to develop many of the applications which have been used in real-time, and the most important thing is <strong>Machine learning</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong> and taking up the IT sector and working with these, python is used. So, we can easily assume that Python is even coming in the future decade, The only thing it can do, it can expand, i.e., maybe get involved with AI development.</p>
<p>I hope this module was very exciting, and you all must think to start learning or building your career in python. So, you are all in the right place, stay connected with us, for such more modules. Until then, Stay healthy, keep learning!</p>

            Everyone Is Beautiful and No One Is Horny    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Modern action and superhero films fetishize the body, even as they desexualize it.</strong></h4>



<p><strong>by RS Benedict</strong></p>



<p>When Paul Verhoeven adapted <em>Starship Troopers</em> in the late 1990s, did he know he was predicting the future? The endless desert war, the ubiquity of military propaganda, a cheerful face shouting victory as more and more bodies pile up?</p>



<p>But the scene that left perhaps the greatest impact on the minds of Nineties kids—and the scene that anticipated our current cinematic age the best—does not feature bugs or guns. It is, of course, the shower scene, in which our heroic servicemen and -women enjoy a communal grooming ritual.</p>



<p>On the surface, it is idyllic: racial harmony, gender equality, unity behind a common goal—and firm, perky asses and tits.</p>



<p>And then the characters speak. The topic of conversation? Military service, of course. One joined for the sake of her political career. Another joined in the hopes of receiving her breeding license. Another talks about how badly he wants to kill the enemy. No one looks at each other. No one flirts.</p>



<p>A room full of beautiful, bare bodies, and everyone is only horny for war.</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, there was a brief period where actresses pretended that their thinness was natural, almost accidental. Skinny celebrities confessed their love of burgers and fries in magazines; models undergoing profile interviews engaged in public consumption of pasta; leading ladies joked about how little they exercised and how much they hated it. It was all bullshit: no one looks like that without calorie restriction. We knew it then, and we know it now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t pretend anymore. The promotional cycles for blockbuster movies now include detailed descriptions of the performers’ fitness regimens. We watch actors doing burpees or shaking ropes with expensive personal trainers. There is some talk of diets, though not terribly detailed—and no mention of steroids or other hormonal supplements, even though male actors’ suddenly ultra-swole selfies on Instagram suggest physiques crafted with chemical assistance.</p>



<p>Actors are more physically perfect than ever: impossibly lean, shockingly muscular, with magnificently coiffed hair, high cheekbones, impeccable surgical enhancements, and flawless skin, all displayed in form-fitting superhero costumes with the obligatory shirtless scene thrown in to show off shredded abs and rippling pecs.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Even background extras are good-looking, or at least inoffensively bland. No one is ugly. No one is really fat. Everyone is beautiful.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And this isn’t just the lead and the love interest: supporting characters look this way too, and even villains (frequently clad in monstrous makeup) are still played by conventionally attractive performers. Even background extras are good-looking, or at least inoffensively bland. No one is ugly. No one is really fat. Everyone is beautiful.</p>



<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/marvel-movies-this-esteemed-director-says-theyre-not-sexy-enough.html/"><strong>no one is horny</strong></a>. Even when they have sex, no one is horny. No one is attracted to anyone else. No one is hungry for anyone else.</p>



<p>When revisiting a beloved Eighties or Nineties film, Millennial and Gen X viewers are often startled to encounter long-forgotten sexual content content: John Connor’s conception in <em>Terminator</em>, Jamie Lee Curtis’s toplessness in <em>Trading Places</em>, the spectral blowjob in <em>Ghostbusters</em>. These scenes didn’t shock us when we first saw them. Of <em>course </em>there’s sex in a movie. Isn’t there always?</p>



<p>The answer, of course, is not anymore—at least not when it comes to modern blockbusters</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="319" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-300x188.jpg 300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px"></figure></div>



<p>We’re told that Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are an item, but no actual romantic or sexual chemistry between them is shown in the films. Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor utterly lack the sexual chemistry to convince us that either of them would be thirsty enough to commandeer a coma victim’s body (as they do in <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>) so they can enjoy a posthumous hookup. In defiance of Norse mythology, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor<em> </em>smiles at Natalie Portman like a dumb golden retriever puppy without ever venturing to rend her asunder with his mighty hammer, so to speak. Not that the competition is any better. Despite accusations of being an incel icon, it is Heath Ledger’s Joker, not Christian Bale’s chaste and sexless Batman, who exudes the most sexual energy in the Dark Knight trilogy.</p>



<p>And speaking of Christopher Nolan’s inexplicably sexless oeuvre—did anyone else think it odd how <em>Inception </em>enters the deepest level of a rich man’s subconscious and finds <em>not </em>a psychosexual Oedipal nightmare of staggering depravity, but… a ski patrol?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Let’s not pretend that Old Hollywood was a progressive haven of body positivity. Since the departure of voluptuous vamp Theda Bara from the silver screen, actors have always gone to extremes to maintain a certain look. Rita Hayworth underwent an ethnic makeover to appear more Caucasian so she could get leading roles. Stars of the 1920s limited their fluid consumption to two glasses a day to avoid water weight. Jane Fonda suffered from severe bulimia at the height of her sex symbol status; so did Marlon Brando.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Snake Plissken didn’t fuck on screen, but the character radiates overwhelming sex-haver energy.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But old films still featured recognizable human bodies and human faces—bodies that could theoretically be achieved by a single person without the aid of a team of personal trainers, dieticians, private chefs, and chemists.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="252" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1300x650.jpg 1300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px"></figure></div>



<p>In the films of the Eighties and Nineties, leading actors were good looking, yes, but still human. Kurt Russel’s Snake Plissken was a hunk, but in shirtless scenes his abs have no definition. Bruce Willis was handsome, but he’s more muscular now than he was in the Nineties, when he was routinely branded a bona fide sex symbol. And when Isabella Rosselini strips in <em>Blue Velvet</em>, her skin is pale and her body is soft. She looks vulnerable and real.</p>



<p>And yet, these characters fucked. <em>Blue Velvet’s </em>Dorothy Vallens and Jeffrey Beaumant fucked. Michael Keaton’s Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer’s domme Catwoman fucked. Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fucked. Snake Plissken didn’t fuck on screen, but the character radiates overwhelming sex-haver energy. And I defy you to find a mainstream film with a moment as horny and gay as the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-true-story-of-the-lost-boys-sax-man-1842774832"><strong>Sexy Saxophone Solo</strong></a> from <em>The Lost Boys</em>.</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Seen today, one of the most striking scenes in 1982’s Poltergeist is not the evil clown doll or the monster tree, but a moment of relaxed affection between the parents. The father—a bald, beer-bellied Craig T. Nelson—cracks jokes and prances for his wife, who wears a frumpy nightgown and smokes a joint and yammers weed thoughts and laughs at her husband’s silly display. Finally, the husband playfully dives onto the bed. Neither character is glamorous in this scene, but their relationship feels frisky and lived-in and charismatic and <em>real</em>.</p>



<p>The house looks real, too. There are toys and magazines scattered around the floor. There are cardboard boxes waiting to be unpacked since the recent move. Framed pictures rest against the wall; the parents haven’t gotten around to mounting them yet. The kitchen counters are cluttered and mealtimes are rambunctious and sloppy, as one expects in a house with three children. They’re building a pool in the backyard, but not for appearances: it’s a place for the kids to swim, for the parents to throw parties, and for the father to reacquaint himself with his love of diving.</p>



<p>At the time, this house represented an aspirational ideal of American affluence.</p>



<p>Compare this to homes in films now: massive, sterile cavernous spaces with minimalist furniture. Kitchens are industrial-sized and spotless, and they contain no food. There is no excess. There is no mess.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>A body is no longer a holistic system. It is not the vehicle through which we experience joy and pleasure. It is not a home to live in and be happy.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In her blog McMansion Hell, Kate Wagner examines precisely why these widely-hated 5000-square foot housing bubble behemoths are so awful. Over and over again, she reiterates the point that McMansions are not built to be homes; they’re built to be short-term investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mcmansionhell.com/post/150597521816/mcmansions-101-revisited-aesthetics-aside-why"><strong>Kate writes</strong></a>, “The inside of McMansions are designed in order to cram the most ‘features’ inside for the lowest costs.” These features exist to increase the house’s resale value, not to make it a good place to live. No thought is given to the labor needed to clean and maintain these spaces. The master bathroom includes intricate stone surfaces that can only be scrubbed with a toothbrush; the cathedral ceilings in the living room raise the heating and cooling costs to an exorbitant sum; the chandelier in the grand entryway dangles so high that no one can replace the bulbs in it, even with a stepladder.</p>



<p>The same fate has befallen our bodies. A body is no longer a holistic system. It is not the vehicle through which we experience joy and pleasure during our brief time in the land of the living. It is not a home to live in and be happy. It, too, is a collection of features: six pack, thigh gap, cum gutters. And these features exist not to make our lives more comfortable, but to increase the value of our assets. Our bodies are investments, which must always be optimized to bring us… what, exactly? Some vague sense of better living? Is a life without bread objectively better than a life with it? When we were children, did we dream of counting every calorie and logging every step?</p>



<p>A generation or two ago, it was normal for adults to engage in sports not purely as self-improvement but as an act of leisure. People danced for fun; couples socialized over tennis; kids played stickball for lack of anything else to do. Solitary exercise at the gym also had a social, rather than moral, purpose. People worked out to look hot so they could attract other hot people and fuck them. Whatever the ethos …</p></div></div>

    <p><img src="https://ekultails.github.io/ekultails-jekyll-uno/images/2021-02-23-chrome-os-vulkan-passthrough.jpg" alt="2021-02-23-chrome-os-vulkan-passthrough"> Passthrough of the Vulkan graphics API library from a QEMU hypervisor to a virtual machine is coming to Linux thanks to work sponsored by Google! This is a big deal for many reasons.</p>

<p>Side note: this is an article I’ve done a lot of research in the past and was surprised that no one else has picked up the pieces yet. So here we are: my first exclusive article! Now that I have a blogging platform, it’s the perfect time and place to share this exciting news! Honestly, this is by far my favorite thing I’m looking forward to in 2021.</p>

<p>As it is today, the <a href="https://virgil3d.github.io/">Virgil 3D GPU project</a> has limited support for OpenGL passthrough to virtual machines. Chrome OS <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-os-76-gpu-support-linux-apps/">already uses Virgil</a> for its Linux (Beta) feature which runs Debian Linux as a LXC container inside of a Chrome OS virtual machine. This allows games to run within the Linux environment with OpenGL acceleration.</p>

<p>The Vulkan passthrough work is being lead by Chia-I Wu who has done work for <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTY4MjA">Valve in the past at LunarG</a> and is currently working at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olvaffe/">Google on “Android Graphics”</a>. Work-in-progress commits have been up for both <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/5800">mesa</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer/-/merge_requests/412">virglrenderer</a> projects for 7 months now. A user named Tomeu Vizoso has also reported that this work extends beyond Chrome OS and works with a normal Linux distribution. The work was originally planned to be released <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=996591#c7">by Google in 2020</a> but likely was pushed pack due to COVID-19 complications.</p>

<p>What can we likely conclude from all of this? A lot, actually.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chromebooks are the main targeted platform. However, the entire Linux community will benefit from this.</li>
  <li>Valve is bringing Steam to Chromebooks via <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/native-steam-borealis-on-chrome-os-likely-arriving-mid-2021/">Borealis</a> (an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine). Steam uses Proton as a compatibility layer for running Windows games on Linux. Valve only officially supports Vulkan (not OpenGL, although you can technically use OpenGL instead of Vulkan) for translating DirectX calls. Borealis is unlikely to be released until the Vulkan passthrough work is done.</li>
  <li>Android is being <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-os-lays-the-groundwork-for-update-to-android-12-snow-cone/">moved to a virtual machine</a> on Chrome OS. Chia-I works on “Android Graphics” so it makes sense that they want to fully support GPU acceleration as they move towards more virtual machines.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Zink-Substantial-Perf-Cominghttps://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Zink-Substantial-Perf-Coming">Zink</a> (OpenGL on Vulkan) will also benefit both Borealis and Android. The Virgil project provides an incomplete form of OpenGL passthrough. By utilizing Zink with full Vulkan support, all of the major graphics back-ends will then be supported on Linux virtual machines. Currently, OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.1 are fully supported via Zink.</li>
</ul>

<p>tl;dr? Chromebooks are about to become the biggest platform to support Linux gaming.</p>

<p>What an exciting time! Will 2021 be the year of the Linux laptop? Chrome OS has just became the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/the-worlds-second-most-popular-desktop-operating-system-isnt-macos-anymore/">second most popular operating system</a> so it’s not impossible! ;-)</p>

<p>UPDATE (2021-02-24):</p>

<p>More bold predictions. Borealis and Chromebooks will be the spiritual successors to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/">Steam OS</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-steam-machines/">Steam Machines</a>!</p>

<p>UPDATE (2021-02-25):</p>

<p>I forgot to also mention that a <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/mushu-chromebook-discrete-gpu-project-athena/">Chromebook with a discrete graphics card</a> has been in development for over a year now. It’s been a long time since I’ve heard about it. I’d bet that it’s being used to test Borealis and so far has not been ready for market due to the lack of Vulkan passthrough support.</p>

<p>UPDATE (2021-03-08):</p>

<p>Some people still think Steam on Chromebooks is a myth. Kan Liu, an executive in charge of Chrome OS, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/01/17/exclusive-google-is-working-to-bring-steam-to-chrome-os/">confirmed at CES 2020 to Android Police staff</a> that Steam is coming to Chromebooks. They also confirmed it will use the same method as Linux on Chromebooks uses (i.e., running Steam in a virtual machine).</p>

</p>
<p>For two years I suffered from severe hand, wrist, and forearm pain while typing.
After spending a lot of money on world-class medical professionals and ergonomic
products but seeing poor results, I was ultimately able to cure all my pain by
reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body-Pain/dp/0446675156">The Mindbody Prescription</a> (TMP). Now I can type for as
long as I want, on any keyboard, in any position, without stretching or taking
breaks, all without any pain. All thanks to changes I made to my mind.</p>
<p>Because my academic background is in mathematics, and because I am a professional
computer programmer, I have a sensitive bullshit detector. If you are like I am,
then my story might trigger your bullshit detector because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The term "mindbody" sounds like unscientific new age nonsense.</li>
<li>It contradicts conventional wisdom about RSI and carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
<li>It sounds too good to be true.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a friend first suggested the book to me, I dismissed it as bullshit. To my
surprise, the TMP book was rigorously scientific, providing a compelling case based
on laboratory and clinical evidence. Of course, that the self-cure procedure worked
for me was the most convincing part.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to encourage other computer users with pain to try
reading the book that had a profound positive impact on my life. This is the article
I wish I had read two years ago.</p>
<p>What follows is a detailed account of my struggle with typing pain, and how I
ultimately eliminated it from my life.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer and entrepreneur. I co-founded AppJet Inc., a software
company that made a popular collaborative word processor called EtherPad, which was
acquired by Google. During the 2.5 years of working on AppJet, I spent the
overwhelming majority of my waking life typing at a keyboard.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed a life-long love affair with computer programming. Before founding
AppJet, I worked at Google, and before that I studied mathematics and computer
science at MIT. I mention these credentials to persuade you that (1) I am a serious
typist, and (2) I possess the intellectual tools necessary to provide a rational
analysis of my RSI ordeal and cure.</p>
<h2>Pain Begins</h2>
<p>I have always typed a lot, but in the first six months of starting AppJet Inc., I
did nothing but type and occasionally sleep.</p>
<p>The final weeks before we launched our first product, I was more caffeinated,
sleep-deprived, and stressed than ever. Two days before launch, I started to
experience severe, nearly crippling wrist pain in my right hand while typing. I
powered through it and continued to work. A few weeks after launching, I felt a
similar pain in my left hand and wrist. Then the pain spread to both wrists and
forearms.</p>
<p>The pain appeared to be located in the muscles of the top (dorsal) side of my wrists
and forearms, between and including the elbows and the wrist joints. The pain was
triggered either by pressing a key on a keyboard or clicking using the mouse. The
muscles felt stiff and sometimes swollen, and extremely painful when pressed or
massaged.</p>
<p>Worried about becoming permanently disabled, I took a quick vacation to rest my
hands and wrists. During this vacation, I went snowboarding and had a nasty fall on
an outstretched (dorsiflexed) hand, which resulted in a painful wrist sprain. This
fall was the source of much confusion over the next year, because I later
hypothesized that it was connected to my ongoing pain while typing. I now believe
this fall was completely incidental and unrelated to the pain I experienced while
typing, but I mention it for the sake of completeness.</p>
<p>After the vacation did nothing to help my pain, I spent much of the next two years
struggling to manage the pain, and in search of a cure. This took a toll on my time
and my wallet. I was fortunate to have the financial means to explore a wide range
of treatment options, though ultimately my cure cost only $10 and a weekend of
reading. In total, I estimate I incurred about $20,000 in unnecessary costs for
doctors, treatments and products that did little or nothing to help with the pain.</p>
<p>In the following section, I chronicle the various things I tried before hitting on
the TMP book that cured me.</p>
<h2>Expensive and Useless Treatments</h2>
<h3>Vacations</h3>
<p>I took more vacations than I would have otherwise liked to, on the theory that I
needed to rest my wrists from typing. Although my wrists did not hurt during the
vacations (because I was not typing), my pain resumed as soon as I got back to work.
I do not believe these vacations had any beneficial effect on my pain. As soon as I
got back to work, the pain resumed as intensely as it had been before I left.</p>
<h3>Chiropractor</h3>
<p>The first medical specialist I consulted was a chiropractor specializing in RSI,
tendonitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p>Over 9 weeks, I regularly went in for traction, adjustments, and massage, with no
noticeable improvement in typing pain. When it was clear that I was not getting
decent results, the chiropractor recommended I consult a hand surgeon, so I
discontinued chiropractic treatment.</p>
<h3>Hand Surgeons</h3>
<p>I talked to four different world-renowned hand surgeons. This matter is complicated
because I was still chasing the idea that my pain could have been caused in part by
my snowboarding wrist sprain, so we were not sure whether to look for RSI, carpal
tunnel, or ligament damage. My goal with the wrist surgeons was to use medical
imaging to identify any structural abnormalities in my hand and wrist.</p>
<p>I had wrist X-rays, an MRI, and a Radiographic Bone Scan, and had the results
analyzed by all four hand and orthopedic surgeons. One surgeon saw no abnormalities
on either imaging results. One surgeon identified a "dorsal capsule fleck" that he
theorized was impinging on part of my wrist joint. Another surgeon thought I had a
torn scapholunate ligament. And the final surgeon thought I had a ganglion cyst.</p>
<p>The four conflicting interpretations of the imaging results did not inspire any
confidence in these guys, so I declined intrusive surgery.</p>
<p>I did try a cortisone injection, which helped temporarily, but soon afterwards the
pain while typing resumed.</p>
<p>I also tried immobilizing my right wrist in a hard cast for four weeks, in case
there was ligament damage from the snowboarding fall that needed healing. From the
beginning of my pain, my right hand consistently hurt more than my left one, and I
was not sure whether this was due to my snowboarding fall or that I use the computer
mouse mainly with my right hand. Immobilizing my right wrist in a hard cast for four
weeks did nothing but atrophy the muscles. There was no affect on the pain; if
anything, it got worse.</p>
<p>None of the surgeons was able to provide a specific and satisfactory anatomical
explanation for why I experienced excruciating pain while typing. I was starting to
get desperate.</p>
<h3>Acupuncture</h3>
<p>I was skeptical about acupuncture because it seemed to be practiced by hippies
rather than doctors. But I met a violinist with similar wrist and forearm problems
who recommended it. She noted that it is important to find a good acupuncturist,
because they vary in their skill for choosing where to place the needles. So I
evaluated five different acupuncturists and found one who was smart and medically
trained.</p>
<p>My first acupuncture appointment provided a great pain relief, but as with the
cortisone, it was only temporary.</p>
<p>Still, temporary pain relief was better than nothing, so I continued to see my
acupuncturist regularly for over a year.</p>
<h3>Massage</h3>
<p>I visited several different massage therapists, each with unique areas of expertise:
Swedish massage, deep tissue, and ART among others. To be sure, it felt very good to
have my wrists and forearms massaged, but the relief was only temporary. My wrists
felt great immediately after the massage session, but after 1 day of rigorous
typing, I would be back in pain. I continued to see a deep-tissue massage therapist
in conjunction with my acupuncturist.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics and Ergonomic Products</h3>
<p>I bought every ergonomic product that I could find, including four different
keyboards, six different mice, monitor stands, keyboard trays, chairs, wrist braces
to wear while typing, wrist braces to wear while sleeping, home forearm massager,
infrared forearm massager, ice packs, hot/cold packs, ultrasonic wrist massager,
stress balls, grip strengtheners and exercisers, and countless others. Nothing
worked.</p>
<p>There is a certain "common knowledge" among computer workers that RSI is the result
of poor ergonomics. This fails to explain why some people can work for long periods
of time under conditions of atrocious ergonomics, but not experience the same pain
that I did. My co-founder David Greenspan, for example, is able to huddle up into a
ball on top of a broken $40 IKEA stool, and stay up all night programming without
the slightest discomfort. I suspect you are jealously aware of people like this in
your own work environment.</p>
<p>s radical as this sounds, I do not think ergonomics has much to do with typing pain.
I recently had a massively productive 10-hour coding session using my laptop
keyboard in a cramped economy seat on a flight from Tokyo to San Francisco. I would
not have dreamed of this two years ago.</p>
<h3>Micro-breaks</h3>
<p><a href="http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/">AntiRSI</a>
and <a href="http://www.lcdf.org/xwrits/">xwrits</a> are software tools that periodically
interrupt you while you are typing to force you to take a break so that you don't
overuse your hand muscles. I tried these programs with varying break intervals and
break lengths, and for me the effect was negligible. I also found it extremely
annoying to be constantly interrupted while I was in the middle of typing
something.</p>
<h3>Text Editors</h3>
<p>Because I am a programmer, I spend much of my typing time inside a text editor.
Programmers tend to be particular about their choice in editor, and my choice was
Emacs.</p>
<p>I used to tell people that they could pry Emacs from my cold, dead hands, but
actually painful wrists were enough to get me to explore other editors.</p>
<p>There is a theory that the "Vi" editor is easier on the wrists because it involves
less chording (holding down …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The picture above shows an installation of a <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/why-iot-platform/" target="_blank">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> IPv6 mesh in the wild. (Although our system is known to be able to run on really, tiny devices operated by a <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">single coin-cell battery</a>, this particular installation does not use those low-power mechanisms as street lights have access to&nbsp;power.)</p>
<p>The big challenge with such a large wireless network is to understand what is going on – and how to develop the software that makes them&nbsp;tick.</p>
<p>In this article we look into how we develop such large-scale systems at Thingsquare and the tools we use. We push the envelope with a 100-hop network, which is larger than what we typically would see in real-world&nbsp;installations.</p>


<h2 id="a-100-node-wireless-testbed">A 100-Node Wireless&nbsp;Testbed</h2>
<p>To see what happens in a 100-hop network, we have built a testbed in our office. The testbed consists of  100 wireless nodes placed in a bookshelf. The nodes all use the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/CC2538" target="_blank"><span>TI</span> CC2538 wireless System-on-a-Chip</a>, running the Thingsquare wireless mesh over a <span>IEEE</span> 802.15.4e low-power radio layer. The nodes are powered by USB, but otherwise have only a wireless connection. Each node also has an LED, which we use to develop and test our wireless lighting system. By default, the nodes form one large wireless&nbsp;network.</p>

A 100-node testbed and the wireless mesh network created by the nodes in the&nbsp;testbed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Because every node in the testbed is close to each other, they can easily form a single-hop network. That is, every node can reach every other node without&nbsp;meshing.</p>
<p>To setup a 100-hop network, we manually configure their routes. This way, we can force the system to become a 100-hop&nbsp;network.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-100-hops">Setting up 100&nbsp;Hops</h3>
<p>After configuring the system to have a 100-hop structure, the mesh looks like&nbsp;this:</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We now have a way to test the system with 100 hops, something that is beyond anything we are likely to see in the&nbsp;wild.</p>
<h3 id="100-hops-in-action">100 Hops in&nbsp;Action</h3>
<p>To see the 100 hops in action, we set up one node to act as a sniffer and run Wireshark to capture the packets from the network. We then ask the node that is 100 hops away to make a secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank"><span>TLS</span> connection</a> with the backend. In the Wireshark logs, we see the <span>TLS</span> traffic as well as the ICMPv6 control traffic that is used by the RPL routing protocol to set up and maintain its routing&nbsp;graph.</p>
<p>(For more in-depth information about the <span>RPL</span> IPv6 routing protocol, see <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/docs/mesh/" target="_blank">this article</a> from our&nbsp;docs.)</p>

<p>If we look at the traffic inside the network, we can see how the packets move from node to node, in a snake-like&nbsp;manner:</p>

<div>
<p>
Packets move through every node in the network, 100 hops in&nbsp;total.

</div>
</div>

<h2 id="in-the-simulator">In the&nbsp;Simulator</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh system is extremely complex and while a testbed is essential to testing the system, it is not enough for developing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>To develop our wireless mesh system, we use our wireless network simulator. The simulator lets us set up the same environment as we see in the real world, but on a single computer. There, we can inspect almost every aspect of the system to see what is going&nbsp;on.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To see a similar behavior as we did our testbed, we set up a simulation with a regular grid of nodes and configure them in a similar fashion as we did in the testbed: they choose parents in the routing graph to make the network as long as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>The simulator also lets us see the packets in a timeline window, where we can see exactly what each node does at any given&nbsp;time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wireless mesh networking allow us to build extremely large-scale networks. But such networks are complex and to build the software that make them tick, we need both hardware testbeds and software&nbsp;simulators.</p>

<p>To serve a Google spreadsheet as API, you need to gather the following config values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google spreadsheet URL, usually in the form of <code>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SPREADSHEET_ID}#gid={SHEET_ID}</code>.</li>
<li>(Optional) Google spreadsheet sheet title (bottom of the spreadsheet UI).
This is required if <code>SHEET_ID</code> is not specified in URL through <code>#gid</code>.</li>
<li>Google spreadsheet service account secret key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to configure the service account:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com">Activate Google Sheets API</a> in the Google API Console.</li>
<li>Create a service account: <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/credentials">https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/credentials</a>.</li>
<li>Go into service account setting, click <code>ADD KEY</code> -&gt; <code>Create new key</code>. Then select JSON format
and save it somewhere safe as a file. <img src="https://roapi.github.io/docs/images/gsheet-add-key.png" alt="gsheet-add-key"></li>
<li>Copy email address for your newly created service account, usually in the format of <code>{ACCOUNT_NAME}@{PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com</code>. <img src="https://roapi.github.io/docs/images/gsheet-service-account-email.png" alt="gsheet-service-account-email"></li>
<li>Open the Google spreadsheet that you want to serve, then share it with the newly created service
account using the service account email. <img src="https://roapi.github.io/docs/images/gsheet-share-service-account.png" alt="gsheet-share-service-account"></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can configure ROAPI to load the google spreadsheet into a table using:</p>
<pre><code>tables:
  - name: "table_name"
    uri: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-lc4oij04aXzFSRMwVBLjU76s-K0-s6UPc2biOvtuuU#gid=0"
    option:
      format: "google_spreadsheet"
      application_secret_path: "path/to/service_account_key.json"
      # sheet_title is optional if `#gid` is specified in uri
      sheet_title: "sheet_name_within_google_spreadsheet"
</code></pre>
<p>ROAPI only invokes Google Sheets API during the initial data load, subsequent
query requests are served using in memory data.</p>
<h2 id="example"><a href="#example">Example</a></h2>
<p>Here is what it looks like to serve <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRodiBkE77d8Y7FLe2BwwNNqy0jc3oSrtsGRrWMXXyAgdl68LxKm_LS0qfMVXa-ioPDP-5jurzKUJ0N/pubhtml">this public google

<![CDATA[The Vizzini Effect]]>

March 7, 2021 | https://www.sicpers.info/2021/03/the-vizzini-effect/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sicpers.info/2021/03/the-vizzini-effect/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>A bunch of the topics I wanted to discuss all turned out to have a common basis, so I’m going to write the post about the commonality using a couple of examples from the specific topics for illumination. Maybe I’ll come back to those topics in more depth later, each one is itself interesting and valuable.</p>
<p>The common thing is the Vizzini Effect, named after the Sicilian in the Princess Bride. In the movie/book, Vizzini often describes events as “inconceivable,” to which Inigo Montoya replies “you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means”. The Vizzini Effect in software engineering (and undoubtedly in other fields of endeavour too, I doubt we’re special) is when the same thing happens: a word or phrase seems to adopt a different meaning such that two different people, or two different groups of people, can mean it to use different things without either seeming malicious or disingenuous. In the examples I’m going to explore here, those groups are separated by time rather than space. But unlike with Vizzini, it’s not that <em>one person</em> is using a word in a weird way, but that <em>collectively</em> software engineers seem to have decided it takes a different meaning.</p>
<h2>Examples of Vizzini Phrases</h2>
<h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>OOP is perhaps the ur-example here, and definitely the one with the most obvious dog-whistle. “I invented the term Object-Oriented Programming,” says Alan Kay, “and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind”. To Alan and that early group of Smalltalk programmers at Xerox, ParcPlace, Tektronix etc., object-oriented programming was extreme late binding and decoupling through message sending. These days, it is often programming in any language that has a “class” keyword, or a straw man meaning any form of mutable state.</p>
<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>In the discussion <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26345235">do you think Agile/Scrum is beneficial for software delivery?</a>, the first answer (at time of writing) says “The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship.” The question asks about the surprising rituals and the extra layers of bureaucracy. That’s the opposite impression than the one I have, where pre-existing software engineering methods tried to minimise or even automate away the programmer contributions. The lightweight methods, promoted by (among others) the agile alliance, sought to build projects around motivated individuals, giving the support they needed but leaving them alone to get the job done. The alliance members thought that the best architectures and designs were created by self-organising teams: a far cry from imposing methodologies to remove power from technical contributors.</p>
<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Design Patterns in software used to refer to the Christopher Alexander idea of identifying repeating problems in architecture and building a shared language that succinctly communicates understanding of the problem, solutions selected, and trade-offs in those solutions. These days it seems to mean any of the <em>examples</em> of design patterns in the Gang of Four book on early-OOP implementation patterns, and no others.</p>
<h3>Free Software</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation and the GNU project were created with the goal of extending desirable human rights and liberties to the world of computing. These days it seems to mean “open source, but said by a person who uses the word actually a lot”.</p>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>The Open Source Initiative was created to generalise the Debian Free Software Guidelines out from the Debian project to general business rules for software, based on the prior successful Open Systems movement and the liberties identified in the Free Software Movement. These days it pretty much means making the components needed to build SaaS subscription products available at zero cost.</p>
<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>In 1967, software engineering was a provocative term, meant to imply that the art of creating software would be somewhat improved if it had a socio-scientific basis. These days software engineering is two words anyone who gets or wants to get paid for programming uses on their CV/résumé.</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>My impression is that three things changed, and that two of them are almost the same. The origins of all of these phrases are in particular times in history, made by particular people, talking in specific contexts. Time has changed, which has changed the context (or at least the relevance of the original context), the people who said the things have changed, and so many new people have entered the field that a majority of practitioners no longer know who the original people were, nor have experienced the context in which they spoke.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible, for example, that the agile methodologies which were lightweight reactions to software engineering around 2000 <em>are</em> oppressively bureaucratic in 2021. We expect to be able to release software multiple times per day now, using analytics and telemetry to understand in real time how it’s being used. The agile folks wanted us to release up to every two weeks and to <em>talk to someone</em> before doing it, ugh!</p>
<p>Some people talk about an <a href="https://newtechusa.net/aic/">Agile-Indu$trial Complex</a>, suggesting that there’s some shady cabal of consultants and certification bodies conspiring to make us all agile so they can profit from it. Again, maybe true. Others talk of companies who “talk the talk without walking the walk”: they got the consultant in, decided which parts of this whole Agile thing sounded nice or relevant, and adopted those things then trumpeted their “fully agile workflow” on their <s>websites</s>fax banners.</p>
<p>And, of course, there’s the telephone game. Even those of us who heard about it from the horse’s mouth—maybe worked on an XP team, or read “Free Software, Free Society”—will have learned a slightly different thing than what the originators were trying to teach us, or thought they were teaching us. When telling others, we’ll have misremembered, and adapted, and extemporised. And so will the people who learned from us, and so on.</p>
<p>The telephone game is subject not only to slow evolution, but to a Byzantine Generals attack. If someone wants, for example, OOP to die so that their preferred paradigm get used instead, they can inject a false message into the call graph. This is where Vizzini meets Lewis Carroll’s Humpty-Dumpty: I keep using this word, and <em>I</em> do not think it means what you think it means.</p>
<p>Take into account the fact that most people who work in software now didn’t work in software five years ago, and that this was true five years ago and so on, and you realise that the <em>vast majority</em> of people will have learned about any “classic” idea in software from a telephone conversation.</p>
<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p>Well, the first question to answer is, does anything particularly <em>need</em> to be done? Maybe these are ideas that have had their time, and can just fizzle out. But evidently for all of the examples above enough people want the ideas to continue that they (well, <em>we</em> obviously) keep trying to dredge the original discussions out of the history books and put them back into contemporary discourse. To do this, they need recontextualising. For example, nobody cares that Richard Stallman couldn’t get a printer driver in the 1970s, but maybe they <em>do</em> care that there are things that they aren’t allowed to do with the smartphones they think they paid for. That’s how ideas of software freedom could be reintroduced.</p>
<p>Maybe the original phrase has become toxic and needs to be retired, without the original meaning being lost too. That is, whether you like it or not, the reason that “Open Source” was created as a term: to remove deliberate and accidental confusion over the word “freedom” in a business context, and to provide familiarity to people who had already adopted Open Systems ideas. It’s why Devops exists: to tell the stories of Agile again, but to those who didn’t listen the first time, or who listened and heard the wrong thing.</p>
<p>The telephone game can’t be avoided. You have to keep telling the stories if you want new people to hear them, and that means accepting alterations in their re-telling. And you need there to be more than one raconteur, even if they’re telling slightly different versions of the story. Don’t count messiahs, count prophets. Only don’t count prophets, count gospels. Only don’t count gospels, count churches. Only don’t count churches, count preachers.</p>
<p>You’re never going to get every programmer or software professional in the world to agree with your interpretation of some phrase. But you can use contextually-relevant stories to tell people things that might help them make better software, and you can follow up “I do not think that means what you think it means” with a conversation in which you both learn something. Maybe it’s your understanding that’s wrong?</p>
<p>Inconceivable!</p>
<h3>P.S.</h3>
<p>I do a lot of writing, podcasting, presenting, and streaming about how to make software. Most of it has been free, still is free, and I don’t intend to change that. It’d be great if you are able and willing, for you to support that free work by <a href="https://patreon.com/iamleeg">becoming a patron</a>. No obligation!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>A very common view on banking can be summarized by the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Banks accept deposits from savers and then loan those deposits out to borrowers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how banking really works. The truth is that there’s no law that says that deposits need to be at least equal to or greater than outstanding loans. In fact, banks can loan out much more money than they have in deposits.  Which leads us to the question, <em>where does this extra money come from?</em> Is it just created from thin air? The short answer is <strong>yes</strong> - it’s called <strong>credit</strong> and it’s much more widespread than you might think.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-credit">What is credit?</h2>

<p>Imagine you go shopping at your neighbourhood grocery store. When you go up to pay for your groceries, you realize you’ve forgotten your wallet at home. Let’s say your groceries cost $20. The clerk, knowing you’re a trustworthy person, writes on a slip of paper that you owe him $20. You’re off the hook until the next time you visit the grocery store. Poof! The clerk just created $20 dollars out of thin air.</p>

<p>Let’s explore why that is the case. You can now go home and spend a $20 dollar bill that would have been used for groceries however you’d like. But the clerk’s slip of paper also functions as money, and this is precisely the money that was created. Who would have thought that grocery store clerks had the power to create money?</p>

<p>But how exactly does the slip of paper function as money? Let’s take our example a little further. It just so happens that the store clerk is a big cookie aficionado and your grandma is the best baker in town. The clerk can now visit your grandma and buy $20 worth of cookies in exchange for the paper slip. You now owe your grandma the $20 dollars you owed the clerk. The new $20 worth of money created doesn’t exit the <em>money supply</em> (the total amount of money in the economy) until you pay up the debt and tear up the slip of paper.</p>

<p>From this example, we can see that credit is inherently built on trust. The clerk would have never issued the paper slip if he didn’t trust that at some point in the future, you would pay for your groceries. And for the paper slip to be functionally equivalent to money, it needs other people to trust it, not just your grandma.</p>

<p>The paper slip is what we call credit, which is simply <em>an agreement between two parties on payment for resources at a later date</em>. Note that credit inherently creates <strong>debt</strong> simoultaneously - the store clerk gets the credit but you have a debt to pay it back.</p>

<p>Banks function similar to the clerk in our example, except they do it on a much larger scale and there’s widespread trust in the credit they issue. In fact, most of what we normally call money in the economy is actually credit and only a tiny amount is cash, i.e. physical coins and bills.</p>

<p>To tie it all together, when a bank creates a loan, it enters a new number into your bank account with just a few taps, effectively increasing the total amount of money in the world. But is there any difference between this new money and the physical dollar bill in my hand?</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-bank-deposits-and-cash">What’s the difference between bank deposits and cash?</h2>

<p>The difference between the terms <em>credit</em>, <em>money</em> and <em>cash</em> is blurry. In everyday life, bank deposits (credit) are treated as cash, and we refer to both as money. However, another common misconception is that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bank deposits are synonymous with cash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The assumption that these two terms are <em>perfectly equivalent</em> is erroneous, and although it is generally true this assumption breaks down under extreme conditions. Let’s explore what these conditions are.</p>

<p>A helpful trick is to think about bank deposits as being denominated in different currencies that are pegged to a national currency, such as the U.S. dollar, one-to-one.<sup id="fnref:banktrust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:banktrust">1</a></sup> Let’s say that you are a customer of Bank of America (BAC). When you go to the ATM to withdraw cash, what you’re really saying is:</p>

<p><em>I’m going to exchange x BAC dollars for x U.S. dollars</em></p>

<p>And voilà, you’ve now converted BAC dollars from the chequing account stored on a computer server to physical U.S. dollars. This seems like a lot of mental gymnastics but bear with me.</p>

<figure>
    <p><img src="https://halldorbjarni.github.io/assets/img/bank_note.png" alt="A bank note issued by the Bank of North Carolina in 1859. This bank note is somewhat analogous to an online bank deposit today.">
    </p>
    <figcaption><i>A bank note issued by the Bank of North Carolina in 1859. This bank note is somewhat analogous to an online bank deposit today.</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>When you went to the ATM to withdraw cash, the Bank of America had to find those U.S. dollars to give to you. Remember, <em>credit is a promise for a payment in the future</em>. When you originally deposited U.S. dollars into your chequing account, credit was created with a promise to pay you back your original U.S. dollars in the future. The credit was the BAC dollar amount displayed in your bank account. However this didn’t create new money since Bank of America still had your U.S. dollars in its vault. Meanwhile, Bank of America is free to <strong>create</strong> new money by making loans to borrowers. Creating loans means issuing more BAC dollars as bank deposits. And the bank deposits can quickly grow much larger than the cash in the bank’s vault.</p>

<p>Now, back to our question. Under what conditions does the assumption that <em>bank deposits equal cash</em> break?</p>

<p>What happens when <em>Bank of America doesn’t have enough U.S. dollar bills when the time comes for your ATM withdrawal?</em> It must sell some of its assets, like stocks, for U.S. dollars. If the bank doesn’t have enough assets, or the assets turn out to be very hard to sell, the bank runs the risk of defaulting on its obligations to you and becoming <em>insolvent</em>. And you might not get all of the U.S. dollars you deposited back from the bankruptcy process; for every BAC dollar you might only get 50 U.S. cents. This risk is one of the reasons <em>banks cannot create an infinite amount of money</em>. When a bank defaults, it violates our one-to-one assumption of BAC dollars to U.S. dollars and we can see why cash and bank deposits are not perfectly equivalent.</p>

<p>Any time the bank is forced to convert its own currency to U.S. dollars it has to find those U.S. dollars somewhere. This can happen when people transfer money to a different bank or make a cash withdrawal: anything that takes money out of the world of that bank. Keeping this much cash on hand is costly since it doesn’t earn interest<sup id="fnref:centralbank" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:centralbank">2</a></sup>, so banks invest in long term assets such as stocks and bonds. The bank doesn’t want to be forced to sell those assets at an unfortunate time. In fact, massive selling could cause the value of those assets to plummet even further. This is why banks come up with ATM withdrawal limits, withdrawal fees and accounts with less flexibility to withdraw, like savings accounts. It’s all done to incentivize customers to refrain from forcing the bank to convert its made-up currency into the national one.</p>

<p>Insolvencies used to happen very frequently in the past and they are a long way from being extinct. A recent example is the British bank <em>Northern Rock</em> in 2009. The bank defaulted during the financial crisis and a lot of people lost most of their deposits. When people sense that a bank is at a risk of becoming insolvent, they will rush to withdraw their deposits. This is frequently referred to as a <strong>bank run</strong><sup id="fnref:fdic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fdic">3</a></sup>. The psychological herd mentality fuelling bank runs ironically increases the chances of the bank becoming insolvent. The bank might not be able to sell its assets for a good enough price all at once so the crowd’s fear of insolvency becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>It’s a common misconception that banks loan out cash that has been deposited. A bank can, in fact, create money out of nothing via loans and it’s called <em>credit</em>. This works because bank deposits function as the bank’s own currency. If the bank issues too much of this currency it runs the risk of becoming insolvent. This often results in a bank run and the illusion that bank deposits are equal to cash is lifted.</p>

<p>When banks issue too much credit it is often referred to as a credit bubble. A credit bubble behaves in a lot of similar ways as stock bubbles (see my earlier blog <a href="https://halldorbjarni.github.io/the-psychology-of-stock-bubbles/">post</a>). Few people know it’s a bubble until it bursts. The stock and credit markets are systems controlled by the whims of humans and are therefore bound by the laws of psychology. It follows that we shouldn’t be surprised that they exhibit the same imperfections as human nature with all its heighs and lows.</p>

What a year it’s been! Shortly after we posted the article, the rest of 2020 quickly became a very strange year. Like everyone else, we endured moving our entire team over to remote working and the challenges that brings from artistic to technical hurdles. Fortunately even though the whole world came to a crashing halt, we continued to produce animation. But more importantly, software development for the Mac continued and we’re now entering a very exciting time with more support than ever for professional tools designed for the Mac Pro which really begin to take advantage of its power.</p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="45.370370370370374" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612621230889_28058"><div>

</div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612636471491_143700"><div><p>As we specialise in 3D computer animation, the software we use isn’t always obvious and there are a few different options out there. So we thought we would list out what we currently use at the studio for production and it will give context to aspects of the piece when referring to software support and new software options we’ve been testing. These are all industry standard pieces of software used to create most TV and feature films.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612636471491_654466"><div><p>So you get your new Mac Pro, unbox it and plug it in. You install all the software you were using on your previous machine. At first in many ways it feels familiar, you’re staring at the same macOS, but then you realise you’ve got deadlines to meet and need to get working on your CGI shots, whether that’s character animation, simulation, lighting and rendering. Suddenly the only thing that matters is the content you’re making and that’s what we’re going to look at – the noticeable things that this machine really helps with once you start working as an artist.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613091298668_83819"><div><p>OK, we all know the machine is fast and it should be, I mean the spec says it is. However when you’re working on a 3D animation project, you’re dealing with really heavy 3D scenes, that are carrying millions of polygons of geometry, characters, lights. A great example of a project like this is a commercial we made at the end of 2020, with our partners over at<a href="https://roger.tv/"> Roger</a> in LA for the<a href="https://www.hulu.com/hulu-disney-espn-bundle-offer"> Disney Bundle</a>. It was a challenging project that involved shots which had an entire city with people and cars, along with elements of pretty much every major IP you can think of. You can watch the commercial below to give you context:</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_310147"><div><p>On an iMac Pro workstation you might struggle to open a scene like this, but on the Mac Pro we’re able to actively work on the scene with multiple applications open at the same time.</p><p>What this means is that rather than having to close the heavy scene, load up the 3D model we want to adjust and then close that and reopen the original scene to continue working, we are able to simply switch spaces in macOS, add a light to a 3D model and quickly switch back and check the update with the interactive IPR renderer.</p><p>Then while we’re waiting for that to create a preview render, we can switch over to another screen and adjust another model.</p><p>What we’re seeing here is the fluidity of the artist working and not having to be ground to a halt because the computer is having to think. It feels like having multiple computers at your fingertips. All without constant crashing, which means we avoid losing work and more importantly save artists’ time.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613091298668_214984"><p>Above you can see a video we have recorded to try and showcase what this is like when working on something like this. Anybody that works professionally in this field will appreciate that being able to continuously work without getting bogged down is incredibly exciting.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612621230889_59119"><div><p>If you’re a technical effects artist then you’ll be used to working in a piece of software like Houdini and spending your time constantly setting off simulations, whether that’s liquid or smoke simulations and these are all widely known to be very slow to create. On a daily basis you might be submitting those to a render farm in the studio for other computers to evaluate while you continue working on something else.</p><p>However we’ve noticed while working on the Mac Pro, you can easily simulate in the background while continuing to work, all without seeing any major performance hits. The video below demonstrates adjusting a simulation and setting another one off while continuing to work on another scene.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_591326"><div><p>Depending on the type of simulation you’re doing you can run more than one, based on whether the simulation is using the CPU or GPU to do the calculation. For example cloth and grain is typically calculated using the GPU, and if you have four GPUs in your Mac Pro then you can utilise all of them working away in the background.</p><p>This kind of workflow is something that has become evidently more important in the last 12 months since our artists have been working remotely away from the studio. One of the challenges with effects and simulations is the amount of data that is created in a simulation cache. It’s easy to create frames that are a gigabyte each and suddenly you need to be able to upload terabytes of data back to the studio to render. The ability to work on a Mac Pro and feel like you have a little renderfarm inside is extremely powerful.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_811766"><div><p>If you’re a character animator, performance is always very important, because every time you want to see your characters move you don’t want to have to play-blast it, which essentially means rendering the animation out to a video file to be able to preview.</p><p>As you can imagine this slows the animator down and play-blasting is often common practice if you have multiple characters in a 3D scene. So we wanted to take a look at what animation performance improvements we get out of the door when working with characters on a Mac Pro. The video to the right is the cinematic for Gods of Olympus. We’ll be looking at one of the shots from the cinematic with nine characters and how it performs with playback.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1613091298668_258695"><p>So all nine characters playback at real time 24 frames per second (The frame number fluctuates but this is common when hitting the play button it can take a while to settle down). Which is very impressive for so many characters in a Maya scene. In the video you will also see that if we turn on cached playback which essentially saves the characters movement in the 3D scene and is intelligent so it will only need to re-cache the changes that are made as you animate. With this turned on and along with ‘Play Every Frame, Free’ which uncaps the speed of playback we now see up to 50 frames per second.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612636471491_396815"><div><p>One of the really nice things about the Pro Display XDR is the size and resolution. Typically with 3D animation software, they always seem to have multiple windows, graphs, node editors and viewports, due to their complexity and managing all of these windows can be tricky. It’s relatively common for animators to use a second display when working. However at our studio most of our artists use a single 27inch 5K iMac Pros. The reality when using larger displays from a 27” and upwards is that you really have to turn your head to look from one monitor to the other while working and with the ability in macOS to easily switch between screens (or another space), that need for a second display starts to disappear. The only challenge if working on a single screen is being able to fit all of the animation controls into that single display comfortably. Now with a 6K 32” display we might have the perfect balance.</p><p>So we have laid out the typical character animation setup in Maya on both a 27” 5K iMac Pro and 32inch Pro Display XDR and how this looks from an operational point of view. The additional screen real estate is immediately giving the animator an entire character picker without losing any or the perspective or camera views in the scene. You can click each image to see it in its full resolution. Being able to fit all of this on a single display is amazing for animating with and this kind of benefit is the same with other workflows like effects and simulation, lighting and rendering.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612722024119_1134798"><div><p><br>We wanted to elaborate on the P3-DCI support with the Pro Display XDR, I know in our last blog post we described the new monitor as a game changer when we were working on the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7975244/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Jumanji:The Next Level</a> end titles at the time of receiving the new Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR.</p><p>P3-DCI is not a format that is going to be used by most creatives out there, you need to be working on feature film content designed for the American film industry, but for a studio like ourselves, now having three of the displays within the studio gives us the ability to do something we simply couldn’t before. </p></div></div></div><div><div data-aspect-ratio="52.87037037037037" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612649579666_554134"><div>

The only reason I can help this range of companies is because they are all using the same principles of software development to accomplish their goals.</p><p>Internet-enabled software is in <a href="https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/2020-06-30-mega-cycles-of-technological-revolutions/">the deployment phase</a>, where it becomes so ubiquitous as to be second nature. <strong>Asking which city will be the next tech hub is like asking which industry will use software.</strong></p><p>Of course, all industries use software. And any city that wants to stay economically relevant will need to figure out how to attract people that build it. San Francisco and Austin and Miami are some of the best positioned places to do this. But the "tech industry" is too big for one city.</p><p>What's a better question?</p><p>The most interesting industries are not the ones software is eating, but the new ones it's creating. Things that weren't possible or economically feasible before. Autonomous cars. Virtual reality. Social networks.</p><p>So, what new types of cities might the internet create?</p><h3 id="cities-and-ambitions"><strong>Cities and ambitions</strong></h3><p>To answer that question, we need to understand what makes cities great. Paul Graham wrote <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html">an essay</a> about this that starts:</p><blockquote>Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.</blockquote><p>Humans are <a href="https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/">mimetic creatures</a>—always looking at what others are doing, comparing ourselves to it, and copying their behaviors. Bigger cities, by nature of their size, will have more ambitious people. But it's once ambitious people are surrounded by other ambitious people that something interesting happens. They start feeding off of each other.</p><p>Geoffrey West, an academic who left the field of physics to explore new pastures,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyCY6mjWOPc"> has quantified this effect</a> by showing a strong relationship between the population of cities, higher wages, and more creative people:</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Jmil1ZpCp3xxIGBxKNxYB3VAnuL14qCg7zoOCti-4RhYxSo-c5KMGX_vPAPcEGZbIsEtmyP2a3zQQfVFt89K-17qoWRwMYenzV9H5p0b9YpRoKcBv0u6LnP9tWEhVga_qPzTVrpZ" alt=""></figure><p>But this chart is on a log scale, which is just a fancy way of saying it’s an exponential relationship: <strong>interesting people attract more interesting people.</strong> Once there's a critical mass of them, other people start noticing and emulating them. This creates even more novel ways of doing things, and more people get in on the fun. Pretty soon you have a culture.</p><h3 id="people-vs-places">People vs. places</h3><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxgHyPCCqaw&amp;t=1254">West goes on to explain</a> that when you think of cities, you think of the boulevards of Paris and the Eiffel Tower, you think of the skyscrapers of New York. But that's just the stage. It's the platform on which the social networks and information and creativity is taking place. It facilitates the daily social interaction that creates ideas, wealth, and stimulates innovation.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2YfZZoi-IISxClAzJ77YXM-tWJENYFBRt5m9uSCrMdZTgOvEdhmaGXqE6CmDubfU4Lsy9BifafPKmbisdaMb1vOhfiqLKjXgOkmX0mgn6K_P-315h91HOztrx0iopqoRl4f3cc5u" alt=""></figure><p>It's not the place that matters, it's <strong>the density of creative ideas and interesting people.</strong> When I think about where I meet interesting people, it’s increasingly not in a physical place at all. It’s on Twitter threads and Discord channels and WhatsApp groups.</p><p>In the Facebook era, people met in person and then became “friends” online. But it makes more sense to do the opposite: <strong>find your friends online and then meet up in person.</strong> There are at least 1000x more people to choose from online, and they conveniently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(internet)">gather into easily identifiable tribes</a>. People in the dating pool are the most highly motivated searchers for strong new connections, and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Rosenfeld_et_al_Disintermediating_Friends.pdf">they have figured this out in droves</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ppp-bWQMTfDGDxctBK2E5bcSr9KU-X7FMuCwin3fzmoVuXPR3VyqFWfSz-kkZtA0tFpuD4amrpPbC-PSvWZ-gBfao_eVlc9wfA8VvwpBvX2Vh43iUyGEeYJK1XcwYUJIxgQ2dNp_" alt=""></figure><p>But the physical world still matters. Once people connect, they need meatspace to come together, break bread, be present, and immerse themselves in the environment. Maybe someday there will be virtual realities with the same bandwidth as the real world, but for now, you can’t beat good old fashioned reality.</p><p>So how do we get the best of cities and the best of the internet? <strong>What if creative, ambitious people found each other online and then decided to get together in the same place?</strong></p><h3 id="let-s-build">Let's build</h3><p>This is the premise of <a href="https://www.creatorcabins.com/">Creator Cabins</a>, the community of remote cabins for remote workers and independent online creators that we're building in the Texas Hill Country, about 45 minutes outside of Austin. Here’s a view from the deck of our first cabin:</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QOFeBMm3JchaPdr09JjKj1Skz3QPHRVpqPW-Sw3db_T-edLdAk34jYmSIupp7ZZm6BCYw5Cx4ShpnuVRpI3Wl2E-465QqwEutP6RK4d9HceuoOBNcK8j0jkU0p_n7c2cI-HZ9m1H" alt=""></figure><p>Like any good startup, it's a simple premise with an ambitious goal. For now, it's a place to get together IRL with your internet friends. In the future, I hope it becomes one node in a network of decentralized properties, owned and operated by small groups of independent online creators and entrepreneurs. The density of creative energy of San Francisco or New York, but wherever and whenever you want it to be. If you were designing a 21st century city from scratch, why would you put it all in one place?</p><p>Follow this idea to its logical conclusion and you can end up in some wild territory. Neal Stephenson wrote about independent distributed city-state Burbclaves in his mind-bending 1992 science fiction classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash"><em>Snow Crash</em></a>. James Dale Davidson envisioned not just sovereign suburbs, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AK9IXXM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">sovereign individuals</a> around the same time. Davidson's buddy Peter Thiel helped popularize the idea of <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/">Seasteading</a> more recently. And now, Balaji Srinivasan is talking about exiting to cloud-first <a href="https://1729.com/introduction/">Network States</a>.</p><p>Many of these visions make my network of cabins look woefully unambitious by comparison. But my goal isn't some grand libertarian exit from society. <strong>I just want to take more of the magical serendipity of the internet and bring it into high-bandwidth reality.</strong> First, we'll have <a href="https://www.creatorcabins.com/cabins">cabins</a>. Then there will be <a href="https://www.creatortowns.com/">towns</a>. Eventually, I think we'll have a network that really does resemble a city.</p><p>I won't pretend to know exactly where this is headed. The best cities aren't planned, they evolve. But if Creator Cabins has an ambition, a central cultural tenet, I hope it is one of people gaining greater independence over their work and lives by earning a living online. I am inspired by independent online creators, writers, artists, and entrepreneurs—so I'm making a place for us to gather and meet each other and create even better things.</p><p><em>If you’d like to be a part of it, </em><a href="https://www.creatorcabins.com/book"><em>come visit</em></a><em>!

	<section>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			There was recently an <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/okafyi/euler_s_fizzbuzz">article</a> submitted on Lobsters, which
			discussed a pretty clever approach to the FizzBuzz problem using some number theory.
		</p>
		<p>
			The approach is sufficient granted that each chosen FizzBuzz number is a <b>distinct</b> prime, but when we start involving composite numbers
			things begin to get a little hairy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the language used in the article led me to believe that the subtler details of this latter situation
			were overlooked. I aim to discuss those here.
		</p>
		<p>
			The question was asked: <b><q>does this [approach] hold true for every n we might choose?</q></b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The author seemed to imply throughout the text that the answer to this question is yes, but the answer is actually <b>no</b>, as we will work out.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, the following claim was made:
			<b><q>The numbers chosen as factors do not need to be prime, but if one of them has another as a factor, some groups will not exist</q></b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The example that was given in this context involved choosing FizzBuzz numbers \(2\) and \(4\), so that numbers that
			are divisible by \(2\) yield \(Fizz\), and numbers that are divisible by \(4\) yield \(FizzBuzz\).
		</p>
		<p>
			To the passing reader, this might makes sense. Clearly numbers that are divisible by \(4\) are divisible by both \(2\) and \(4\), and
			so we shouldn't expect to ever just see \(Buzz\).
		</p>
		<p>
			This intuition is actually misleading in the sense that even though it seems logical at first, there are other things going on under the surface
			that don't really have much to do with sharing factors.
		</p>
		<p>
			In fact, it isn't just the case that things get weird when the chosen FizzBuzz numbers share factors. It even happens when they are non-prime coprimes!
		</p>
		<p>
			It's worth mentioning that this is actually my first personal technical blog post, and I can't think of a more fitting thing to write about than mathematics.
			I hope that there is some meaningful discussion as a result, and that folks gain something from reading along.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				I want to emphasize that what follows is not an attack on the author of the linked article or their work, but instead just a critique /
				commentary on some of the mathematics used and explanations given.
			</b>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Acknowledging my borderline excessive linking</h2>
		<p>
			As you make your way through this post, you'll notice that I have linked to a lot of external resources, and at times perhaps the
			explanations that I give might seem a bit handwavy, especially to readers who aren't familiar with the underlying mathematics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The following content is already quite long, and if I were to go off into the weeds to explain every little detail, it would be
			much longer. The hope is that you will become curious where you want to be, and explore some of the topics discussed as necessary / desired.
		</p>
		<p>
			That being said, I know that there is a lot being covered, and so if <i>anything</i> is not clear,
			I am open and looking forward to any ensuing discussions, whether it be via e-mail or in the comments on Lobsters.

		<h2>Revisiting the proposed solution</h2>
		<p>
			I'm not going to restate the entire article here, and I will assume that you have at least skimmed through it and have a general
			understanding about what the proposed generalized FizzBuzz solution looks like.
		</p>
		<p>I encourage you to play around with different FizzBuzz numbers and see what you come up with.</p>
		<p>For the purposes of our discussion, I restate the proposed solution, albeit somewhat differently (I've added a bit more detail for context):</p>
		<p>Given:
			</p><ul>
				<li>\(n_1, n_2,...,n_k \in \mathbb{Z}^+\) — the FizzBuzz numbers, for example \(n_1=3, n_2=5\)</li>
				<li>\(N=n_1\cdot n_2...\cdot n_k\) — known as the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Congruence">Modulus</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					\(e=LCM(\phi(n_1),\phi(n2)...,\phi(n_k))\) — where \(\phi\) is
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function">Euler's Totient Function</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A set \(W\) of FizzBuzz words, where \(\vert W\vert = k\), the number of FizzBuzz numbers —
					for example \(k = 2\) and \(W = \{Fizz, Buzz\}\)
				</li>
				<li> A bijective function \(f\colon \{n_1,n_2,...,n_k\} \to W\) that takes each \(n_i\) to a distinct \(w_i\in W\), and vice-versa</li>
					<ul><li>Let \(f(n_i)\cdot f(n_k) = w_i\cdot w_k\) denote the concatenation of two elements of W</li></ul>
			</ul>
		
		<p>
			The author claims that we can define a function (which we'll call the <b>FizzBuzz assignment function</b>):
			\begin{equation}
			g(a) =
			\begin{cases}
				a &amp; \text{if \(h(a) = 1 \;(\bmod\; N)\)}\\
				f(n_i)\cdot f(n_{i+1})\cdot ... f(n_j) &amp; \text{if \(h(a)\) implies that \(a\) is divisible by \(n_i,...,n_j\); \(i \leq j\),}\\
				&amp; \text{(note that when \(i = j\) we get the singular case, i.e. \(Fizz\))}
				\end{cases}
			\end{equation}

			where:

			\begin{equation}
			h(a) = a^e\;(\bmod\; N)\equiv
			\begin{cases}
				0\;(\bmod\; N) &amp; \text{if \(N\;\vert\; a\) (and so all \(n_1...n_k\) divide \(a\))}\\
				r_{n_h,...,n_j}\;(\bmod\; N) &amp; \text{if \(a\) is divisible by all \(n_i\) } \textit{except }\text{for \(n_h,...,n_j\)}\\
				1\;(\bmod\; N) &amp; \text{if \(a\) is relatively prime to N (and so all \(n_1...n_k\))}\\
				\end{cases}
			\end{equation}

			That supposedly provides a general solution to the FizzBuzz problem. Let's try out a few examples.
			</p><p>
				<b>Note:</b> The function construction claims are just that — claims. As we'll see, the prescribed means of construction doesn't hold true for all cases.
				In other words, we will see conditions on the right hand side start to fail.
			</p>
		
		<h3>Examples</h3>
			<h4>Example 1</h4>
				Let \(n_1=3\) and \(n_2=5\), so that:
				<ul>
					<li>\(N=15\)</li>
					<li>\(e=LCM(\phi(n_1),\phi(n_2))=LCM(2,4)=4\)</li>
					<li>\(W = \{Fizz, Buzz\}\)</li>
					<li>The function \(f\) is defined such that \(f(3) = Fizz\) and \(f(5) = Buzz\)</li>
				</ul>

				Then:

				\begin{equation}
				g(a) =
				\begin{cases}
					a &amp; \text{if \(h(a) = 1 \;(\bmod\; 15)\)}\\
					Fizz &amp; \text{if \(h(a)\) implies \(a\) is divisible by \(3\) and not \(5\)}\\
					Buzz &amp; \text{if \(h(a)\) implies \(a\) is divisible by \(5\) and not \(3\)}\\
					FizzBuzz &amp; \text{if \(h(a) = 0  \;(\bmod\; 15)\)}\\
					\end{cases}
				\end{equation}

				and we define \(h(a)\) using the author's methods in the article:

				\begin{equation}
				h(a) = a^e\;(\bmod\; 15)\equiv
				\begin{cases}
					0\;(\bmod\; 15) &amp; \text{if \(15\;\vert\; a\)}\\
					6\;(\bmod\; 15) &amp; \text{if \(a\) is divisible by \(3\) and relatively prime to \(5\)}\\
					10\;(\bmod\; 15) &amp; \text{if \(a\) is divisible by \(5\) and relatively prime to \(3\)}\\
					1\;(\bmod\; 15) &amp; \text{if \(a\) is relatively prime to \(15\) (and so \(3\) and \(5\))}
					\end{cases}
				\end{equation}
			

			<p>Let's try out some values:</p>
			<p>
				For \(a = 3\), calculating \(a^e\;(\bmod\; 15)=3^4 \;(\bmod\; 15)\) yields \(6\), so that \(g(a) = Fizz\). So far so good!
				Similarly, \(a = 5\), calculating \(a^e\;(\bmod\; 15)=5^4 \;(\bmod\; 15)\) yields \(10\), so that \(g(a) = Buzz\) as expected.
			</p>
			<p> I'll leave it to you to verify that \(a = 15\) would lead us to \(FizzBuzz\).</p>
			<p>Let's try an \(a\) that isn't completely obvious:</p>
			<p>
				Let \(a = 3796875\). We can tell it's divisible by \(5\) because there is a \(5\) in the ones place. We can also tell that it
				is divisible by \(3\) because the sum of the digits is divisible by \(3\) (if you're not familiar with this trick google
				<q>divisible by 3 trick</q>).
			</p>
			<p>Our expected output, then, should be \(FizzBuzz\). Let's verify that:</p>
			<p>\(a^4 \;(\bmod\; 15)=3796875^4 \;(\bmod\; 15)\) yields \(0\), so that \(g(a) = FizzBuzz\). Cool!</p>

			<h4>Initial reasonings for why this example works</h4>
			<p>
				Let's see if we can try to understand what's going on in this case. \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are both prime in the example,
				so we'll try to find out what we can determine from that:</p>
			<p>Let \(n_1,n_2\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) be distinct primes, so that \(\phi(n_1)=n_1-1\) and \(\phi(n_2)=n_2-1\).</p>
			<p>Then \(e = LCM(n_1-1,n_2-1)=(n_1-1)\cdot(n_2-1)=\phi(n_1n_2)\).</p>
			<h5>FizzBuzz</h5>
			<p>In order to get \(FizzBuzz\), we need \(a^e\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\equiv 0\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\). Let's suppose that this is the case. But then:</p>
			<p>
				\(a^e\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\equiv 0\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2) \iff n_1n_2\;\vert\;a^e\iff n_1\;\vert\;a^e\) and \(n_2\;\vert\;a^e\iff n_1\;\vert\;a\) and \(n_2\;\vert\;a\)
			</p>
			<p>That is to say, we only get \(FizzBuzz\) when both \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) divide \(a\).</p>
			<h5>Neither Fizz nor Buzz</h5>
			<p>In order to get neither, we need  \(a^e\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\equiv 1\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\). Let's suppose that this is the case.</p>
			<p>
				Recall that due to our choice of \(n_1\) and \(n_2\), we have \(e=\phi(n_2n_2)\). In other words
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem">Euler's Theorem</a> applies. i.e.
			</p>
			<p>
				 \(a^e\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\equiv 1\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\iff a\) is relatively prime to \(n_1n_2\iff a\) is relatively prime to both \(n_1\) and \(n_2\).
			</p>
			<p>So we get neither \(Fizz\) nor \(Buzz\) precisely when \(a\) is relatively prime to both \(n_1\) and \(n_2\).
			</p><h5>Exactly one of Fizz or Buzz</h5>
			<p>
				Our discussion above implicitly shows that we get exactly one of \(Fizz\) or \(Buzz\) in the case that \(a\) is divisible
				by exactly one of \(n_1\) or \(n_2\), since otherwise one of the previous cases would apply.
			</p>
			<p>
				To state differently, this happens exactly when \(a\) is congruent to neither \(0\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\) nor  \(1\;(\bmod\; n_1n_2)\).
			</p>

			<h4>Example 2</h4>
				Let \(n_1=4\) and \(n_2=16\) so that:
				<ul>
					<li>\(N=64\)</li>
					<li>\(e=LCM(\phi(4), \phi(16))=LCM(2, 8)\) = 8</li>
					<li>\(W = \{Fizz, Buzz\}\)</li>
					<li>The function \(f\) is defined such that \(f(4) = Fizz\) and \(f(16) = Buzz\)</li>
				</ul>

				And our \(FizzBuzz\) assignment function should look something like this:

				\begin{equation}
				g(a) =
				\begin{cases}
					a &amp; \text{if \(h(a)=1\;(\bmod\; 64)\)}\\
					Fizz &amp; \text{if \(h(a)\) implies \(a\) is divisible by \(4\) and not \(16\)}\\
					Buzz &amp; \text{if \(h(a)\) implies \(a\) is divisible by \(16\) and not \(4\)}\\
					FizzBuzz &amp; \text{if \(h(a)=0\;(\bmod\; 64)\)}\\
					\end{cases}
				\end{equation}

				<p>Now we need to construct \(h(a)\). Let's first deal with \(n_1=4\):</p>
				<p>
					We need to figure out what \(a^8 \;…</p></section></div>

<p><a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/"><em>The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect</em></a> is a collaborative effort aimed at a general audience by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl">Judea Pearl</a>, a professor of computer science at UCLA, and <a href="http://danamackenzie.com/">Dana Mackenzie</a>, a science writer. As a medical student with a laughably poor formal education in statistics, I believe I qualify as a card-carrying member of the general audience. Here's my review in three parts: i) an overview of topics covered by the book, ii) my thoughts, and iii) links to other reviews and further reading.</p>
<p>The book grounds Pearl's theoretical work on causal inference in a multitude of realistic and real examples, drawn from a range of disciplines including economics, biology, and law. Pearl himself is a pretty <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/pearl_2658896.cfm">Big Deal</a> in computer science. Throughout the book, he demonstrates how his causal methods can be applied to many diverse fields of research, but it's clear that what excites him the most is its potential in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>What is causal inference? When we perform scientific studies, we're often interested in the relationship between variables (treatments, risk factors, diseases, outcomes). Scientific studies that investigate these relationships can be divided into two types: observational and interventional. Observational studies can identify associations, but they cannot tell you anything about the direction of that association. There may be other variables that distort your results by concealing a true relationship, or worse, by generating false ones. That's why researchers turn to interventional studies as a more reliable source of evidence—specifically, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The problem is, RCTs are not always ethical or feasible, and they require more resources to set up and run. Enter the exciting field of causal inference, which aims to answer questions about cause and effect from observational data.</p>
<p>A brief word on what causal inference is <em>not</em>—this is something that took me a while to wrap my head around. Causal inference doesn't tell us from scratch what the causes of an event are. Nor is it able to "prove" that one variable caused another. Those questions belong to the realm of causal <em>discovery</em>. Instead, causal inference aims to draw richer interpretations beyond mere associations from observational data. We can answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of these variables actually affect the outcome?</li>
<li>What is the magnitude of effect of each individual treatment variable on the outcome?</li>
<li>What are the mechanisms underlying a complex problem such as cancer?</li>
</ul>
<p>The catch is that, whether explicitly or implicitly, you must make
assumptions in the first place about the directions of causality among the variables. In many cases, the data can <em>support</em> your assumptions, but any
relationships you observe in the data without considering these prior
assumptions are purely correlation. And you know the drill,
<em>correlation is not causation</em>...</p>
<p>There are many approaches to causal inference, of which Pearl's is
characterised by two techniques: graphs (DAGs) and <em>do</em>-calculus. More
on that in a minute.</p>
<h2>Ladder of causation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Rung 1: Associations, observational data (seeing)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rung 2: Intervention (doing)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rung 3: Counterfactuals (imagining)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearl proposes this framework which we can use to categorise the various techniques of causal inference. At the bottom lies passive observation of a system,
allowing us to find direction-free associations. The next rung up is
intervention: by explicitly setting the values of treatment variables,
we abolish the effects of confounders. This is even more effective
with randomisation, which is why RCTs are hailed as the gold standard
of scientific studies.</p>
<p>Going beyond intervention is the idea of the counterfactual, or
<em>what-if</em> thinking. If this person had never smoked, would he
still have gotten lung cancer? Counterfactuals are subtly but
crucially different from interventions. These hypothetical questions
pertain to what might have been, and cannot actually happen in the real
world. We can intervene by stopping that person with lung cancer from
smoking now, but we can't erase that lung cancer patient's 50-year history of smoking, which is the counterfactual question we're asking in this
case. Think of counterfactuals as parallel universes. Counterfactuals strengthen the case for a causal relationship:
if <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> causes <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, then <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> shouldn't happen in the abscence of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Of
course, things are rarely this simple in real life, and the authors also discuss <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficienct</em> causes.</p>
<h2>DAGs</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> stands for "directed acyclic graph". A DAG is simply a diagram
containing nodes that are connected by edges (lines) with directions,
and tracing these edges according to their directions should not result in a closed loop. In causal analysis, DAGs are used to represent
the relationships between variables in a system, with the directed
edges indicating the (assumed) direction of causation.</p>
<p>Pearl is a vocal proponent of graphical models in causal
inference. DAGs, he argues, are much more intuitive than algrebraic
expressions in illustrating complex problems. Importantly, DAGs can
clearly tell us which variables should be controlled for and which
ones should be left as they are. Confounders (common causes) are commonly defined as variables that are associated with both the treatment variable and the outcome variable, and everyone knows we need to control for confounders. However, there are in fact other types of variables that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome that should <em>not</em> be controlled for. A common example is collider variables (common effects); controlling for a collider will create a spurious association between treatment and outcome, where there was previously none. DAGs are
invaluable in highlighting these potential pitfalls as our models get
more complex.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/clinjasn/12/3/546/F3.large.jpg">here</a> for graphical representations of confounders, mediators, and colliders.</p>
<h2><em>do</em>-calculus</h2>
<p><em>do</em>-calculus is the other pillar of Pearl's approach to causal
inference, refined over the years by his students. I have to admit
that this entire topic has flown right over my head, and the authors don't
make it easy to follow in the book. Reading about how <em>do</em>-calculus
was derived and how it may be used felt a lot like "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">How to Draw An
Owl"</a> material.</p>
<p>At a high level, <em>do</em>-calculus is basically a formalised, mathematical
way of expressing interventions in contrast to observations. Conditional probabilities contain no information about causality. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>∣</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(A \mid B)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> represents the probability of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <em>observed</em>, a concept that lies at the bottom rung of Pearl's Ladder of Causation. To show the probability of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when you cause <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to happen in an experiment, you would write <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>∣</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P[A \mid do(B)]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead. When you're able to manipulate a treatment variable statistically, you can also delete arrows pointing towards it in a DAG, which may reveal new confounders, colliders, and mediators. Using <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/350267/a-layman-understanding-of-the-difference-between-back-door-and-front-door-adjust">front-door adjustment</a>, we can also control for <em>unobserved</em> confounders, which is pretty darn nifty.</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>As its subtitle suggests, <em>The Book of Why</em> is ambitious in scope and
touches upon a dizzying array of seminal ideas from the 19th and 20th
century. These are the main topics covered in each chapter (paraphrased by me to be more informative; not actual titles).</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: Pearl's Ladder of Causation</li>
<li>Chapter 2: Sewall Wright and path analysis, a major
influence on Pearl</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Bayes' theorem and Pearl's work on Bayesian
networks</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Confounders, mediators, colliders, and back-door adjustment</li>
<li>Chapter 5: How causal inference could have resolved the
smoking-and-cancer debate</li>
<li>Chapter 6: Causal inference applied to statistical paradoxes
(Monty Hall problem, Simpson's paradox, Berkson's paradox, Lord's
paradox)</li>
<li>Chapter 7: <em>do</em>-calculus, front-door adjustment, and instrumental variables</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Counterfactuals, potential outcomes, and structural
equation modelling</li>
<li>Chapter 9: Mediation analysis</li>
<li>Chapter 10: The role of causal inference in Big Data and AI</li>
</ul>
<h2>My thoughts on <em>The Book of Why</em></h2>
<p>Let's start with the obvious. This book dwells on the history of statistics a lot, and statisticians, as the authors would have you believe, are zealots who have conspired to keep causal thinking out of their field right from the start. That is, until Pearl instigated the "Causal Revolution", as he dubs it, the latest and greatest gift to modern science. I have no dog in this fight, but Pearl (whom I assume is the source of most of these opinions put to paper by Mackenzie) often comes across as wildly biased and grandiose. For what it's worth, I doubt that statisticians as a whole are anywhere as malicious or ignorant as they're portrayed in this book.</p>
<p>I'm confused about the intended audience. This book is
simultaneously too simplistic for experts and too technical for
lay people (i.e. me). I suspect the ideal reader lies somewhere in between: someone with a solid grasp of basic statistics and maths who is interested in causal analysis. The authors' contempt and mischaracterisations of the entire field of statistics are unlikely to sit well with said reader, though.</p>
<p>There are many minor errors in the edition I have, including some
inexplicably basic ones that conflate odds and probability, but <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/errata-pages-PearlMackenzie_BookofWhy_Final.pdf">this
PDF</a> contains the errata.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with what I got out of this book, I
think. While
Pearl's opinion of statistics and of his own work are on extreme ends of a
spectrum, and similarly irksome, there is much to celebrate in
this strange tome. I really appreciate the breadth of topics and historical anecdotes that feature here, sprinkled with a healthy dash of philosophy. I'm also very intrigued about the applications of causal inference in biomedical research, and this book has led me to the opening of many tantalising rabbit holes. However, I strongly recommend reading Pearl's technical overview instead (link below), which is very similar to <em>The Book of Why</em>, but more concise and palatable.</p>

              <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I found an unsecure webcam online, and called the guy to turn it off, and he did.</p>

<p>I was watching Zack Freedman on YouTube, an up and coming hardware hacker. He mentioned Shodan, which apparently is a directory of devices accessible via internet. They include industrial controllers, webcams, databases, and video games, purportedly. I checked it out and couldn't find any live streams, which reminded me of a site I have visited before insecam.org. So I went there and I browsed around a bit and found a stream of a man sitting as his computer in what the webcam labeled "OFFICE". </p>
<p>Before I came across this stream, I saw other streams with people. For example, I saw a stream of a casino in San Diego where some people were at slot machines. In another, I saw a man setting up what the webcam labeled "Big Grow Tent" in Arizona, which he eventually panned over to marijuana growing inside one of those highly reflective plastic lined grow tents. I saw another stream where people were eating outside at what seemed to be a resort in Colorado under partial construction. These were all in public places though where the Supreme Court would say they cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy. So it felt ok. Sort of like people watching in a park, except they're 500-1000 miles away and can't see you. But anyways, continuining on.</p>
<p>With the stream of the man in the "OFFICE" it didn't really seem like an office. There was a 3D printer and another desk with a blanket across the chair, which was probably most likely this man's significant other. This didn't exactly seem like an office of a business. It irked me that this guy, who was probably just browsing the internet, could be surveilled by some complete stranger hundreds of miles away from him, in what seemed to be his home office. So I ended up basically doxxing this guy. I was able to figure out his name by visiting port 80 of the IP address from the camera stream. On that page, there was a link to a domain that was the man's full name dot com. So from there I was off to the races basically just using Whitepages and the like to get a phone number to call the guy. After a couple of these websites, I called the number that it listed.</p>
<p><img src="https://zbellay.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/images/posts/d4g.png"></p><p>The weirdest part was watching him pick up the phone as I called to inform him that his office webcam was completely exposed to the public. I think he was a little shocked and probably scared, so the conversation was awkward and breif, but I watched him disable the live stream, which is no longer accessible. A few minutes later he texted me asking me how I knew all this, and I gave him all of the relevant information. </p>

<p>There are a few takeaways from this experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't put webcams in your home. Just don't.</li>
<li>IoT and the like continue to prove to threaten the privacy of people. Even if you're technically savvy. The guy in this story had a 3D printer in his office, which I would argue is technically savvier than most people. </li>
<li>There is tons of information about us online. I found this guy's cell # and address via all publically accessible online resources. This is scary.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel conflicted about this experience. Because in order to preserve this man's privacy, I had to invade it further via probing into his identity. Ultimately, the ends probably justify the means, but still, I would feel pretty scared if I got a phone call out of the blue while I was watching YouTube videos that I was being watched.</p>

<time datetime="2021-03-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Mar 2021</time>
<h2 id="pretext">Pretext</h2>
<p>This is a story partially about laziness but the weird kind of laziness where, instead of doing <em>the thing</em>, you decide to do something completely different and more convoluted that ends up taking way more time because you can’t be bothered to do the thing.</p>
<p>In this instance, <em>the thing</em> is fixing my fridge (though I would argue it shouldn’t be my responsibility to do that, I rent and my landlord should have fixed this when it became an issue months ago but oh well).</p>
<h2 id="my-fridge-is-broken">My Fridge is Broken</h2>
<p>My fridge, being manufactured in 2003, is old enough to vote.</p>
<p>I learned that my fridge was broken by opening the attached freezer on top and looking at a puddle in my ice bin. While this was a useful signal to notice something was wrong with my fridge, I didn’t know what was wrong or how I could fix it. Chatting with my landlord, he mentioned “the previous tenant had a similar issue and whenever it happened, they would cut power to the fridge and wait about 15 minutes and then turn it back on”.</p>
<p>For context, the freezer and fridge share a compressor in models like this:
<img src="https://blog.ericv.me/public/images/2021-03-07/fridge.jpg" alt="My fridge/freezer combo unit with the freezer taking up about 1/3 of the unit's space. It sits atop the fridge portion."></p>
<p>Well, at least now I had a remediation step to take, so I gave it a shot and don’t you know, it worked perfectly! Problem solved! …Not really though, unless I want to be checking on my ice bin hourly to know if I needed to power cycle it, I needed another solution.</p>
<p>At this point a normal person might consider trying to repair the fridge or hiring someone to do as much, but it’s been over a month since the fridge technician made his house call and there has been no follow-up while the issue persists. So I hopped on amazon and started to solve the problem the only way I know how: with metrics and automated remediation!</p>
<h2 id="the-metric">The Metric</h2>
<p>For this problem, there are several metrics we could consider. Initially, my metric was looking in the ice bin to see if it was melting (if it was, this would lead to it all refreezing once the compressor started up again turning my cubes into a giant chunk of ice). While this metric works well for me (a human) it also catches the problem too late (the ice has already begun to melt meaning the freezer is over 32F) and it is harder to measure with a computer (maybe a trained computer vision model could learn to see melting ice differently from non-melting ice but that’s a bit more than I signed up for).</p>
<p>The solution I settled upon was to monitor the temperature inside the freezer with a bluetooth thermometer probe (though another way could be something like monitoring power draw at the wall of the fridge).</p>
<p>I picked up the cheap bluetooth thermometer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08S3CGZ3Q">here</a> for around $15 and set to work installing the app and checking it regularly. This let me observe temperatures that the freezer oscillates between during normal operation and what it looks like when the temperature begins to run away:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ericv.me/public/images/2021-03-07/fridge_temps.png" alt="Fridge temperature graph showing oscillations between 2.5F and 12F excepting one large spike to around 28F. Oscillations appear to occur every hour or so"></p>
<p>As you can see, the temperature sits somewhere from 2.5F to 12F regularly and occasionally spikes during weird events. Clearly in the image shown the spike was halted by the system I’m about to build in this blog.</p>
<p>So we have a metric and graph viewable in an app. Let’s grab some random FOSS project that can talk to these weird thermometers over bluetooth and slap it in a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-data">Gathering Data</h2>
<p>To interface with the thermometer, instead of using the weird limited app I wondered if someone else had taken a crack at talking to this device directly and it turns out they did! I found a project called <a href="https://github.com/tobievii/inkbird">Inkbird</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericvolp12/inkbird">forked it</a> to twist to my nefarious purposes of making my fridge smart.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this is a node.js project that utilizes the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abandonware/noble">noble</a> BLE module to talk to Inkbird thermometers. Though this code was written for a previous version, so I had to modify one of the constants to scan BLE devices and filter for the correct device name.</p>
<p>I found the right name through experimenting with a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-bluetooth-app/id1054362403">bluetooth scanning app</a> on my phone and opening and closing the freezer door to see which device jumped in signal when it opened.</p>
<p>I wrote a loop that connects to the thermometer once a minute to avoid killing its battery prematurely. It grabs one datapoint containing a temperature and battery level reading and then disconnects. It then exposes the program state via a JSON API endpoint with Express.</p>
<p>An abbreviated form of the final product can be found below:</p>

<h2 id="metric-monitoring-and-heuristics">Metric Monitoring and Heuristics</h2>
<p>This code as written will build a running log of the past 60 minutes of one-per-minute measurements of freezer temperature, and track the current battery life of the sensor.</p>
<p>To enhance it we want to add some kind of heuristic to determine if the freezer is too warm.</p>
<p>We can do that by setting a trigger temperature and then a number of minutes the freezer must be above that temperature to trigger the alarm. We also want to add an alarm cooldown so we don’t trigger once a minute while the freezer temp is rising. Since even if we kick in remediation it can take some time to drop the temps back down.</p>
<p>So we’ll add these variables to <code>state</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>//...</span>
    <span>triggerTemp</span><span>:</span> <span>20</span><span>,</span>
    <span>triggerMinutes</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
    <span>lastPowerReset</span><span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>cooldownMin</span><span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>,</span>
    <span>powerCycleWaitTime</span><span>:</span> <span>15</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Nice, now we want to add the heuristic to our loop by grabbing the last <code>triggerMinutes</code> worth of measurements from <code>sensorState.temps</code> and checking if all of them are over the <code>triggerTemp</code>.</p>

  <span>}</span>
  <span>//...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Finally, we need to somehow remediate the problem.</p>

<p>We know that powering the fridge off and waiting about 15 minutes and turning it back on seems to remediate the issue. Do I know why that works? No. Do I need to know in order to fix it? Also no. But we can simply automate the power cycling to make this problem fix itself. All I need to do is power off the fridge, wait 15 minutes, and turn it on, but from code.</p>
<p>As a bit of background I wrote this <a href="https://github.com/ericvolp12/gohome">home automation API in Go</a> a couple months ago which talks to Philips Hue, Belkin WeMo, and Tasmota IOT devices through different protocols and gives me the ability to control them at will and with automation. The interesting bits for this project are the <code>SetStateHandler</code> which can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericvolp12/gohome/blob/master/cmd/gohome/main.go#L141">here</a>.</p>
<p>This code allows me to set the power state of a given <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/">Tasmota</a> outlet connected to a MQTT broker in my apartment. I hacked up some old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079MFTYMV">Gosund ESP8266 based WiFi Smart Plugs</a> and installed Tasmota on them with the aid of <a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert">TuyaConvert</a> which allows you to OverTheAir upgrade some off-the-shelf IOT devices. It is worth knowing that some of the recent Gosund units I’ve bought from Amazon have updated firmware that is harder to flash and until recently I wasn’t able to update them until the TuyaConvert project managed to crack some of their newer security features for OTA updates.</p>
<p>So we have an API in my home that allows me to talk to an outlet and make it turn on and off, so the last thing to do is integrate it into the temperature tracking code.</p>
<p>We’ll use Axios to make a JSON POST request to the API as required.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>axios</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>axios</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>setFridgeState</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>desiredState</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>powerState</span><span>:</span> <span>desiredState</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>logger_</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span>
        <span>`Successfully set fridge to state (</span><span>${</span><span>desiredState</span><span>}</span><span>): `</span><span>,</span>

    <span>});</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we can invoke the <code>setFridgeState</code> function from our heuristic code to turn off the fridge and use the <code>powerCycleWaitTime</code> variable to tell it how long to wait before turning the fridge back on.</p>

<p>After years running a CI company, you see lots of hidden costs in architectural decisions. In this article I'd like to talk a bit about the practical differences between serverless and its primary alternative, microservice (containerized) architecture.</p><h2 id="introduction-to-architectures-serverless-and-containers-cdn">Introduction to architectures: Serverless and Containers + CDN</h2><p>The vast majority of back end architectures for new products we've seen built in the past couple of years have fallen one of these two buckets.</p><h3 id="serverless">Serverless</h3><p>The core idea for serverless is to specify a strategy for creating new webservers, instead of starting them yourself. That way if your product is featured somewhere and gets a huge burst of traffic, your cloud provider can start many copies of the webserver, and turn them off as the traffic subsides.</p><figure><img src="https://layerci.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/lambdas.svg"><figcaption>Serverless is often used interchangably with its AWS brand name, Lambda.</figcaption></figure><p>Serverless still uses webservers eventually, of course. The point is just that you don't have to create them yourself. All you do is specify the recipe for building them, and your cloud provider will create more copies as the number of concurrent requests goes up or down. Even for small projects with few users, you'll save money by turning off every single webserver overnight while nobody is visiting your site.</p><h3 id="containers-cdn">Containers + CDN</h3><p>Instead of specifying a recipe to create your webservers (Serverless style), you could offload the most computationally expensive parts of hosting your website to someone else. That's the idea for a CDN. When a webserver slows down, it's often from hundreds of requests asking for the same resource that hasn't changed. The CDN takes care of these common requests like static images for you.</p><figure><img src="https://layerci.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/cdncontainers-1.svg"><figcaption>Containers (left) and CDN (middle) process hundreds of requests from users</figcaption></figure><p>In this architecture, users to your website will request the resource from the CDN, which will respond to most (~90%) of the requests. Only the requests that can't obviously be cached are forwarded to your containers.</p><h3 id="recap-serverless-vs-containers">Recap: Serverless vs Containers</h3><ul><li>Serverless "webservers" are really recipes for how to create real webservers, and your cloud provider will start one when a visitor first requests something.</li><li>Containers are usually much slower to start, so you need to keep at least one running 24/7 in case someone requests something from your site.</li></ul><h2 id="serverless-looks-inexpensive-in-theory">Serverless looks inexpensive in theory</h2><p>When AWS Lambda was launched in 2014, it sounded like an incredible deal: 1GB of memory for $0.0000000167/ms of computation. A typical API request might be 20ms, so you'd be paying $0.000000334/request.</p><p>Since most workloads are very "bursty", you'll likely be paying under $100/yr for even a popular service being hosted behind lambdas.</p><p>For comparison, a comparable Containers + CDN architecture would likely cost over $500/yr for most products.</p><p>Of course, this is an extremely simplified comparison (elastic load balancing, CDN ingress/egress, serverless can use a CDN too, ...) but will generally hold true for a majority of products online today. Serverless webservers will cost 10-20% as much as comparable containers, with all else held equal.</p><p>Infrastructure cost is a nice metric - it's somewhat easy to predict, it's a convenient way to compare a "good architecture" with a "bad architecture."</p><p>However, infrastructure cost is completely dwarfed by developer salaries. That $500/yr container will be maintained by a developer being paid (on average) $75,000/yr.</p><p>As I mentioned in the title of this cost, the human cost is something I've personally seen a lot of companies underestimate. If you have a bug which can't be reproduced locally (most meaningful ones), developers using a closed-source AWS account will have enormous difficulty reproducing and triaging it.</p><h3 id="three-factors-that-combine-to-make-developing-with-serverless-exceptionally-difficult-">Three factors that combine to make developing with serverless exceptionally difficult.</h3><ol><li><strong>You can't emulate serverless instances locally</strong>, only in the cloud</li><li><strong>Very few companies can create copies of their production infrastructure.</strong> It often takes hours for developers to requisition the proper environment and ensure that nobody else is using it concurrently.</li><li><strong>Developers rarely have access to production resources</strong>, so they can't debug in production without spending hours negotiating a pair programming session.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://layerci.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/stagingfight.png"><figcaption>A common scene in engineering slack channels the world over</figcaption></figure><p>If a single developer fixes one bug per week, and takes an hour longer to fix each bug because of the factors above, your company will be paying <strong>$1,872 per year for a single developer's productivity loss.</strong> That number is already <strong>4x the difference in cost to begin with.</strong></p><p>In contrast, a container architecture might entirely run on a developer's computer (which is the case for LayerCI's infrastructure) so that same developer would likely be able to reproduce a bug on their own laptop without having to use a staging environment in the first place.</p><h2 id="another-cost-more-bugs-make-it-to-customers-with-serverless">Another cost: More bugs make it to customers with serverless</h2><p>For similar reasons to the previous point, it's significantly harder to automatically test a serverless architecture with a CI/CD system.</p><p><strong>A containerized architecture is significantly easier to test because you can run it within a single VM</strong>. A serverless architecture would require a new deployment within your cloud provider for every change in order to run CI.</p><figure><img src="https://layerci.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/layerinlayer.png"><figcaption>LayerCI's own tests involve starting many fresh copies of all of our containers, which takes about five minutes because we're using a containerized architecture and can share container images across runs</figcaption></figure><p>The ultimate test of a system are end-to-end (E2E) tests which validate common workflows by creating a fake user and interacting with the entire app like a real user would. These tests can only be run automatically against a proposed change if it's possible to create copies of your architecture as needed.</p><p>In many companies, a single bug in a demo could mean losing a 6-7 digit sale. These bugs are often the result of seemingly innocuous changes that affect the interactions of different components. <strong>It's very easy for a developer to break the "pay now" button or the onboarding</strong> if they aren't testing that those flows continue work after every change.</p><p>If your entire stack can be run on a single machine, it can be run in turnkey CI providers without too much trouble. In comparison, a serverless stack might require creating an entire environment within your cloud provider from scratch for every change, which would take 10x longer.</p><h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2><p>The obvious solution for serverless would be for providers to adapt a common standard (AWS <a href="https://kubeless.io/">kubeless</a> or AWS <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFAAS</a>.) As long as serverless is eponymous with closed-source cloud offerings, it will cost dramatically more because of lost developer productivity.</p><p>Really, the best solution currently is to avoid platforms like AWS Lambda or Cloudflare Workers for core infrastructure altogether until it's possible to self-host them for reproduction and testing.</p><p>For almost every architectural decision, hosting cost is significantly less important than the cost of developers moving slower. Don't make architectural decisions because of price until you consider the cost of time for the developers that need to work with that infrastructure.</p><p>Discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26378674">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://dev.to/colinchartier/serverless-is-more-expensive-than-you-d-expect-30o1">dev.to</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lzxbwp/serverless_is_more_expensive_than_youd_expect/">reddit</a></p>

    <p>
I have seen claims that the von Neumann Morgenstern utility theorem (vNM) grounding Expected Utility Theory (EUT) voids <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ergodicity Economics</a> (EE) and time averages, including appeals to authority about von Neumann being an expert on the idea of (non)ergodicity. I think that misses a subtlety; in what follows I have tried to avoid any use of "right" or "wrong", instead trying to emphasize the <i>"usefulness"</i> of modeling assumptions given the situation.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">vNM theorem</a> guarantees the existence of a utility function IFF four axioms (termed {completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence}) are satisfied. Quite reasonable on the face of it, but the theorem implicitly assumes the existence of a probability distribution, and <i>doesn't say anything about where the probabilities come from</i>. That choice is a separate <b>modeling assumption</b> when applying the vNM framework to a specific situation, and presumably <i>a crucial implicit assumption underlying EUT</i>, as commonly used.
</p>

<p>
Consider the simple experiment of repeated tosses of a fair coin, increasing or decreasing the agent's wealth by \(10\%\) on each turn<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion">Geometric Brownian motion</a> (without the drift, for simplicity). <i>What probability distribution over the set of trajectories is appropriate to capture the agent's behavior?</i> Note that vNM has nothing to say about this – leaving it up to the modeler to choose judiciously. That choice implicitly decides between time and ensemble averages (or whatever else kind of average).
</p>

<p>
If we expect this game to be played a small number of times compared with the number of trajectories (eg: a billion \(\approx 2^{30} \gg 2^{100}\), for 100 sequential coin tosses), then the distribution of <i>"typical"</i> trajectories <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure"><i>concentrates</i></a> around the median case (expected number of H and T) with probability approaching one, leaving the agent almost no chance to probe the extreme scenarios (long strings of H or long strings of T). This concentrated measure which describes how the (available "small" number of) agents/plays will "probe" the trajectories and leads to what we call "time averages"<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> is very different from the distribution corresponding to ensemble probabilities of trajectories, where each trajectory is equally likely (for a fair coin).
</p>

<p>
The only way to realize a situation which circumvents this concentration of measure is to live in the regime where the number of (parallel) plays far exceeds the number of trajectories. In such a scenario, it will turn out that the distribution probed by the ensemble of agents/plays corresponds to what we call the "ensemble average"<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> among the trajectories.
</p>

<p>
To be even more thorough, we care about the probability distribution not in the space of trajectories, but the induced distribution on the observable (i.e. the space of payoffs) – which is the quantity we are actually averaging. These two distributions could look very different eg. in cases where a small set of trajectories in the ensemble have outsized (exponentially large) payoffs! IFF we happen to be in the latter situation (depending on the observable/payoff, and the process) we may call the {observable, process} combination  <i>"ergodic"</i>.
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="ergodicity-and-economic-modeling"><span>1</span> Ergodicity and economic modeling</h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
EE is not in opposition with the vNM framework! Rather, <i>the point of EE is that one can avoid performing complicated gymnastics with utilities/payoffs to model behavior, if one is instead more judicious about the probabilities multiplying them</i>. That is the role played by time averages instead of ensemble averages.
</p>

<p>
If one were only interested in modeling a single problem, the prescription of distribution is about as much input as a prescription of utilities – they both beg the question equally, in a sense. The true value of EE comes from its potential <i>generalizability to modeling multiple problems with the same prescription of averaging</i> if it turns out that the prescription of time averages is sufficient to correctly model behaviour using simple/obvious utility functions, rather than cooking up a different utility function to model the behavior in each problem.
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="ergodicity-and-physical-systems"><span>2</span> Ergodicity and physical systems</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
We have all the pieces in place to understand the roots of ergodicity in physical systems, so we might as well touch on that. (This section is a digression from the economics discussion, and can be safely skipped by readers primarily interested in that.)
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis">ergodic hypothesis</a> claims that (even) a single agent (i.e. a physical system in a given macrostate) will (over a reasonable time scale) uniformly explore the microstates in the ensemble corresponding to the macrostate (through natural dynamics).
The only observables that can be probed by experiments on a single system (or a few systems) are time averages, but the ergodic hypothesis allows those to be equated with ensemble averages (which are far easier to compute). For this replacement to be a useful model (at least in non-pathological systems), we don't really need the system's trajectory to probe <i>all</i> the microstates, but merely to probe the phase space volume densely<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> and uniformly. Loosely speaking, chaotic dynamics can induce a dense sampling, while Liouville's theorem guarantees uniformity along the trajectory. There are caveats to that statement, whose subtleties I haven't fully mapped out yet; suffice to say that there are interesting examples where this doesn't trivially happen, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Pasta%E2%80%93Ulam%E2%80%93Tsingou_problem">Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem</a> or <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Glassy_dynamics">glassy dynamics</a>.

		<p>If you are familiar with Android, you have probably noticed that there are <strong>a lot</strong> of preinstalled apps.<br>
In some cases, these are added by smartphone vendor, while in others, they come from the phone carrier. But those you don’t use clutter the system as they are non-removable without special privileges. Worse, they can drain your battery in background &amp; <a href="https://haystack.mobi/papers/preinstalledAndroidSW_preprint.pdf?utm_source=JeromeVosgienFR&amp;utm_medium=SophosFranceLink">spy on you</a>. They are commonly called <strong>‘Bloatware’</strong>.<br>
At iodé, we have selected a set of open-source preinstalled apps for common use. We now go one step further as we have added the possibility for you to easily <strong>uninstall</strong> and <strong>reinstall</strong> them!</p>

March 7, 2021 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/mmio-in-zig/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/mmio-in-zig/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">Kevin Lynagh</a> and I spent some time playing around with <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> on <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fstruct_nrf52%2Fstruct%2nRF52.html">nrf52</a> boards. He's written about the experience <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/">here</a>. I wanted to additionally highlight the api we used for memory-mapped IO registers because it shows off some nice features of zig. </p>
<p>An MMIO register is just an address in memory where reads and writes are interpreted specially by the hardware. For example, on the nRF52833 board writing the value 0b11 to address 0x708 will set the 3rd GPIO pin to output mode and disconnect the input buffer. </p>
<p>The list of available registers is documented in a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF52833_PS_v1.3.pdf">massive pdf</a> for each board. The same information also exists in an accompanying xml file which we can use to generate a nice typed api. So the question is what do we want the api to look like? </p>
<p>Fundamentally, an MMIO register is just a pointer to some specific address in memory:</p>
<pre><code><span>const Register = struct {
    raw_ptr: *u32,
    
    pub fn init(address: usize) Register {
        return Register{ .raw_ptr = @intToPtr(*u32, address) };
    }
    
    pub fn read_raw(self: Register) u32 {
        return self.raw_ptr.*;
    }
    
    pub fn write_raw(self: Register, value: u32) void {
        self.raw_ptr.* = value;
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>It's important though that all reads and writes to the pointer happen in a single instruction so that the hardware doesn't see half a write. We also have to be careful that reads and writes are never optimized away by the compiler because it thinks that they don't affect the rest of the program. We can guarantee both of these with the <code>volatile</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code><span>const Register = struct {
    raw_ptr: *volatile u32,
    
    pub fn init(address: usize) Register {
        return Register{ .raw_ptr = @intToPtr(*volatile u32, address) };
    }
    
    pub fn read_raw(self: Register) u32 {
        return self.raw_ptr.*;
    }
    
    pub fn write_raw(self: Register, value: u32) void {
        self.raw_ptr.* = value;
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The values in these registers are often interpreted as packed bitfields:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/38b31162390e7e83cf737044a5536626dd29354c/4c327/writing/mmio-in-zig/pin_cnf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Zig can represent these kinds of bitfields directly:</p>
<pre><code><span>const pin_cnf_val = packed struct {
    dir: packed enum(u1) {
        input = 0,
        output = 1,
    } = .input,
    input: packed enum(u1) {
        connect = 0,
        disconnect = 1,
    } = .disconnect,
    pull: packed enum(u2) {
        disabled = 0,
        pulldown = 1,
        pullup = 3,
    } = .disabled,
    _unused4: u4 = 0,
    drive: packed enum(u3) {
        s0s1 = 0,
        h0s1 = 1,
        s0h1 = 2,
        h0h1 = 3,
        d0s1 = 4,
        d0h1 = 5,
        s0d1 = 6,
        h0d1 = 7,
    } = .s0s1,
    _unused11: u5 = 0,
    sense: packed enum(u2) {
        disabled = 0,
        high = 2,
        low = 3,
    } = .disabled,
    _unused18: u14 = 0,
};
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are a whole bunch of features on show here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fields of a <code>packed struct</code> are always laid out in memory in the order they are written, with no padding.</li>
<li><code>u3</code> is a 3-bit unsigned integer.</li>
<li>A <code>packed enum(u3)</code> is an enum stored as a 3-bit unsigned integer.</li>
<li>Zig types can be used anonymously, so we don't need to name the various enums here if we don't want to.</li>
<li>Struct fields can be given default values eg <code>input = .disconnect</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can check that this layout is correct at compile time:</p>
<pre><code><span>comptime {
    assert(@bitSizeOf(pin_cnf_val) == @bitSizeOf(u32));
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We could just make the struct field be <code>raw_ptr: *volatile pin_cnf_val</code> but this won't work for all registers - some registers have different interpretations depending on whether you are reading or writing, so we need different types for reading and writing.</p>
<p>We can handle this by writing a function that takes the read type and the write type as arguments, and returns a type describing the register: </p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn Register(comptime Read: type, comptime Write: type) type {
    return struct {
        raw_ptr: *volatile u32,
        
        // The type being returned inside this function doesn't have a name yet when it's being created
        // so we have to refer to it using `@This()`
        const Self = @This();
        
        pub fn init(address: usize) Self { ... }
        pub fn read_raw(self: Self) u32 { ... }
        pub fn write_raw(self: Self, value: u32) void { ... }
        
        pub fn read(self: Self) Read {
            return @bitCast(Read, self.raw_ptr.*);
        }
        
        pub fn write(self: Self, value: Write) void {
            self.raw_ptr.* = @bitCast(u32, value);
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is how generics work in zig!</p>
<p>Here's the earlier example rewritten with this nice new api:</p>
<pre><code><span>const pin_cnf_2 = Register(pin_cnf_val, pin_cnf_val).init(0x708);
pin_cnf_2.write(.{
    .dir = .output,
    .input = .disconnect,
});
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>.{ ... }</code> is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Anonymous-Struct-Literals">anonymous struct</a> and the <code>.output</code> and <code>.disconnect</code> are <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Enum-Literals">anonymous enums</a>. These have their own unique type, but are coercible to any struct/enum with the same structure. This means the user of our api doesn't have to import any of these types or even remember their names.</p>
<p>Here is the generated code:</p>
<pre><code><span>000100e4 &lt;__unnamed_1&gt;:
   100e4:	00000003 	andeq	r0, r0, r3

000200e8 &lt;_start&gt;:
   200e8:	f240 00e4 	movw	r0, #228	; 0xe4
   200ec:	f2c0 0001 	movt	r0, #1
   200f0:	6800      	ldr	r0, [r0, #0]
   200f2:	f44f 61e1 	mov.w	r1, #1800	; 0x708
   200f6:	6008      	str	r0, [r1, #0]
   200f8:	4770      	bx	lr
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure why it loads the <code>3</code> from a constant section instead of just writing it directly to <code>r0</code>. But we can at least see that the <code>str</code> is a single instruction, as desired.</p>
<p>It's pretty common to want to read a value from a register, modify some fields and then write it back. So let's add a method to do that:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn Register(comptime Read: type, comptime Write: type) type {
    return struct {
        ...
        
        pub fn modify(self: Self, new_value: anytype) void {
            if (Read != Write) {
                @compileError("Can't modify because read and write types for this register aren't the same.");
            }
            var old_value = self.read();
            const info = @typeInfo(@TypeOf(new_value));
            inline for (info.Struct.fields) |field| {
                @field(old_value, field.name) = @field(new_value, field.name);
            }
            self.write(old_value);
        }
    };
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>It's used very similarly to the <code>write</code> method:</p>
<pre><code><span>pin_cnf_2.modify(.{
    .dir = .output,
    .input = .disconnect,
});
</span></code></pre>
<p>The only difference is that instead of assigning default values to fields that aren't mentioned, it uses the values that are currently in the register.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in the implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the read and write types aren't the same then this function doesn't make sense. We check at compile time and emit a nice error message with a call stack if the types don't match.</li>
<li><code>@typeInfo</code> returns a data structure containing information about a type. We can use this to check what fields are mentioned in the anonymous struct type. </li>
<li>The type info is known at compile time, so we can use <code>inline for</code> to unroll a loop over the list of fields.</li>
<li><code>@field(foo, "bar")</code> means the same as <code>foo.bar</code>, allowing us to refer to fields with a string name that is known at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the metaprogramming is compiled away, leaving us with:</p>
<pre><code><span>000200e4 &lt;_start&gt;:
   200e4:	b082      	sub	sp, #8
   200e6:	f44f 60e1 	mov.w	r0, #1800	; 0x708
   200ea:	6801      	ldr	r1, [r0, #0]
   200ec:	0a0a      	lsrs	r2, r1, #8
   200ee:	f8ad 2000 	strh.w	r2, [sp]
   200f2:	0e0a      	lsrs	r2, r1, #24
   200f4:	f041 0103 	orr.w	r1, r1, #3
   200f8:	f88d 2002 	strb.w	r2, [sp, #2]
   200fc:	f88d 1007 	strb.w	r1, [sp, #7]
   20100:	f89d 1007 	ldrb.w	r1, [sp, #7]
   20104:	f240 720b 	movw	r2, #1803	; 0x70b
   20108:	7001      	strb	r1, [r0, #0]
   2010a:	f8bd 0000 	ldrh.w	r0, [sp]
   2010e:	f89d 1002 	ldrb.w	r1, [sp, #2]
   20112:	7011      	strb	r1, [r2, #0]
   20114:	f240 7109 	movw	r1, #1801	; 0x709
   20118:	8008      	strh	r0, [r1, #0]
   2011a:	b002      	add	sp, #8
   2011c:	4770      	bx	lr
</span></code></pre>
<p>More bitshifting than I would have liked to see in the final code, but there's certainly no leftover metaprogramming.</p>
<p>This isn't a sufficiently-smart-compiler thing either. The rules for what is evaluated at compile-time are pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>function arguments prefixed with <code>comptime</code> must be known at compile time at the callsite</li>
<li>blocks wrapped in <code>comptime { ... }</code> are evaluated at comptime</li>
<li>if the argument to <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code> doesn't refer to any variables not known at compile time, the correct branch is inlined</li>
<li>the argument to <code>inline for</code> or <code>inline while</code> must be known at compile time and their body is unrolled</li>
<li>some builtin functions like <code>@field</code> require their arguments to be known at compile time</li>
</ul>
<p>After all of this compile-time evaluation and loop unrolling, the result is still statically type-checked. So if we typo a field name we get a reasonable error at compile time:</p>
<pre><code><span>./test.zig:39:17: error: no member named 'inpot' in struct 'pin_cnf_val'
                @field(old_value, field.name) = @field(new_value, field.name);
                ^
./test.zig:100:21: note: called from here
    pin_cnf_2.modify(.{
                    ^
./test.zig:98:25: note: called from here
export fn _start() void {
                        ^
</span></code></pre>
<p>This puts zig in an interesting spot in the space of language design. It can do the kinds of metaprogramming available in many dynamic languages - using the language itself rather than switching to a clunky type language. But we can easily guarantee that the metaprogramming is compiled away and the resulting code is statically type-checked. And the whole thing compiles to a single binary that doesn't even depend on libc - the stripped binary for the first example above is 872 bytes.</p>

</time><address data-uk-scrollspy="hidden: false; repeat: true; offset-top: -50">

</address><p>Final results show 64.4% of voters coming out against the planned law on Sunday.&nbsp;The rejection rate among the cantons ranged between 70.7% and 55.8%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At stake was the creation of the legal basis for a digital identity verification system, to be licenced and controlled by the state but provided mainly by private companies.</p><p>The single access point is aimed at simplifying the use of online services offered by commercial businesses as well as contact with public institutions via e-government channels.</p>
<p>“Mistrust in private companies was&nbsp;dominant and helped to tip the vote,”&nbsp;said political scientist Urs Bieri of the GfS Bern research institute on SRF public radio.</p><p>Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter acknowledged “a certain unease”&nbsp;among voters. She called on parliament and critics of the failed plan to now cooperate to avoid a standstill.</p><p>“We have no choice and must work towards a new solution, even if it takes several attempts,”&nbsp;she told a news conference. “It is key for Switzerland to catch up with other countries when it comes digitalisation.”</p><p>Daniel Graf of the referendum committee said voters had not come out against a digital identity scheme but only against the proposed solution. Green Party parliamentarian Sibel Arslan, who also opposed the law, said voters made it clear that they want an eID provided only by the&nbsp;government and under democratic control.</p><p>People's Party parliamentarian&nbsp;Franz Grüter, a supporter of the failed electronic identity scheme, said he was disappointed but is confident that a solution&nbsp;can be found for a new proposal.</p>
<h2>Civil society group</h2><p>The law at stake was approved by parliament in 2019 but then <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/data-security-issue-causes-concern-over-swiss-digital-id/46300224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged to a referendum</a>&nbsp;by an alliance of civil society groups, backed by trade unions as well as left-wing and some centrist parties.</p><p>The opponents argued the state should not be limited to acting as a licensing and oversight authority but that it should take full responsibility. The risk of data abuse by commercial providers would undermine the effort to make digitalisation more democratic, they say.</p><p>That said, the need for some form of an eID for the business community was not contested by opponents. Switzerland is lagging behind many European countries following unsuccessful attempts over the past decades to set up a single login system for users of online services.</p>
<h2>No capacity</h2><p>The government, which launched the bill three years ago, had said the proposed law sets the basis for a secure online login system.</p><p>During the campaign, Keller-Sutter praised the law as&nbsp;a compromise, sharing out the tasks between the state and the private sector.</p><p>Supporters of the law also pointed out that almost no government has the IT capacity and resources to single-handedly develop an eID quickly and to the appropriate standards.</p><p>A previous attempt to set up a public-private e-identity solution, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/orell-fuessli_swiss-passport-printer-meets-digital-id-challenge-head-on/45697922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuisseID</a>, failed more than ten years ago.</p><h2>Complex and Covid</h2><p>The relative complexity of the issue at stake made it challenging for citizens to form their opinion, said Lukas Golder, co-director of the GfS Bern research institute.</p><p>Doubts over the practical use of the eID and concerns about potential data abuse have been overwhelming, he said.</p>
<p>Several political scientists also pointed out that opposition to the law was a protest vote against the government and its anti-Covid policy.</p><p>Keller-Sutter said&nbsp;the current restrictions on public gatherings due to the pandemic had made campaigning and face-to-face meeting with voters more difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Public attention also appeared to focus more on the other issues up for vote on Sunday: a proposal to <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss--burka-ban--vote-too-close-to-call/46420534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban facial coverings, including the burka</a>, and to a lesser extent, a <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-direct-democracy-could-undo-a-free-trade-deal-with-indonesia/46422650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial free trade deal</a> between Switzerland and Indonesia, the world’s top producer of palm oil.</p><div role="region" aria-label="Infobox"><h2>Votes March 7, 2021</h2><p>Ban on facial covering/Burka:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51.2% yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48.8% no</p><p>Digital identification/eID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35.6% yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64.4% no</p><p>Free trade accord with Indonesia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51.6.% yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48.4% no</p><p>Turnout: 51.4%</p><p>About 5.5 million Swiss citizens, including registered expat Swiss, were eligible to take part in the votes.</p><p>There were also numerous ballots at cantonal and local levels on March 7.</p><p><span>End of insertion</span></p></div> </section>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>An interesting shift happens once you realise you’re writing code for humans to read, and not just for machines to execute.</p>

<p>One big change is that writing clearly takes priority over correct code.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Reading code involves building up a mental model of what each thing should do, and how these things interact with each other. The best code, however, short-circuits reading everything. Instead of reading the implementation, you use variable and function names, comments, and other clues to figure things out.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This is chunking. You combine things together, and remember them together. For example, a Chess Opening, like the Queen’s Gambit, is a chunk. So is a <code>forEach</code> loop: just by the name, you can figure out that it’s going to do something to every element of an array.</p>

<p>Once you’ve built a chunk for a <code>forEach</code> loop, you don’t have to read the implementation of <code>forEach</code> to understand what it will do. This is very powerful, since it allows you to come back to the code, without having to read the implementation of everything again.</p>

<p>Thus, a good name is a chunk that encodes important information about what the thing does.</p>

<p>We’re compressing information into the name. This is almost always a lossy compression. Further, the more lines to compress, the more losses you incur, since you want your names to be no longer than 80 characters.</p>

<p>The goal of good naming is to minimize this loss.</p>

<p>And naming things is hard because of this compression. English isn’t precise like C++, so compressing from a precise to an ambiguous language increases losses. Another big reason is that choosing the most important things to include is hard. You’ll notice that most disagreements about naming fall on these two axes: either the name isn’t just right for what you want to do (does it <code>assign</code> or <code>setup</code> or <code>link</code> or <code>mangle</code>?). Or the name doesn’t capture important parts of the functionality.</p>

<p>I think this is the generating function for most best practices I’ve heard of, and thus lots more valuable than one specific guidance.</p>

<h2 id="generating-best-practices">Generating best practices</h2>

<!-- Keep names short: big chunks are difficult chunks -->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make functions do one thing</p>

    <p>When a function does multiple things, the name needs to encode lots more information, like <code>link_user_to_trial_and_enable_downloads_and_set_charge_date()</code>. That’s a long name, and a sign of losing too much information: what semantics should the name expose about the charge date, and enabling downloads?</p>

    <p>These side effects are hard to encode for in the name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep functions small</p>

    <p>Long functions, like functions doing lots of things, need to encode lots of information into the name. And since the name length is bounded, you lose a lot more information in compressing this long name, which leads to poorer names.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid meaningless names</p>

    <p>Since we’re writing code to be read by humans, names that don’t compress any information don’t help us build chunks. This makes it harder to read, since you have to go down one layer of abstraction. You need to parse the implementation to understand what that piece of code does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid too abstract names</p>

    <p><code>do_things()</code> is a suitable name for any function, but the compression is too lossy to be useful - you lose almost all information, and need to parse the body to figure out what it does. Not great. It’s almost a meaningless name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be consistent</p>

    <p>When you build similar chunks throughout your code base, it becomes easier to go up another layer of abstraction, by chunking the chunks. For example, continuing the trial management system example, you’ll have 3 things in place:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><code>link_user_to_trial_agreement_given_email()</code></li>
      <li><code>enable_research_downloads_for_user()</code></li>
      <li><code>set_charge_date_for_user()</code></li>
    </ol>

    <p><br>
 Since they’re operating in the same domain, you can go up one level to <code>setup_user_for_trial()</code> that does all three.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="disrupting-best-practices">Disrupting best practices</h2>

<p>The generator of best practices allows you to reason about cases where best practices aren’t the best way forward.</p>

<p>For example, consider being consistent, and naming variables using camelCase. Your entire codebase uses camelCase. You’re writing a new function that’s very non-standard. It does arcane stuff that doesn’t fit into your existing model. You need it, because legacy integration/business requirements/etc. In effect, you don’t want anyone to gloss over it when they read it.</p>

<p>So, do you stay consistent, and keep it in camelCase? Or, do you switch to snake_case?</p>

<p>The goal is to keep things clear. I would switch to snake_case to show how it’s different from the rest, and have some comments explaining the arcane things it does.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="precision-with-words">Precision with words</h2>

<p>Spoken languages are very imprecise. There’s lots of ambiguity, double meanings, and sentences that don’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Code, however, needs to be precise. Like we saw above, this is a source of trouble, since we’re trying to compress a precise language into an imprecise one, which makes searching for the right English words harder.</p>

<p>These ideas apply to naming things outside of code, too! When you have a name for something, it suddenly becomes legible.</p>

<p>Consider: You see some people around you who test if they can do something once, and drop it if they fail. Some others keep trying until they learn how to do it. The first group prizes its intelligence, while the second group prizes its hard work. Then, when you hear about the <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/story-of-stories.html#the-story-of-growth-vs-fixed-mindset">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>, things immediately click.</p>

<p>Choosing the right name here is hard too. Every best practice that lost its nuance over time can be attributed to a name that didn’t encode the necessary information. People passed these ideas on without explaining the nuances.</p>

<p>Or, consider equating two names. “Abortion is murder” - equating two names that aren’t the same creates an interesting dynamic between emotions and the truth. Each name has different connotations, and on combining them together, you’re passing on the connotations of one onto the other. This isn’t necessarily a good thing. You have to be very careful of the equality operator in an imprecise language.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Optimise for clear, easy to understand code. The cost of reading it is higher than the cost of executing it.</p>

<p>To do this, leverage chunking: write names that are meaningful, and encode as much information as possible into the name.</p>

<p>However, writing meaningful names is a lossy compression. Every naming maxim follows from minimising this loss.</p>

<p>And finally, the same idea applies to naming things in the real world. Except, it’s even harder, since it’s encoding from an imprecise to another imprecise language. Code, atleast, was unambiguous in its execution.</p>

        <p><em>Hiâ€”Dan here. We're continuing Justin Mares's column on side businesses today! You can read previous editions </em><a href="https://every.to/@jwmares" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Before starting <a href="http://kettleandfire.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kettle &amp; Fire</a>, I had a previous life in the SaaS world. I ran growth for a team (Exceptional Cloud Services)&nbsp; that bought small SaaS apps and grew them. We later sold the bundle of businesses to Rackspace for 8 figures, in early 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>When I left Rackspace after the acquisition and went out on my own, I wanted to replicate the model weâ€™d seen so much success with at Exceptional. I wanted to buy and grow my own SaaS business.&nbsp;</p><p>My partner Ryan and I were on the lookout for a business that fulfilled one of the <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/the-four-kinds-of-side-hustles-2083436" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">side hustle criteria</a> Iâ€™ve written about before. A strong potential acquisition had to:</p><ul><li>Solve a problem someone is already aware of,</li><li>In a niche where customers are already paying,</li><li>Where the product <em>does not</em> require a lot of maintenance or hand-holding,</li><li>And is profitable or has a no-brainer path to profitability</li></ul><p>In early 2016, we stumbled across Notify: a simple Shopify plugin that would pop up at the bottom of a website, displaying a purchase another customer had recently made.</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/snCfaj5_C-1syTXy4LkPpzKMFBlQ52St0OM2P3E_zqzUVp9_Wt58QG4D2o6G3nuXYiamO1LNNi1b_cicP1781j0-BxSHMr0-XxKpoP7qY0ADq-Vq_xrId6tVHnM6keJxQ87B5CSD"></p><p>Once I saw it in action, I immediately installed it on <a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kettle &amp; Fire</a> and saw a 40% lift in conversionâ€¦ and $1,400 in extra sales (this was 2016â€¦ K&amp;F was a lot smaller then ðŸ™ƒ).</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XaXoTmu3NxGZOEawmBfaPUhytLba2rid3i3Wf6PfomzNiAukmhLSZl-Mu3RFSjQtwZRFE8hle4yE2Ty1y5jHEkCJPv7VfoPxsaQ0cNbkiTu84Vw5JCHa4rF-JYCLi9f5haDumRSe"></p><p>Woah.&nbsp;</p><p>If it helped my site this much, how many others see a similar sales lift? We had a strong hunch that we could buy Notify, add a few features, put some marketing behind it and grow it quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 1, we fired off this email:</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HEMvbe7q_x7pz90iv_OjztnMmZgiPL4Pw_QjIlFmh84HsiEX8XA6Q7UuNKALqkx_mmBMZNaufWI_SjIj2JI1Qa8B09dw63vBWYFTiek2YFbd5uZM8-ACoIlpDIq7awjpG6jOm3p4"></p><p>Buying an app, no matter how small, is a lot of work. Iâ€™d tried to purchase other software businesses in the past and understood how hard it was to come to an agreement. The process involves a good bit of legal spend and can fall apart at the drop of a hat: lessons learned after spending $10k on legal for a failed acquisition 12 months prior ðŸ¤¦.&nbsp;</p><p>We first wanted to see how serious Notifyâ€™s owner, Scott, was about selling. We emailed him and grabbed dinner just one week after our first email exchange.</p><p>During dinner, Ryan and I expressed our admiration for what Scott had accomplishedâ€”which was truly impressive. We covered our backgrounds, and shared the many ideas we had for the product that could take it to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>Dinner went swimmingly and we learned a LOT about the product. Within a day or two, we followed up with super early diligence questions:</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oQNRoVWMgHJ3bEzzDTXffQnVO1ipHtGFyUQkSqBy-M56RTL8wJ1ZL_xE-Aq9caFXoz5FtlQ4Aoa_ON-04u3Su5s4y1A2zT5vIFCznVUFurYclJy1whYDgqmHXXvSyJ2AzJexRqbS"></p><p>After taking four days to review the numbers he sent over, we responded with a Letter of Intent: a legal but non-binding letter showing we were serious about buying the business. An LOI also serves to ensure that both parties are aligned on high-level terms: what weâ€™d pay, when those payments would hit, etc.&nbsp;</p><h2>Actually buying the business</h2><p>Letâ€™s pause here for a second to address some common misconceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it may feel like youâ€™re listening to Uncle Warren Buffett espousing the benefits and strong returns that come from buying a railroad. <em>Thanks Warren, but how the hell does this apply to me?&nbsp;</em></p><p>The truth is, you donâ€™t need a lot (or any) money to buy many of these small businesses. Many small businesses you can actually buy for $0 up front, if you negotiate it properly and find a motivated seller. Where revenue is less than $20K per month, many of the businesses youâ€™re looking at arenâ€™t businesses at all: theyâ€™re jobs. And if you find an owner (like we did) who wants to quit his job, you can make a deal happen. Youâ€™ll get what you want (a revenue-generating business), the seller gets what he wants (his time back and money for his efforts), and everybody wins.&nbsp;</p><p>While negotiating this acquisition, I kept in mind something one of my mentors shared when buying assets. Assuming youâ€™re not in crazy hot competition for something, it often pays to approach deals in a certain way: â€œ<strong>my price, your terms OR your price, my terms.</strong>â€�&nbsp;</p><p>Letâ€™s say we wanted to buy an app for $1M, and wanted to pay for it over 1-2 years with monthly cash payments. Our lovely seller wants to sell for $1.5M.&nbsp;</p><p>In a scenario like this, weâ€™d put in an offer of $1M cash, up-front (his terms, our price) and see if that gets it done. Alternatively, if the seller was firm on price but didnâ€™t care as much about cash right now, weâ€™d offer $1.5M paid out over 1-2 years in monthly cash payments. His price, our terms.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, we ended up going with the other option for the Notify deal: the price the owner wanted for the company, on our terms.</p><p>Scott, Notifyâ€™s owner, wanted a high (but fair) price, and wanted to have a piece of the upside going forward. We landed on a structure that would reach his goals <em>and</em> allow us to buy the business for literally $0.&nbsp;</p><p>Hereâ€™s how (<em>note: numbers are not actuals</em>):</p><ol><li>We agreed on an overall value of the business: call it $500K.&nbsp;</li><li>We then discussed how much ownership Scott wanted to maintain in the entity going forward. Letâ€™s say we landed at 20%: we then subtracted that ownership from the total purchase price, and had to figure out how to come up with $400K to buy 80% of the business.&nbsp;</li><li>As I said earlier: he chose the price, we chose the terms. Our terms were that weâ€™d buy the business via a series of monthly payments over the next 20 months. So, in our example $400K required purchase amount, weâ€™d pay $20K/mo to buy the business.&nbsp;</li><li>Hereâ€™s the kicker: we structured the deal so that payments would begin 60 days after close. Because the business was already doing more than our monthly payments to the seller, as long as the business didnâ€™t implode (it didnâ€™t ðŸ˜…), <strong>weâ€™d be able to buy the business with its own revenue</strong>. $0 out of our own pockets.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Once the price and terms were baked into the LOI (and the seller signed), we moved into deeper diligence. Just 23 days after our first email to Scott ðŸ�Žï¸�!&nbsp;</p><p>We asked him to complete a questionnaire about Notifyâ€™s growth, revenue, tools used, etc., as well as give us all the logins related to the business. Over the next two weeks, as we dug into the info he sent us, we worked with a lawyer to pull together an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA)â€”the document that would make the sale official.</p><p>Fast forward to closing day: March 10, 2016. We received a signed APA, and became owners of a business that was generating cash!</p><p>Several years later, Notify has become <a href="http://fomo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fomo</a>: a software business that does $1M+ each year.&nbsp;</p><p>Though buying a small SaaS business is more competitive now, there are still a ton of opportunities to buy small assets and scale them on the side. If I were to run this strategy again, Iâ€™d focus on a few areas:</p><ol><li>Buying land and putting it on Hipcamp and other camping rental sites (as I discussed in <a href="https://justinmares.substack.com/p/the-next-brand-episode-13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my last newsletter</a>, please God someone reach out to me and help me do this).&nbsp;</li><li>Buying up small apps in the Google Chrome or Mac app store.</li><li>Buying assets on rapidly growing platforms. Could you buy out a Fortnite skins developer? A creator on Roblox? A top theme developer on Webflow or Shopify? A tool on Figma?&nbsp;</li><li>Buying small software businesses in industries tech doesnâ€™t traditionally touch. In my world of CPG (consumer packaged goods) and food, there are a <em>ton</em><strong> </strong>of small software opportunities where a strong operator could buy an asset, tune it up, and do quite well.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Happy hunting!&nbsp;</p><p><em>Note â€“ this post originally appeared on Justin's newsletter&nbsp;</em><a href="https://justinmares.substack.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Next Brand</em></a><em>.</em></p>

      <div>
        <p>tldr; reimplement standard library functions in your favorite
language <em>without loops</em>.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>For a few years after college I spent a lot of free time doing
projects in Standard ML and Scheme. As a result I got really
comfortable doing recursion. The two big reasons for this are 1)
neither Standard ML or Scheme have loops and 2) they both have very
small standard libraries. (Ok, they have loops. They're just so
limited as to be useless.)</p>
<p>I ended up building <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/ponyo">a standard
library</a> for Standard ML including
string functions (contains, indexOf, count, replace, etc.), an HTTP
server and client, a hash table, a binary search tree, parts of a
Standard ML parser, and <a href="https://ponyo.org/reference">so on</a>.</p>
<p>All of this without loops.</p>
<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3><p>The good news (if you don't want to learn a new language) is that you
don't have to take up Standard ML or Scheme to get better at
recursion. But you do need to dedicate some time to <em>practicing
recursion</em> to get better at it.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be to pick 10-20 string or array functions out
of your favorite language's standard library and reimplement them
without loops. (Obviously, start simple and just pick one. But
don't stop there.)</p>
<h3 id="some-examples">Some examples</h3><p>Here's an example reimplementation of <code>indexOf</code> in
JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>function indexOf(input, toMatch) {
  function helper(index, offset, test) {
    if (index === input.length) {
      return -1;
    }

    if (toMatch === test) {
      return index;
    }

    if (input[index+offset] !== toMatch[offset] || test.length &gt; toMatch.length) {
      return helper(index+1, 0, "");
    }

    return helper(index, offset+1, test+input[index+offset]);
  }

  return helper(0, 0, "");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or here's an example immutable reimplementation of <code>insert</code>
in Python:</p>
<pre><code>def insert(arr, index, item):
  def helper(currentIndex, accum):
    if currentIndex == len(arr):
      return accum
    if currentIndex &lt; index:
      return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [arr[currentIndex]])
    if currentIndex == index:
      return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [item, arr[currentIndex]])
    return helper(currentIndex+1, accum + [arr[currentIndex]])
  return helper(0, [])
</code></pre>
<p>
  You're going to find an edge case and that's all right. The
  important part at the moment is practicing recursion.
</p><p>For bonus points, avoid all mutation in your implementations and use
only tail recursion.</p>
<p>Happy recursion!</p>

All the participants exercised regularly in the cold, whether it was running outside, cross-country skiing or ski mountaineering.</p>  <p>All participants reported having some type of respiratory symptom&nbsp;after running in the cold (most said they had a cough), and breathing tests revealed that nine out of the 16 showed symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways, consistent with levels that would be considered exercise-induced asthma.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938610.1614976337!/fileImage/httpImage/lungs2.gif"></p></div><figcaption>As the winter athlete begins to heavily inhale cold, dry air, the bronchioles can begin to constrict as if they are under threat. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Sködt McNalty/CBC Graphics)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>What happens to lungs in the cold</h2>  <p>A main issue with exercising in the cold, especially in temperatures –15 C and colder, is the lack of moisture in the air.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When dry air hits the lungs, especially when someone is breathing heavily, it can provoke the lungs to react as if they were under threat.&nbsp;The airways essentially constrict to protect themselves.</p>  <p>Kennedy has compared the effects of&nbsp;room temperature dry air against cold dry air, and his findings suggest that dry air that's also cold can provoke even more of a reaction,&nbsp;which may explain why chronic cough is so common among winter athletes, he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some research from around the world is beginning to suggest&nbsp;people who spend years exercising in cold, dry conditions might become more sensitive to lung irritants over time, according to Kennedy, although he cautions more data in this area is still needed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Over time, if you repeat that irritation or that provocation, the lung just becomes less capable of healing itself,"&nbsp;said Kennedy.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938593.1614976349!/fileImage/httpImage/lungs.gif"></p></div><figcaption>A cross section of a bronchiole shows how muscles constrict to make the airway more narrow. It is the same process that takes place in people experiencing asthma symptoms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Sködt McNalty/CBC Graphics)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Ways to protect your lungs</h2>  <p>Gordon Giesbrecht, the director of the Laboratory for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, agrees the cold, dry air can be an issue for anyone who engages in heavy cardiovascular activity on a regular basis in the winter. He likens the experience of lung constriction to trying to take a deep breath through an ever-narrowing straw.</p>  <p>"You can't freeze your lungs," he said. "You're not going to cause any damage although it is possible that continuous long-term training in the cold actually does make you more susceptible to this (bronchoconstriction)."</p>  <p>Both Giesbrecht and Kennedy say a simple face covering, such as a fabric mask, neck warmer or scarf, can go a long way to protecting the lungs from being irritated.</p>  <p>"If you cover your mouth, you're essentially warming the air and humidifying the air in a very productive manner," said Kennedy. "So essentially, your lung has to deal with less cold, dry air."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rideau-canal-skating.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5938600.1614970180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rideau-canal-skating.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A simple face covering, such as a mask, scarf or neck warmer, can help humidify and warm air before it hits the lungs. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Brian Morris/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>He also suggests that athletes take time to warm up before they exercise and take it easy on very cold days by slowing down their pace.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He hopes his work helps to change the culture of winter sport in Canada so that athletes&nbsp;take steps to prevent&nbsp;symptoms such as chronic cough, lung pain and wheezing.</p>  <p>"One of the things I want to do in the next 10 years is try to prevent some of this acute dysfunction from happening by improving the behaviours of younger skiers or winter sports athletes," Kennedy said.</p>  <p>Later this month, he plans to begin his next study — a survey of cross-country skiers and biathlon athletes&nbsp;asking them to elaborate on any respiratory&nbsp;symptoms they have so researchers have a better sense of the scope of the issue. He plans to expand the study to winter runners and other recreational athletes as well.</p>  <p>For now, Stewart-Jones&nbsp;brushes off the concerns about cold-weather exercise on her breathing. No serious athlete, including herself,&nbsp;would turn down a race because it's –18C, she said. As far as face coverings go, she wears them if her skin is at risk of freezing but she avoids them otherwise — neck warmers, like masks, can make it slightly more difficult to breathe.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I guess it's so normal and common for people to have irritated lungs that it's not something I think about," she said between a couple, short bursts of coughing after competing in Oberstdorf, Germany, at the World Championships in late February.</p>  <p>"For sure it feels like it's probably not great for my lungs long term."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

   Visual design updates that are more than skin&nbsp;deep

</h2>
    

    






    


  </header>

  <section>
    <p>When a new major version of some piece of software is released, there is often an immediate focus put on visual changes. If there aren’t a ton of new and shinies, social media will inevitably be filled with words like “stale,” “old,” and “outdated.” This has become especially true for elementary OS, whose visual design hasn’t really changed all that much over the years. At elementary, we tend to avoid making changes for the sake of change. We’re very skeptical about design trends, and do our best to create things that feel a bit more “evergreen.” After all, “Good design is long lasting” and this allows us to focus more on refining than constantly reinventing. We also have a third-party developer community to think about, and making sweeping visual changes means that the nearly 200 apps in AppCenter will have to be updated and tested to make sure they still look as intended. So, when we decided to work on the look and feel for elementary OS 6, we wanted to approach things with a lot of intentionality, avoiding trends and focusing on setting the stage for the next several years.</p>



<p>App developers rely on pre-made widgets to do a lot of the heavy lifting and provide good default styles when making their apps. In addition to the widgets provided by GTK, we also ship our GTK companion library Granite that makes replicating common elementary design patterns a breeze. In elementary OS 6, we’re also making heavy use of Handy—a library that was originally developed by Purism for mobile interfaces but has now become a core part of the GNOME app development platform on the desktop. Thanks to Handy, we have two major, obvious visual design improvements that developers can adopt.</p>



<p>We’ve long had plans to modernize the Granite Avatar widget. A continual problem we’ve faced is that many people just don’t set an avatar for their user account. As a consequence, we need a more meaningful fallback design that allows avatars to be distinct and useful in apps like Mail or in System Settings. As it turns out, the folks behind Handy had the same thoughts and the work was largely already done. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exalm">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> was very helpful and gracious in implementing changes in Handy to achieve the exact style we wanted, and I’m happy to say that we now have much more colorful interfaces in elementary OS 6 thanks to Handy Avatar, even if people don’t set avatar images.</p>

<p>The other obvious change is more rounded bottom window corners. This seems like something that would be simple, but is actually not possible in vanilla GTK3. In elementary OS 5, we used clever workarounds for specific cases to give dialogs and other flat windows rounded corners all the way around. But in elementary OS 6, we can now have rounded bottom corners even in complex cases like Camera, thanks to Hdy.Window. It’s a small thing, but it definitely makes the whole UI feel just a bit more polished.</p>

<figcaption>Hey, it's me! But more importantly, the bottom corners are rounded here</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>

<p>The default typefaces in elementary OS have also been changed for the first time since our initial brand work. Instead of Open Sans with Raleway for headers, we’ve unified on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>: a new, modern typeface specifically designed for use in user interfaces on computer screens. The designer, Rasmus Andersson, actively updates Inter and has been very responsive on GitHub. He’s even weighed in on our use of Inter in elementary OS, and his feedback has led to changes in the weights we use for various headers.</p>

<figcaption>Inter being used on Granite Demo's welcome screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve also revisited the default font rendering settings, opting for grayscale anti-aliasing over RGB; this addresses some issues we’ve seen with ghosting/leaking of colors around text, especially visible when using transparency. You’ll find that in general, text is bolder, higher contrast, and more legible in elementary OS 6.</p>

<h2 id="iconography">Iconography</h2>

<p>The visual style for our icons has remained largely unchanged, with more focus put on internal consistency. You’ll notice subtle improvements such as a more consistent use of our color palette, plus more gender-neutral depictions of a “user” in places like System Settings.</p>

<figure>

  </picture>
<figcaption>New user accounts icon</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A long outstanding issue has been wrangling all the different styles of arrows that we’ve used over the years. There are hundreds of arrow icons in the elementary icon set, used across many different contexts. We provide both full color and flat, symbolic icons and in a range of different sizes. There are even different kinds of arrow tails depending on context, or no tail at all. In elementary OS 6, we have one new shape to rule them all and we’ve given arrows more rounded corners.</p>

<figure>
  <picture>
    <img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/look-and-feel-changes-coming-elementary-os-6/arrows.svg">
  </picture>
  <figcaption>A small portion of the new arrow icons</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In arrows with curved tails, such as in Mail tool icons, the area under the curve is larger, making the shape more recognizeable at small sizes or for folks with less acute vision. We’ve also reduced busy overlap and improved separation in symbolic icons, which now match their full color counterparts much more closely.</p>

  <figcaption>New Mail tool icons</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re rounding out corners and using bolder shapes in other places as well. The new media controls icons for example feel much more weighty, and the lightning bolt symbol used on power icons is more distinct. Historically, going into more detail hasn’t been as important on LoDPI displays, but the new shapes really shine on displays with more pixels available.</p>

  </picture>
  <figcaption>New power and media controls icons</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="stylesheet">Stylesheet</h2>

<p>One recurring bit of feedback that we’ve received is that in general, the stylesheet in elementary OS 5 is somewhat low contrast. Low contrast can make it hard to read text for visually impaired users, but it can also be a large problem on lower quality displays. Contrast between widgets and their backgrounds can also help clearly define different parts of an application, and especially which of those parts are interactive. Addressing these concerns is part of our larger project to make elementary OS 6 more accessible by default, which we’ve written about previously.</p>



<p>To ensure we achieve the desired contrast, we created a design system built on UI levels. With a little bit of Sass magic, we can style widgets by picking a background level—such as 0 for inputs or 4 for toolbars—and then overlaying a white gradient and adding a shadow—which also comes in various levels. The overall result is a style that is a bit flatter on the surface of each layer, but overall more consistent in its use of depth, and with much more consistent and expressive use of shadows between layers.</p>

  </picture>
<figcaption>Files with different levels as shown in inputs, sidebars, tabbars, actionbars, and headerbars</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another place for more clear differentiation is in widget states. Interfaces are interactive: they can be selected, disabled, focused, or pressed. We started some work towards more clearly differentiated states in elementary OS 5 when we redesigned checkboxes, and in elementary OS 6 this work has extended to other interactive widgets like text entries and buttons. Disabled widgets, for example, are much more obviously darker than the default UI level, and are intentionally lower contrast than enabled widgets.</p>

</figure>

<p>Something we knew we needed to consider from very early on was a path towards making elementary OS feel more personal without breaking custom styles in apps. We know that many of our users are currently using custom CSS, but that it often leads to breakage and disappointment. In elementary OS 6, we provide 10 possible accent colors to choose from. Combined with the dark style, you can get a much more unique look for your operating system without having to worry about apps behaving incorrectly. The dark style follows all the same principles as outlined above including UI levels, using higher contrast, etc. And we’re still exploring more ways to expose your chosen accent color in ways that feel fun and personal.</p>

<p>Focus styles are still a work in progress, but the goal here is to make much more bold use of color and to make the keyboard focus location much more obvious. We’ve also revisited selected states and suggested action button styles to make sure that we’re clearly differentiating between someone’s strawberry accent color and destructive action buttons. Instead of using white text on a colored background, we now use a much subtler style that is ultimately higher contrast as well. It also works much better for accent colors, custom brand colors in apps, or other places where we want to use color such as Calendar events.</p>

<p>We also hear regularly from users who have displays that sit in that uncomfortable zone between 1× and 2× UI scaling. While we’re still not offering traditional fractional scaling in elementary OS, we have been working on an improved scalable UI solution. In elementary OS 5, people who opted to change the default text size were left with an awkwardly spaced UI with large text, but small controls. In elementary OS 6, we now scale default widgets spacing, corner radii, etc. with text size, eliminating a lot of that awkwardness. It’s not quite perfect, but it will make elementary OS much more legible for more people without incurring the performance penalty associated with traditional fractional scaling. And we’re happy to have a more first-class experience for those who need larger text.</p>

                    <section>

                      <p><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/E-field.jpg" alt="E-field" width="163" height="208">Electric fields are created by the voltage present in the electrical system, either the building wiring or power cords. A current flow is not necessary to create an electric field. This means a device does not have to be turned on to create an electric field. Electric fields can usually be easily eliminated or shielded. Electric field measurements complex as the investigator’s body affects and diverts the electric field which in turn influences the measurement results. Electric fields are measured in Volt per meter (V/m). The most common source for electric fields in residential buildings is the internal wiring system due to the use of unshielded, plastic sheeted Romex cables and unshielded power cords.</p>
<p>The electric (E) field emissions in this residential bedroom are originating from the electrical wiring system inside the wall cavity. The electrical conduit is running horizontally about 20 inches above the floor level connecting the electrical outlets in the room. An additional E-field source is the ungrounded/unshielded power cord for the reading light. Therefore, we need a two pronged approach. First, eliminating the E-field emissions from the walls, and secondly rewiring the light with a power cord with a shielded and grounded power cord.</p>
<p>The benchmark or target goal of this E field mitigation is E-field level of below or equal to 0.3V/m. <em>The Building Biology Evaluation Guidelines for Sleeping Areas SBM-2015</em> and the Austrian Medical Association (ÖÄK) use the following criteria for bedrooms.</p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table.png');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table.png"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table.png" alt="Baubiology Guideline" width="785" height="78" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table.png 916w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-300x29.png 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-860x85.png 860w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-320x31.png 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-775x76.png 775w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px"></a></p>
<p><span><span>The first step is to unplug the reading light and to conduct E-field measurements at the bed site. The photo on the left shows the bedroom with the bed in place and the headboard wall. E-field measurements are conducted area at nine (9) different points at the top surface of the bed. The color graphic show the electric field levels detected in Volt/meter (V/m) at each location. The top represent the headboard area of the bed and the bottom the foot area. </span></span></p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before-300x300.jpg" alt="Electric Fields Before" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before-320x320.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before-130x130.jpg 130w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/before.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-1.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-1-300x225.jpg" alt="Bedroom before shielding" width="408" height="306" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-1.jpg 619w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-1-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px"></a></p>
<p>After the first application of the shielding paint (<em>YShield HSF54</em>) to the headboard wall surface, measurements were repeated at the same nine locations to evaluate the results, i.e. determine what reduction has been achieved and if the target goal has been reached. For the E-field shield to work it has to be connected to ground. A grounding plate and grounding straps are attached to the wall and a cable connected to ground.</p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle-300x300.jpg" alt="Electric Field Results" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle-320x320.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle-130x130.jpg 130w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Middle.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>

<p><span><span>The measurement results show a significant E-field reduction in the head and center area of the bed. However, it is apparent that the wall to the right of the bed has some impact on the field levels (yellow areas). Therefore, we now applied a shielding coat to the wall to the right of the bed. </span></span></p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-3.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-3-300x225.jpg" alt="After shielding of 2 walls" width="325" height="244" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-3-320x240.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-3.jpg 678w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px"></a></p>

<p><span><span>It is imperative that all E-field shielding surfaces are connected to a proper grounding system and continuity of conductance of shielding surfaces is achieved. Any grounding work should be conducted by a licensed and experience electrical contractor. Grounding is also important part of electrical safety in such a project. </span></span><span><span>After two walls are now shielded, the measurements are repeated. The graphic below shows the results obtained afterwards.</span></span></p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/After.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/After.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/After-285x300.jpg" alt="Electric Fields After" width="285" height="300" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/After-285x300.jpg 285w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/After-320x336.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/After.jpg 475w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px"></a></p>

<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-5.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-5.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-5-300x224.jpg" alt="Foto 5" width="356" height="266" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-5-300x224.jpg 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-5-320x239.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-5.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px"></a></p>
<p>The measurement results show the target goal has been achieved. E-field levels are now zero in the head area and all remaining areas are below or at our benchmark of 0.3 V/m. Congratulation, the mitigation project has been successful.</p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-6.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-6.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-6-300x235.jpg" alt="Bedroom after shielding completed" width="190" height="149" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-6-300x235.jpg 300w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-6-320x250.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-6.jpg 388w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px"></a>To complete the project, need to repaint the wall. We used <em>Zinsser BIN Shellac</em> primer to counteract any potential odor emissions from the shielding paint. Two coats were applied. Finally, a coat of flat latex paint was applied to bring the room back to the original color theme and the shielding mitigation is not noticeable.</p>
<p>The last step is the rewiring of the reading light with a shielded power cord by electrician. This is scheduled to be performed. We place cut off switch into the outlet, in the meantime, so that the room can be occupied again. The occupant will have to turn the reading light off at the outlet switch to break the electrical connection and not at the reading light.<a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-7.jpg');" href="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-7.jpg"><img src="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-7-291x300.jpg" alt="Switch to eliminate E-field" width="177" height="182" srcset="http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-7-291x300.jpg 291w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-7-320x329.jpg 320w, http://www.emfrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Foto-7.jpg 426w" sizes="(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px"></a></p>
<p>The following individuals were part of the EMF Mitigation Consortium that completed the successful E-field shielding project. Have a good night’s rest.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        
        <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
        
         
      
      <p><em>Note: Since it came up last time, I’m not in any way affiliated with any of the entities discussed in this article</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-web-monetization">What is Web Monetization</h2>
<p><a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> is a browser API that allows content creators to monetize content, and content consumers to pay for it, anonymously, without ads or any friction, like paywalls and subscriptions.</p>
<p>The basic concept is that a content creator signals they’re accepting payments, and the content consumer, via a browser extension, natively in the browser or by account linking, streams micropayments via the <a href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger</a>, which supports a wide variety of providers and currencies ( real and crypto). The point is, as a consumer you pay for what you consume directly ( instead of indirectly via tracking and ads ) and proportionally.</p>
<p>It’s based on an open <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification.html">specification</a> which is still a work in progress, but fully functional.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-participate-in-it">Why you should participate in it</h2>
<p>A lot of people don’t like ads - be it because they find them wasteful, too obnoxious, too insistent, too intrusive, too dumb, etc. Even more people dislike tracking ( the art of following user actions across the internet to serve them more “relevant” ads based on their interests ), because that centralises a lot of power and knowledge in a few big companies ( Google, Facebook, etc. ), and allows precise targeting, which has been used for some nasty things. If I may quote the EFF directly:</p>
<p><em>Over the years, the machinery of targeted advertising has frequently been used for <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/payday-lenders-are-finding-ways-around-googles-ad-ban">exploitation</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-advertisers/u-s-charges-facebook-with-racial-discrimination-in-targeted-housing-ads-idUSKCN1R91E8">discrimination</a>, and <a href="https://stoponlinevaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Black-ID-Target-by-Russia-Report-SOVAW.pdf">harm</a>. The ability to target people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, or ability allows discriminatory ads for jobs, housing, and credit. Targeting based on credit history - or characteristics systematically associated with it - enables predatory ads for high-interest loans. Targeting based on demographics, location, and political affiliation helps purveyors of politically motivated disinformation and voter suppression.</em></p>
<p>A big part of the aforementioned people, and plenty of others, use ad blockers ( either as browser plugins like AdBlock Plus or Ublock (Origin), or DNS-level like PiHole and AdGuard Home ), which block ads, trackers and various analytics software, which aren’t necessarily the same as trackers - their main purpose is to analyse and aggregate users of the website, by country, language, browser, device type (mobile, PC), how they came upon the website, how much time they spent on what page, etc. compared to trackers' main purpose, which is to analyse per-user (anonymised, but still) interests and behaviour and recommend related ads.</p>
<p>There are proposals by Google to supposedly improve upon the experience of tracking ( in part due to major browsers like Firefox blocking some of the technology enabling such tracking ), but there are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">major issues with them</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for a lot of web content creators, ads remain the main way to make money of the content they produce, which could be just to compensate costs, as a reward for the time spent, or even potentially to allow transferring to full time content producing. And for a lot of content consumers, blocking ads removes the only way to “pay”, baring some direct donations scheme.</p>
<p>Ideally, there should be an easy way to directly pay for the content you consume. In some cases you can subscribe and pay a monthly fee, but that could never cover it all - nobody will pay for every small blog, recipe/repair tutorial/gardening tips website/YouTube channel. How much value do they bring to you ? How much would you pay for them? How would you know they’re worth it without using them first, and why would they allow you to use them for free, when most users would be one-shot coming from a search engine? And then there’s non-profit open/crowdsourced institutions like <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> ( which is Web Monetized) whose principles make them incompatible with ads and paywalls/subscriptions and force them to rely on donations.</p>
<p>Enter Web Monetization - with almost no friction, content consumers pay-per-use ( time spent ), automatically, and more or less anonymously. If content creators desire, there can be exclusive features only for “paying” ( participating in Web Monetization ) users, or no ads for them.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the concept is nothing new - the French Minitel ( more info on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Wikipedia</a> and a fascinating read by the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/cyberspace/minitel-the-online-world-france-built-before-the-web">IEEE</a>) system, in a sense a predecessor of the Internet, which among other things, contained specifically paying per time spent on pages.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, there is only one Web Monetization provider - <a href="https://coil.com/">Coil.com</a>, but the API is open so in theory anyone can join in and compete with them.</p>
<p>For content consumers, they provide browser extensions ( which are FOSS under the Apache 2.0 licence and available on <a href="https://github.com/coilhq/web-monetization-projects">GitHub</a>) and subscriptions ($5 USD/month), which are spent at the rate of $0.36 USD an hour, providing for roughly 13 hours of content consumption. After $4.50 is spent, the rate is lowered to last until the end of the month. Said subscription also includes some perks, such as ad-free experiences on <a href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/perks/imgur-emerald">Imgur</a> with Emerald and <a href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/perks/cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> ( a subscription-based video content platform).</p>
<p>For content creators, you need an account with a virtual wallet providers that supports ILP ( the Interledger protocol used to make the magic happen, like <a href="https://www.uphold.com/">Uphold</a> and <a href="https://gatehub.net/">Gatehub</a> ) and an HTML meta tag with the address of your wallet ( like so <code>&lt;meta name="monetization" content="$ilp.uphold.com/8Q6r7F3XjXEi"&gt;</code> ) in the code of your website. The latter can be added manually or via any of the existing plugins (there are ones for <a href="https://github.com/sabinebertram/hugo-webmonetization-component">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrmuhammadali/gatsby-plugin-monetization">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sorxrob/svelte-monetization">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/coil-web-monetization/">Wordpress</a>). For some cases where that’s impossible, Coil allow you to connect with YouTube and Twitch directly.</p>
<p>Anonymity and privacy are provided by the way things work - that wallets are randomly generated IDs, Coil transfer the money, the wallet provider knows who the recipient is, the content creators knows how much they’ve received, but nobody knows everything. <a href="https://coil.com/p/sharafian/Doubling-Down-on-Privacy/cD_ZiwT2J">Here’s a post</a> by Coil’s co-founder and CTO Ben Sharafian discussing wallet-side and sender-site (based on <a href="https://privacypass.github.io/">PrivacyPass</a>) privacy techniques they and the wallet providers use to ensure everyone’s privacy is respected.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Of course, that could never replace premium subscription services like the Financial Times, or even direct ones like Substack due to the limited amounts involved, and it isn’t trying to - the point is to help monetise smaller sized websites ( and Youtube/Twitch channels ) <em>or</em> open/crowdsourced/non-profit institutions by providing a decent alternatives to obnoxious ads (which millions of people block anyway ) and paywalls. For instance the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a> are web monetized; and so is this and some other small-scale personal blogs. It’s more similar to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">Buy me a coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a>, only more automated, ubiquitous and with less effort.</p>
<p>However, it’s relatively recent and not very popular yet - according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/WebMotized">WebMotized</a> Twitter bot there’s only 1482 web monetized websites so far. Some more participation is needed, on both sides ( content creators and consumers) to make it a viable alternative to ads and some paywalls. I already did my part</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--summary">Conclusion &amp; Summary</h2>
<p>Are you a content consumer or provider, or both? Don’t like ads and privacy invading tracking? Participate in Web Monetization!</p>

        <p>
        - 6th March 2021
        </p><p>TLDR: I made a super fast (much faster than cp) command line copy program, with a nice progress bar. The implementation dives into some interesting bits of low level async I/O on linux.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/wheybags/wcp">wcp</a> is a file copying experiment I've been working on for the past while. Really, it's an excuse to try out <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring</a>, a relatively new asynchronous I/O system on linux.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/wcp_demo.gif"></p><p>wcp in action</p>
        <p>If you're unfamiliar with async I/O, it allows you to queue up reads and writes to run in the background, and check back later to see if they're done, without having to wait before you start doing other things (like submitting even more requests). This ain't no fancy pantsy high-level javascript event loopy memory safey framework though. It's a ring buffer in memory shared directly with the kernel, and you're responsible for reading and writing the right things at the right time. Luckily the io_uring authors wrote a <a href="https://github.com/axboe/liburing">handy library</a> that eases some of the pain of this.</p>
        <p>I've been wanting to try my hand at a file copying program for ages - it always confused me that my options for getting a progress bar for a command line copy were so slim. There's been <code>rsync --info=progress2</code> for a while now, but I'll be honest, I have no idea how to read that output.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/rsync.gif"></p><p>What even is this?</p>
        <p>So, when I read about io_uring, I figured it was an excellent opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. I set out to <em>match</em> native cp's performance, and provide a nice progress bar, with some decent ETA (estimated time remaining) calculation. What I did not expect, was to significantly <em>beat</em> cp's speeds. I figured it should be close to, if not at, the limit for file copying performance. And people do always say cp is a bit faster than rsync. In the end, I got something that (disclaimer: works on my machine) is quite a lot faster than cp:</p>
        <h4>20 512MiB files</h4>
        <p>
wcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.97s,&nbsp;&nbsp;2579.59&nbsp;MiB/s<br>
cp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.44s,&nbsp;&nbsp;1213.38&nbsp;MiB/s<br>
rsync&nbsp;17.26s, 593.33&nbsp;&nbsp;MiB/s</p>
        
        <p>These numbers are from a Samsung SSD, I doubt there would be much gain on a spinning metal disk, but I don't have any around anymore to test on.</p>
        <h3>Implementation notes</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>ETA calculation</h4>
        <p>The way the ETA calculation works is pretty interesting IMO. We measure the speed periodically in a separate thread that is devoted to displaying the progress bar. The current speed is estimated by looking at the amount of bytes copied now, and comparing it to the amount of bytes that had been copied 45 seconds ago.</p>
        <p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/estimation.png"></p>
        <p>There is an <a href="https://xkcd.com/612/">xkcd</a> for everything</p>
        <p>This works pretty well, but the problems arise when you have a scenario like the following: You've been copying a bunch of large files, and your current speed estimate is high. Most of your remaining files, however, are small. Small file copies are dominated by the overheads of opening and closing the files, and various bookkeeping around the actual copy. This means, if we use our current speed to estimate how long it will take to copy the remaining files, our estimate will be way too low. The estimate will also swing around wildly depending on what size files we are processing right now.</p>
        <p>I attempted to solve this by conceptually splitting the stack of files to copy into two piles: big and small. A file is "big" if it's over 5KiB, and "small" otherwise. I keep track of the remaining "copies" (a piece of a file) for big and small files separately. Every time a copy chunk completes, I check its size. If it's big, I decrement the "bigFilesRemaining" counter, and similar for small. I also push the big/small status of the copy into a fixed size bitset. This means that at any given moment I can tell: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What my speed is now</li>
            <li>How many of the last N files I copied were big, and how many small</li>
            <li>How many big and small files I have left to copy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>What I do with this information, is that every time I calculate my speed, I add it into a rolling average. But there is not just one rolling average, there are actually eight. If the last 8 copies that completed were all small, the "big" count is zero, so I add my speed into the first rolling average bucket. If four were big, and four were small, it goes in the fourth bucket. Conceptually, the first bucket represents 0% big files, the fourth 50%, and the eighth 100% big. I can then look at the ratio of big/small in the remaining files left to copy, and use that to decide which bucket represents the best estimate of the speed for my total set of remaining files.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/wcp_eta_graph.png"></p><p>Crude graph of ETA error over time, copying an ~6GiB directory of mixed size files over nfs</p>
        <p>This approach seems to work out pretty well. In the graph above, the error in the ETA (the difference between the ETA we predicted at that point, vs the actual finishing time) drops to about 20 seconds after about 30 seconds have elapsed.</p>
        <h4>asynciness</h4>
        <p>There are a few parts to a file copying program - we need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Iterate the source folder to gather a list of files to copy</li>
            <li>Create the destination folders</li>
            <li>Open the source and destination files</li>
            <li>Copy the data from source to destination</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Of these, only the data copying part is currently done asynchronously. The reason for this is twofold: one, that's the part that takes the most time (usually), and two, io_uring doesn't currently support directory operations (enumerate files in directory and make directory). I actually did do some experimenting with adding <code>IORING_OP_GETDENTS</code> and <code>IORING_OP_MKDIRAT</code> opcodes to io_uring, and made a branch of wcp that uses them, but I haven't tried submitting to the upstream kernel (at least not yet, I might do eventually). Also, I didn't see a massive performance gain. Another point is that trying to submit a patch to the kernel is pretty intimidating :v</p>

  <p>As I sat at the end of a long conference table in the Spring of 2016, I stared out the window taking in the Miami skyline. I had just wrapped up my pitch to a local fund hoping to secure $250,000 for my startup at the time and was now listening to them pass. As my attention waned, ready to move on to the next pitch of the day, one of the partners leaned in close to me. With his hand on my shoulder and a smile on his face: He said, “You should raise a friend and family round! Then you can come back in six months, and we’ll revisit this idea of yours.”</p>

<p>I was perplexed by the sincerity of the suggestion. I lived in North Miami, paying $900 a month for rent, and my friends and family live paycheck-to-paycheck. I would have been surprised if my immediate family’s total savings at the time surpassed $5,000, let alone anything close to what I was raising. Then I remembered, this person lives in a completely different world. For him, the idea that the person pitching him grew up in poverty is such a foreign concept that to fit me into his mental model, he assumes my family has wealth. After all, who is insane enough to do a startup with no safety net?</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, as millionaires and billionaires alike have lambasted Senator Warren’s proposal of a “wealth tax,” I am reminded again of that separate world. For many Black people who have found success, the idea of “personal wealth” doesn’t exist because to have wealth is to share it. Their money isn’t just theirs; it’s their mom’s rent, their sisters used car, food on the table of a struggling family member, Christmas gifts under the tree. For every dollar earned, you don’t value it based on what it can get you, but how far it can go for others. That is why it should come as no surprise that so few Black people have successfully built generational wealth: we’re always actively trying to keep the current generation alive.</p>

<p>Even still, despite knowing the tax of finding success, of being one of the first people to “make it” in their family, each day, Black people across America put their hearts and souls into their work. They overcome socioeconomic inequality issues, racism, and sexism to move mountains to pursue their dreams because personal success isn’t solely measured by the size of dollars earned – which guarantees what they are working on will be that much more valuable.</p>

<p>If Paul Graham believes a wealth tax will cause people <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1366445681251123214">not to build startups</a>, he should invest more in Black founders. A wealth tax isn’t going to stop us from building our visions. We already pay the Black tax to do it.</p>

      <h2>It's raymarching march!</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-03-06T00:00:00+01:00">06 March 2021</time>
      <p>In preparation for my computer graphics exam next week, I decided to take an excursion to the low-level side of things:
        ray marching ASCII graphics of rotating spheres!</p>
      <h2 id="multiple-ways-to-create-an-image">Multiple ways to create an image</h2>
      <p>Generally, there are two different ways to generate an image with a computer:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Object-order rendering (rasterization)</li>
        <li>Image-order rendering (ray tracing, ray marching)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Object-order rendering is the technique commonly used for both games and visualizations alike: APIs like OpenGL allow
        you to draw objects made up from primitives like triangles piece by piece. The primitives are projected into 2D,
        depth-tests are made to ensure objects behind another one are invisible and finally, they are coloured in pixel by
        pixel. This way, you “rasterize” a 3D-object onto your screen.</p>
      <p>Image-order rendering takes a different approach, however: you do not fill the screen object after object, but pixel
        after pixel. So instead of looking at a triangle and figuring out where to draw it on the screen, you take a single
        pixel of the screen and figure out what colour it might be. As light rays emitted by a light source hit an object, some
        of them are reflected into the eye or camera of the observer. Since lots of light rays are emitted but never actually
        hit the camera, it is much more efficient to trace them backwards: send out “rays” from the camera, determine where they
        hit an object and then see if the path to the light source is occluded. This technique can allow for much more realistic
        graphics, seen with modern technology like the NVIDIA RTX GPUs that employ a mixture of object-order and image-order
        rendering.</p>
      <p>While these techniques <em>can</em> be used to produce high-quality images, in this article we will try to render an image made
        up of ASCII characters into the terminal. It can be easily adapted to output image files, though.</p>
      <h2 id="raymarching-introduction">Raymarching introduction</h2>
      <p>In this article, we will focus on image-order rendering, and ray marching in particular. Where ray tracing consists of a
        scene made up of primitives whose intersections with the ray are calculated using “fixed” algorithms, ray marching
        represents the scene implicitly by a <em>surface distance function</em>. It maps a point in space to a lower limit of the
        distance to the nearest object in the scene – similar to radar, it tells us how much further we can go without
        hitting anything.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Now that we know <a href="https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language">how to read assembly
language</a>,
we can talk about how parameter passing works at the machine level and
its consequences for writing faster code. We will focus on x86_64, but
ARM64 works in a roughly similar way.</p><p>Let’s say you’ve written a large program, and in it you have two files:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>// Something.h
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> <span>doSomething</span>(<span>int</span> x, <span>int</span> y);
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>// OtherStuff.cpp
</span><span></span>
<span>void</span> <span>doOtherStuff</span>() {
  <span>// ...
</span><span></span>  doSomething(<span>123</span>, <span>456</span>);
  <span>// ...
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>The fundamental question of parameter passing is this: at the
assembly language level, what does <code>otherStuff</code> need to <em>do</em> to pass
<code>123</code> and <code>456</code> to <code>doSomething</code> as <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>? There is no single
machine instruction for “call this function with these arguments”;
somebody had to decide how that would work and document the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention">calling
convention</a> for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions">x86_64</a>!</p><p>On x86_64 Linux and macOS (among other OSes), these decisions follow
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">the System V AMD64
ABI</a>. If
you really want to, you can stop reading now and go read that document
instead. However, it is a long, technical specification and I’ve
personally never read it straight through. In the rest of this
article, I’ll walk through some example code, summarize how parameter
passing works in each case, and talk through the implications for how
you structure your code.</p><p>Consider this function that takes far too many arguments:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>

integer or pointer arguments (<code>intArg1</code> through <code>intArg6</code> in the
example) go into <code>%rdi</code>, <code>%rsi</code>, <code>%rdx</code>, <code>%rcx</code>, <code>%r8</code>, and <code>%r9</code>, in
that order, regardless of whether they are 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes in
size. C++ reference parameters are <a href="https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#reference-parameters">represented as
pointers</a>. The
first 8 floating point arguments go in registers <code>%xmm0</code> through
<code>%xmm7</code> (here, we use only <code>%xmm0</code> and <code>%xmm1</code>). Remaining arguments
are pushed onto the stack from right to left.</p><h2 id="consequence-consistent-argument-order--position">Consequence: consistent argument order &amp; position</h2><p>Suppose that you have a common series of arguments that you need to

still create our <code>Vec3</code> on the stack, but we must also explicitly pass
a pointer to it in <code>%rdi</code>. This is because the referred-to <code>Vec3</code>

<p>The beginning of this month marked my sixth anniversary of becoming a solo consultant. I don’t regret my decision and cannot imagine ever giving up solo consulting. I was essential in the implementation of some really interesting projects like infotainment systems for cars and driver terminals for sugar beet and forage harvesters. The income from these projects gives me the financial freedom to enjoy life more than ever before.</p>



<p>I took my anniversary as the cause for reflecting about what I should have done differently. I learned three main lessons.</p>



<ul><li>Hourly billing runs against the best interest of your customers. As a solo consultant, you have no interest in becoming more productive. The longer hours you work the higher your income. You can only change this, if you <a href="#hourly-billing">Don’t Bill by the Hour</a> but charge a value-based fee.</li><li>Charging customers for the value you provide becomes much simpler if you have a strong brand. A strong brand will <a href="#strong-brand">Make Potential Customers Call You</a>. You don’t have to search for projects any more, but projects will find you.</li><li><a href="#productised-services">Productised Services</a> are part product and part service. The product part is the same for all customers, whereas the service part is specific to each customer. You maximise your profit by minimising the time you spend on the service part.</li></ul>



<p>I will heed the conclusions drawn from these lessons and implement them step by step. How about you?</p>



<h2 id="hourly-billing">Don’t Bill by the Hour</h2>



<p>In a recent project, I had a revealing argument with my customer and another company X involved in the project. I was billing by the hour. X provided a fairly unfinished software “product” for a fixed price. My software and X’s software had an interface. </p>



<p>The argument was whether X or I should do a change. The change would have cost X one week and me ten weeks. Obviously, X didn’t want to spend one week for free. Their managing director told me – in the presence of the customer: “What is your problem? You get paid by the hour, don’t you? So, just do it and take the money.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe my ears. After regaining my composure, I answered: “I regard such behaviour as unethical, because our customer would suffer a substantial and unnecessary loss.” All the customer’s managers including the CEO sided with X, as they concluded that bending the company X to their will was more trouble than an individual. And anyway, I would be paid for the extra work.</p>



<p>I gave up at that time and did the extra work. In hindsight, I should have terminated the project at that point, as similar arguments predictably happened over and over again. I had to bear the extra work most of the time. These arguments didn’t help the mood and motivation of the project team.</p>



<p>The example shows how ingrained hourly billing is. Customers accept it as God given, although they know that they are ripped off. The consultant’s and the customer’s incentives are clearly misaligned. Consultants try to maximise the hours billed, whereas customers try to minimise the hours billed. Consultants are punished for being more productive and for delivering higher value to the customer.</p>



<p>This misalignment leads to fruitless negotiations over hourly rates and makes it hard to increase rates even modestly. Moreover, hourly rates limit your yearly income to roughly € 240,000 – assuming very optimistically that you work for 160 hours per month all 12 months of the year and that you charge € 125 per hour.</p>



<p>Roughly one year ago, I understood that hourly billing is broken. I had never considered fixed-price projects, because the risk of loosing money is far too high. I started looking for advice on billing for consultants. I eventually stumbled over Alan Weiss’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Value-Based-Fees-Charge-Youre-Worth/dp/0470275847/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5DPQZA8OTOF&amp;keywords=value+based+fees+by+alan+weiss&amp;qid=1561405386&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=value+based+fees%2Caps%2C238&amp;sr=8-1">Value-Based Fees: How to Charge – and Get – What You’re Worth (2nd edition)</a>. </p>



<p>My aha moment about value-based fees came when I found a reference to <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/">Jonathan Stark’s work</a> in <a href="https://embeddedartistry.com/store/project-proposal-template">Philipp Johnston’s project proposal template</a>. Jonathan Stark’s book <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/hbin">Hourly Billing is Nuts</a> gives a lot of practical advice how to calculate value-based fees. As Jonathan is a software developer himself, I found his advice more applicable to my own situation than Alan Weiss’s.</p>



<p>So, what are value-based fees? Value-based fees are “fixed bids on steroids”, as Jonathan puts it. The value is the maximum amount of money a buyer is willing to pay for your customer’s product that you help build or improve. </p>



<p>Customers pay you a certain price P for your services. The value V is the return customers get from investing P into you. Your cost C is your hourly rate times the number of hours that you need to produce the required results. Your profit as a consultant is the price minus cost (P – C). Your customer’s profit is the value minus price (V – P). </p>



<p>As the price P is fixed, consultants have every incentive to reduce their time spent and to be more productive. This is also very much in your customer’s interest. The misalignment of the consultant’s and the customer’s incentives is gone. </p>



<p>The next step is to find a price P, the value-based fee, that gives a fair and healthy profit to both the customer and the consultant. Jonathan Stark gives the following formula as a rule of thumb: </p>



<p>P = max(1.85 * C, V / 10)</p>



<p>Multiplying your cost by 1.85 gives you a reasonable buffer against too low effort estimates. This sets the lower bound for your fee, whereas the value divided by 10 sets the upper bound for your fee. The closer the value is to the price, the smaller the profit is for the customer and the less likely the customer is to pay your fee.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example of how to calculate the value V. I made a conclusive argument to a home appliance maker that they could save 8 Euros per appliance for the system-on-chip, if they chose Qt instead of AngularJS to build their HMI. They plan to produce one million appliances with this new HMI per year over the next 5 years. </p>



<p>I would peg my contribution at 1 Euro per appliance or 1 million Euros for 1 million appliances per year. I would estimate 80 hours for the project at a rate of 105 Euros. So, my value-based fee would have been max(1.85 * 80 * 105, 1,000,000 / 10) = 100,000 Euros. </p>



<p>Stupid me billed 72 hours at a rate of 105 Euros, which amounted to 7,560 Euros. I felt quite cheated. At least, I could convert this experience into a <a href="https://www.qt.io/html">whitepaper</a> and a talk at a developer conference. These are two small steps towards creating my own brand, which is the topic of the <a href="#strong-brand">next section</a>.</p>



<p>I have used hourly billing for the last six years. It enabled me to put aside a good amount of money. So, hourly billing has served its purpose for me. I decided this month to switch to value-based fees. I’ll keep you posted about my experiences.</p>



<p>My best advice to aspiring solo consultants is: Buy Jonathan Stark’s <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/hbin">Complete Bundle</a> for $ 119, which includes his book <em>Hourly Billing is Nuts</em> and a couple of webinars focusing on topics like <em>How to Price Your Services</em>, <em>How to Write Proposals That Close</em> and <em>How to Prevent Scope Creep</em>. The long Q&amp;A sessions of the webinars are an additional gold mine of information. And, don’t forget to sign up for his newsletter. Jonathan’s Complete Bundle is the one resource I wish I would have had when I started solo consulting six years ago.</p>



<h2 id="strong-brand">Make Potential Customers Contact You</h2>



<p>During the last six years, I conjured 2 out of 20 projects out of nothing – starting with a cold email. One project was huge, the other small. The odds are pretty bad to win such a project. You don’t know whether you contacted the right person at the right time about the right topic. A lot of things must be <em>right</em> at the same time.</p>



<p>I found 5 of my 20 projects through trusted relationships. Someone at the customer helped me or referred me. 10 of the 20 projects were follow-up projects. If you bill by the hour, you should raise your rate for every follow-up project by more than the inflation rate. So far, I have been too stupid to do it.</p>



<p>3 out of the 20 projects found me – without me doing anything. One project was big, the other two were small. After seeing my project portfolio or reading one of my blog posts, these customers decided that I was the right person to help them. </p>



<p>These customers are your ideal customers. They have identified some pain points. They know that they need some help. They call you. Your acquisition costs are close to zero. The million-dollar question is: How do you make potential customers contact you?</p>



<p>The short answer is: Create a strong brand! If a potential customer says “Get me X to solve this problem!”, where X is your name, you obviously have  a strong brand. Here are some suggestions to improve your brand recognition.</p>



<ul><li>Write informative blog posts on your web site about your special areas of expertise. </li><li>Publish articles and white papers on web sites and in printed journals that your potential customers read.</li><li>Send a monthly or bi-monthly newsletter to relevant people.</li><li>Give talks at conferences, trade shows and meet-ups visited by your potential customers. Exhibit at these events.</li><li>Hold webinars, online courses and trainings.</li><li>Write books.</li><li>Give interviews and appear on podcasts.</li></ul>



<p>It’s only now after six years that I fully understand how a strong brand makes finding new projects so much easier: New projects find you! Be aware that building up your brand easily costs you 60 hours per month. Philipp Johnston over at <a href="https://embeddedartistry.com/">Embedded Artistry</a> does a fantastic job at building a strong brand.</p>



<h2 id="productised-services">Offer Productised Services</h2>



<p>I implemented the CAN communication for two harvesters and an e-bike, twice including code generators. I wrote several on-screen keyboards and keypads. I checked Linux systems for FOSS license compliance. I regularly customise Yocto-based board support packages such that customers can start developing their applications.</p>



<p>In short, I solved the same problem multiple times. The solutions have a high overlap, but also need some customisation. These solutions are part product and part service. They are productised services. …</p></div></article></div>

</pre><p>This is an early attempt at microarchitecture documentation for the CPU in the Apple M1, inspired by and building on the amazing work of <a href="https://uops.info/">Andreas Abel</a>,
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive/2">Andrei Frumusanu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Veedrac/microarchitecturometer">@Veedrac</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/robsize">Travis Downs</a>, <a href="http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2013/05/measuring-rob-capacity/">Henry Wong</a>
and <a href="https://agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog</a>. This documentation is my best effort, but it is based on black-box reverse engineering, and there are definitely mistakes. No warranty of any kind (and not just as a legal technicality). To make it easier to verify the information and/or identify such errors, entries in the instruction tables link to the experiments and results (~35k tables of counter values).</p>


<p>Firestorm is the high-performance microarchitecture used by the four P-cores in the M1.</p>

<h2>Firestorm Units (ports)</h2>

<p>These are refered to as "units", to try to avoid confusion if Apple releases official documentation, as they
probably refer to them as "ports" or "pipes", and order them differently. (If this just causes more confusion,
I apologise.)</p>

<pre>Integer units:

  1:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + mrs
  2:  alu + flags + branch + adr + msr/mrs nzcv + ptrauth
  3:  alu + flags + mov-from-simd/fp?
  4:  alu + mov-from-simd/fp?
  5:  alu + mul + div
  6:  alu + mul + madd + crc + bfm/extr

Load and store units (up to 128-bit loads and stores, including address generation with shifts up to LSL #3):

  7:  store + amx
  8:  load/store + amx
  9:  load
  10: load

FP/SIMD units:

  11: fp/simd
  12: fp/simd
  13: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr
  14: fp/simd + fcsel + to-gpr + fcmp/e + fdiv + frecpe + frsqrte + fjcvtzs + ursqrte + urecpe + sha
</pre>


<h2>Instruction Fusion</h2>

<p>Certain instructions are able to issue as one uop if they appear consecutively in the instruction stream.</p>

<ul>
<li>adds/subs/ands/cmp/tst + b.cc (complete fusion when fused instructions read no more than 4 registers per 6 instructions)</li>
<li>aese + aesmc (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li>aesd + aesimc (always fused if operands match pattern "A, B ; A, A")</li>
<li>pmull + eor (usually fused if operands match pattern "A, B, C ; A, A, D" or "A, B, C ; A, D, A")</li>
<li>amx + amx (excluding loads and stores - probably fuses to something like a STP)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Elimination</h2>

<p>Certain instructions do not need to issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>mov x0, 0 (handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov x0, x1 (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li>movi v0.16b, #0 (handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov v0.16b, v1.16b (usually handled by renaming)</li>
<li>mov imm/movz/movn (handled by renamer at a max of 2 per 8 instructions, includes all tested "mov")</li>
<li>nop (never issues)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Complex Latencies</h2>

<p>Several instructions have latencies that aren't adequately described in the instruction tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>MADD's output can be passed to its third operand (the addend) with 1c latency, but if it's chained with other instructions it has 3c latency.</li>
<li>Loads may be passed to the base address of other loads with 3c latency (which is nice for linked lists), but chaining with ALU operations gives a latency of 4c. (Although the second destination register in an LDP always has 4c latency.)</li>
<li>Integer to SIMD/FP roundtrip latency can be as low as 7c (e.g. when chaining flags operations).</li>
<li>Not yet in the table: pointer authentication uops have seven cycle latency, one cycle throughput. They are one uop (except for memory operations).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other limits</h2>

<p>Firestorm can retire eight instructions per cycle, but can issue more uops (using implicit shifts or extends on ALU operations, as thus far other uops retire separately).</p>

<ul>
<li>Retires per cycle: 8</li>
<li>ROB (in-flight renames): ~623</li>
<li>Integer physical register file size: ~380</li>
<li>FP/SIMD physical register file size: ~434</li>
<li>Fetch window tracking slots (in-flight I-cache lines or branches): ~144</li>
<li>Load buffers: ~129</li>
<li>Store buffers: ~108</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers mostly come from my <a href="https://gist.github.com/dougallj/5bafb113492047c865c0c8cfbc930155">M1 buffer size measuring tool</a>.
The M1 seems to use something other than an entirely conventional reorder buffer, which
complicates measurements a bit. So these may or may not be accurate.
(This paragraph previously said "it seems to use something along the lines of a validation buffer".
I think the VB hypothesis has since been disproven. Various attempts to measure ROB size
have yielded values 623, 853, and 2295 (see the previous link). My uninformed hypothesis
is that this may imply a kind of distributed reorder buffer, where only structures that
need to know about a given operation track them, and/or some kind of out-of-order retirement.)
</p>


<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
As instructions are executed, they are mapped to operations inside the processor.
This work describes two kinds, "operations that retire" (which I call "retires",
but should maybe be called "retirement slots"), and "operations that issue" (uops).
Operations that issue are limited by how many ports are available that can execute
that operation in a given cycle. Retirement slots are limited to eight per cycle,
which I have called the "retires per cycle" limit, but likely corresponds to a
frontend "decode width", rather than a limit related to retirement itself
(which I suspect could be either out-of-order, or much wider). All instructions
have at least one retire, but some instructions have more uops than retires
(e.g. ADD (shift)), and others have fewer (e.g. NOP, LDP).
</p>


<p>
These two types of operations can be measured, using the retire counter (counter 01,
undocumented, shown in the <strong>Retire</strong> column in the tables), and the
issue counter (counter 52, documented). The following three undocumented counters
(53, 54, and 55) count the same kind of uops as the issue counter, but at a different
point in the pipeline. These correspond to the <strong>Int</strong>, <strong>Mem</strong>
and <strong>FP</strong> columns in the tables, and count uops that issues to units of
the given type.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <strong>Units</strong> column is based on finding conflicts when measuring
throughput - if two uops block each other, we can tell they both use the same unit.
(Unfortunately these experiments are not yet automated nor included in the documentation,
so there may be some mistakes.)

<p><strong>Important:</strong> <a href="https://pyodide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pyodide</a> takes time to initialize.
Initialization completion is indicated by a red border around <em>Run all</em> button.</p>

<p>The <em>Earley</em> parsing algorithm was invented by Jay Earley <sup id="fnref:earley1970an" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:earley1970an">1</a></sup> in 1970. It
can be used to parse strings that conform to a context-free grammar. The
algorithm uses a chart for parsing – that is, it is implemented as a dynamic
program relying on solving simpler sub-problems.</p>

<p>Earley parsers are very appealing for a practitioner because they can use any
context-free grammar for parsing a string, and from the parse forest generated,
one can recover all (even an infinite number) of parse trees that correspond to
the given grammar. Unfortunately, this style of parsing pays for generality by
being slightly expensive. It takes \(O(n^3)\) time to parse in the worst case.
However, if the grammar is unambiguous, it can parse in \(O(n^2)\) time, and
all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser">LR(k)</a> grammars in linear time<sup id="fnref:leo1991a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:leo1991a">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is an implementation of Earley parsing that handles the epsilon case as
given by Aycock et al.<sup id="fnref:aycock2002practical" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aycock2002practical">3</a></sup> as well as Leo’s optimizations<sup id="fnref:leo1991a:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:leo1991a">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For a much more complete implementation and
full recovery of parsing forests using iterative solutions,
see our parsing implementation in the <a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Parser.html">fuzzingbook</a>
(See the solved exercises). A very detailed explanation of Earley parsing is
by <a href="https://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing/">Loup Vaillant</a>.
Further, a fast industrial strength Earley parser implementation is
<a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">Marpa</a>.</p>

<p>For this post, we use the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>alphabet</em> is the set all of symbols in the input language. For example,
in this post, we use all ASCII characters as alphabet.</li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>terminal</em> is a single alphabet symbol. Note that this is slightly different
from usual definitions (done here for ease of parsing). (Usually a terminal is
a contiguous sequence of symbols from the alphabet. However, both kinds of
grammars have a one to one correspondence, and can be converted easily.)</p>

    <p>For example, <code>x</code> is a terminal symbol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>nonterminal</em> is a symbol outside the alphabet whose expansion is <em>defined</em>
in the grammar using <em>rules</em> for expansion.</p>

    <p>For example, <code>&lt;term&gt;</code> is a nonterminal in the below grammar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>rule</em> is a finite sequence of <em>terms</em> (two types of terms: terminals and
nonterminals) that describe an expansion of a given terminal.</p>

    <p>For example, <code>[&lt;term&gt;+&lt;expr&gt;]</code> is one of the expansion rules of the nonterminal <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>definition</em> is a set of <em>rules</em> that describe the expansion of a given nonterminal.</p>

    <p>For example, <code>[[&lt;digit&gt;,&lt;digits&gt;],[&lt;digit&gt;]]</code> is the definition of the nonterminal <code>&lt;digits&gt;</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>context-free grammar</em> is  composed of a set of nonterminals and 
corresponding definitions that define the structure of the nonterminal.</p>

    <p>The grammar given below is an example context-free grammar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A terminal <em>derives</em> a string if the string contains only the symbols in the
terminal. A nonterminal derives a string if the corresponding definition
derives the string. A definition derives the  string if one of the rules in
the definition derives the string. A rule derives a string if the sequence
of terms that make up the rule can derive the string, deriving one substring 
after another contiguously (also called parsing).</p>
  </li>
  <li>A <em>derivation tree</em> is an ordered tree that describes how an input string is
derived by the given start symbol. Also called a <em>parse tree</em>.</li>
  <li>A derivation tree can be collapsed into its string equivalent. Such a string
can be parsed again by the nonterminal at the root node of the derivation
tree such that at least one of the resulting derivation trees would be the
same as the one we started with.</li>
</ul>

<p>As before, we use the <a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/">fuzzingbook</a> grammar style.
Here is an example grammar for arithmetic expressions, starting at <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>.
A terminal symbol has exactly one character
(Note that we disallow empty string (<code>''</code>) as a terminal symbol).
Secondly, as per traditional implementations,
there can only be one expansion rule for the <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> symbol. We work around
this restriction by simply constructing as many charts as there are expansion
rules, and returning all parse trees.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>An Earley parser executes the following steps for parsing:</p>

<p>Use <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> as the entry into parsing. At this point, we want to parse the
given string by the nonterminal <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>. The <em>definition</em> of <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>
contains the possible expansion rule that can match the given string. Each
expansion rule can be thought of as a <em>parsing path</em>, with contiguous
substrings of the given input string matched by the particular terms in the
rule.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When given a nonterminal to match the string, the essential idea is to
get the rules in the definition, and add them to the current set of
parsing paths to try with the given string. Within the parsing path, we have
a parsed index which denotes the progress of parsing that particular path
(i.e the point till which the string until now has been recognized by that
path, and any parents of this path). When a rule is newly added, this parsed
index is set to zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We next look at our set of possible parsing paths, and check if any of these
paths start with a nonterminal. If one is found, then for that parsing path to
be completed with the given string, that nonterminal has to be recognized
first. So, we add the expansion rules corresponding to that nonterminal to the
list of possible parsing paths. We do this recursively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, examine the current letter in the input. Then select all parsing paths
that have that particular letter at the parsed index. These expressions can
now advance one step to the next index. We add such parsing paths to the
set of parsing paths to try for the next character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While doing this, any parsing paths have finished parsing, fetch its
corresponding nonterminal and advance all parsing paths that have that
nonterminal at the parsing index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue recursively until the parsing path corresponding to <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> has
finished.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The chart parser depends on a chart (a table) for parsing. The columns
correspond to the characters in the input string. Each column represents a set
of <em>states</em>, and corresponds to the legal rules to follow from that point on.</p>

<p>Say we start with the following grammar:</p>

<!--
############
sample_grammar = {
    '<start>': [['<A>','<B>']],
    '<A>': [['a', '<B>', 'c'], ['a', '<A>']],
    '<B>': [['b', '<C>'], ['<D>']],
    '<C>': [['c']],
    '<D>': [['d']]
}

############
-->
<form name="python_run_form">
<br>
<pre name="python_output"></pre>

</form>
<p>Earley parser produces a table of possible parse paths at each letter index of
the table. Given an input <code>adcd</code>, we seed the column <code>0</code>  with:</p>



<p>where the <code>|</code> represents the parsing index (also called the dot). This indicates
that we are at the starting, and the next step is to identify <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>. After this
rule is processed, the column would contain two more states</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;B&gt; &lt;c&gt;
   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;A&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which represents two parsing paths to complete <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>After processing of column <code>0</code> (which corresponds to input character <code>a</code>), we
would find the following in column <code>1</code> (which corresponds to the input character <code>b</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;A&gt;: a | &lt;B&gt; c
   &lt;A&gt;: a | &lt;A&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | b &lt;C&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | &lt;D&gt;
   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;B&gt; c
   &lt;A&gt;: | a &lt;A&gt;
   &lt;D&gt;: | d
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, the next column (column <code>2</code> corresponding to <code>d</code>) would contain the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;D&gt;: | d
   &lt;B&gt;: &lt;D&gt; |
   &lt;A&gt;: a &lt;B&gt; | c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, column <code>3</code> corresponding to <code>c</code> would contain:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;A&gt;: a &lt;B&gt; c |
   &lt;start&gt;: &lt;A&gt; | &lt;B&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | &lt;b&gt; &lt;C&gt;
   &lt;B&gt;: | &lt;D&gt;
   &lt;D&gt;: | d
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, column <code>4</code> (<code>d</code>) would contain this at the end of processing.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>   &lt;D&gt;: d |
   &lt;B&gt;: &lt;D&gt; |
   &lt;start&gt;: &lt;A&gt; &lt;B&gt; |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how the table or the chart – from where the parsing gets its name: chart parsing – gets filled.</p>

<p>The column contains a set of states. Each column corresponds
to a character (or a token if tokens are used).
Note that the states in a column corresponds to the parsing expression that will
occur once that character has been read. That is, the first column will
correspond to the parsing expression when no characters have been read.</p>

<p>The column allows for adding states, and checks to prevent duplication of
states. Why do we need to prevent duplication? The problem is left recursion.
We need to detect and curtail left recursion, which is indicated by non-unique
states.</p>

<h4 id="nullable">Nullable</h4>

<p>Earley parser handles <em>nullable</em> nonterminals separately. A nullable
nonterminal is a nonterminal that can derive an empty string. That is
at least one of the expansion rules must derive an empty string. An
expansion rule derives an empty string if <em>all</em> of the tokens can
derive the empty string. This means no terminal symbols (assuming we
do not have zero width terminal symbols), and all nonterminal symbols
can derive empty string.</p>

<p>In this implementation, we first initialize the list of first level
nullable nonterminals that contain an empty expansion. That is, they
directly derive the empty string.
Next, we remove any expansion rule that contains a token as these
expansion rules will not result in empty strings. Next, we start with
our current list of nullable nonterminals, take one at a time, and
remove them from the current expansion rules. If any expansion rule
becomes empty, the corresponding nonterminal is added to the nullable
nonterminal list. This continues until all nullable nonterminals
are processed.</p>

March 7, 2021 | https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>I’ve spent the last year <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>, which has included writing firmware for a variety custom circuit boards.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this firmware in Rust, but despite years of experience with that language I still struggled quite a bit.
I eventually got my keyboards working, but it took an embarrassingly long time and wasn’t <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>After repeated suggestions from my much more Rust-and-computing-experienced friend <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>, I rewrote the firmware in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which turned out swimmingly.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising, given that I’d never seen Zig before and it’s a pre-1.0 language written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_kelley">fellow PDX hipster</a> with basically just a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.7.1/">single page of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The experience went so well, in fact, that I now feel just as likely to turn to Zig (a language I’ve used for a dozen hours) as to Rust (which I’ve used for at least a thousand hours).</p>

<p>This, of course, reflects as much about me and my interests as it does about either of these languages.
So I’ll have to explain what I want from a systems programming language in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to explain why I struggled with Rust I’ll have to show a lot of complex code that I’m obviously unhappy about.
My intent here is not to gripe about Rust, but to establish my (lack of) credibility: It’s so you can judge for yourself whether I’m using Rust’s features in a reasonable way or if I’ve totally lost the plot.</p>

<p>Finally, while it risks falling into the dreadfully boring “language X is better than Y” blog trope, I feel that it’d be more helpful to some readers if I explicitly compare Rust and Zig, rather than write a wholly positive “Zig’s great!” article.
(After all, I’d steadily ignored six months of Jamie gushing about Zig because, “that’s great buddy, but I already know Rust and I just want to get my keyboard done, okay?”)</p>

<h2>What I want from a systems language</h2>

<p>I was educated as a physicist and learned programming so I could make data visualizations.
My first languages were PostScript and Ruby (dynamic, interpreted languages) and I later moved to JavaScript so I could draw on the web.
That led me to Clojure (using ClojureScript to draw on the web), where I’ve spent much of my career.</p>

<p>In 2017 I decided to learn a systems language.
Partly this was intellectual curiosity — I wanted to become more familiar with concepts like the stack, heap, pointers, and static types which had remained mucky to me as a web developer.
But mostly it was because I wanted the capabilities that systems languages promised:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To write code that was <em>fast</em>; that could take advantage of how computers actually worked and run as fast as the hardware allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>To write applications that could run in minimal environments like microcontrollers or web assembly where it just isn’t feasible (in time or space) to carry along a garbage collector, language runtime, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My interest was not (and still isn’t) in operating systems, programming language design, or safety (with respect to memory, formal verfiability, modeling as types, etc.).</p>

<p>I just wanted to blink the litle squares on the screen on and off very quickly.</p>

<p>Based on its growing popularity in the open source community and tons of beginners-to-systems-programming documentation, I picked up Rust around version 1.18.</p>

<p>Since then, Rust has undoubtedly helped me achieve those capabilities I was after: I was able to compile it to WASM for a <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/subform-layout">layout engine</a>, build and sell a <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda">fast desktop search app</a> (Rust <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/">shoved into Electron</a>), and compile Rust to an stm32g4 microcontroller to drive a <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_02_robot_update/">track saw robot</a> (I even <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/pull/335">found a typo</a> in the register definitions; the full “hard-mode” embedded debugging experience!).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I still don’t feel <em>comfortable</em> with Rust.
It feels fractally complex — seemingly every time I use Rust on a new project, I run into some issue that forces me to confront a new corner of the language/ecosystem.
Developing my keyboard firmware was no exception: I ran into two problems, and each required learning a completely new language feature.</p>

<p>These problems aren’t really specific to embedded, but they’re representative of the sorts of challenges I’ve run into using Rust over the past three years.</p>

<p>If you want the gory embedded details or understand why I’m writing my own firmware using newfangled languages at all, see my notes on <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>.</p>

<h2>Conditional compilation</h2>

<p>The first challenge I ran into with Rust was getting my firmware to run on hardware varying from 4-button dev-kit PCBs to the left/right halves of a wireless split to a single <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/typical_keyboards.jpg" alt="Various keyboard hardware"></p>

<p>Varying the features of firmware at compile-time is known as “conditional compilation”.
(It needs to be done at compile-time rather than run-time because microcontrollers have limited program space, roughly 10–100kB in my case.)</p>

<p>Rust’s solution to this problem is “features”, which are defined in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>cortex-m</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>nrf52840-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>nrf52833-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>arraydeque</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4"</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>heapless</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.5"</span>

<span>[features]</span>
<span>keytron</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>keytron-dk</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>splitapple</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840"]</span>
<span>splitapple-left</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>
<span>splitapple-right</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>

<span># specify a default here so that rust-analyzer can build the project; when building use --no-default-features to turn this off</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>["keytron"]</span>

<span>nrf52840</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840-hal"]</span>
<span>nrf52833</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833-hal"]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For example, the <code>keytron</code> feature is enabled for a specific keyboard hardware design.
That hardware depends on the <code>nrf52833</code> feature (representing a kind of a microcontroller), which depends on the <code>nrf52833-hal</code> crate (actual code which maps that microcontroller’s peripheral memory addresses to Rust types).</p>

<p>My Rust code can then use attribute annotations to conditionally enable stuff.
E.g., a namespace can import the microcontroller-specific crate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52833"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52840"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>or call the appropriate key scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>unsafe</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>hw</span>::<span>Peripherals</span>::<span>steal</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(any(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>, feature = </span><span>"keytron-dk"</span><span>))]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p0</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>//invert because keys are active low</span>
<span>        </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P0</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P1</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>splitapple</span>::<span>read_keys</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Packet</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Getting this conditional compilation working required learning a lot of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>the attribute annotation conditional mini-language (the <code>any</code> in <code>#[cfg(any(feature = "keytron", feature = "keytron-dk"))]</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>optional = true</code> that must be added to the device crates in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (even though the source is already conditionally requiring them!)</li>
<li>how to enable features when building a static binary (<code>cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "keytron"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have many unresolved questions, too!</p>

<p>At some point I gave up trying to pass device peripherals as function arguments because I couldn’t figure out how to add conditional attributes to types — the “obvious” thing doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>(</span><span>port</span>: <span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P1</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P0</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>There’s a neat embedded framework, <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.4/book/en/preface.html">RTIC</a>, whose main entry point is an <code>app</code> annotation that takes the device crate as an, uh, argument:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[app(device = nrf52833)]</span><span></span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>APP</span>: <span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>//your code here...</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>How does one conditionally vary this argument at compile-time?
I have no idea.</p>

<h2>Types and macros</h2>

<p>Rust also proved challenging even within a single hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Consider scanning a keyboard matrix: If we don’t have enough microcontroller pins to connect each keyboard switch directly to a pin, we can arrange the switches with diodes (one-way valves) into a matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/key_matrix.png" alt="circuit schematic of key matrix"></p>

<p>We then set a single column high and read out the the rows to find state of the switches on that column.</p>

<p>In this example, if we set pin 1.10 high (col0) and then read pin 0.13 (row1) as high, we know that switch K8 is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple in theory, but complex in Rust because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device crates expose hardware peripherals as distinct types</li>
<li>One does not simply compute with distinct types in Rust</li>
</ol>

<p>Say I need to initialize all the columns as output pins.</p>

<p>Doing this for a single pin, say peripheral port P0’s pin 10, is simple enough:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>10</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But my column pins are spread across two ports, so what I <em>want</em> to write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pin</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[(</span><span>P0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

<cap>This video might take a few seconds to load. Please squint for best results :).</cap>

<p>The results of this experiment are not exactly close to my target as you can see, but I thought it was worth a blog post anyway. There was this rough idea I’ve been thinking about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> for a really long time.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if it's possible to use some kind of stochastic algorithm that gives you an initial state which forms legible text after many cycles.</p>— yakinavault (@yakinavault) <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinavault/status/1291586306489761792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>I came across <a href="https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html">an article</a> of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I thought I could do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow “program” a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?</p>

<p>There are other ways of achieving this. One is by placing still life states at specific pixels as described in this <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/38573/paint-a-still-life-or-a-moving-one-draw-an-image-in-the-game-of-life">codegolf question</a>.</p>

<p>What I’m thinking of is to display Mona Lisa for a single frame/generation of ‘non-still’ Game of Life.</p>



<p>I began working on a proof of concept using the hill climbing algorithm. The idea was very simple. Iteratively modify a random 2D Game of Life state until it’s Nth generation looks similar to Mona Lisa. Here’s the full algorithm.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    best_score := infinity
    target := mona lisa with dimensions m x n
    canvas := random matrix of m x n
    best_result := canvas
    do
        modified_canvas := Copy of canvas with a single random cell inverted
        nth_modified_canvas := Run N generations of Game of Life modified_canvas
        Compute a score of how close nth_modified_canvas is with target
        if score &lt; best_score then
        	best_score := score
            best_result := modified_canvas
        canvas := best_result
    while(max_iterations limit passed or best_score &lt; threshold)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hacked up a single core prototype.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>def modify(canvas, shape):
    x,y = shape
    px = int(np.random.uniform(x+1))-1
    py = int(np.random.uniform(y+1))-1
    canvas[px][py] = not canvas[px][py]
    return canvas

def rmse(predictions,targets):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions-targets)**2))

while best_score&gt;limit:
    canvases = np.tile(np.copy(best_seed), (batch_size, 1, 1))
    rms_errors = []
    for canvas in range(len(canvases)):
        canvases[canvas] = modify(states[state], (m,n))
        rmse_val = rmse(target, nth_generation(np.copy(canvases[canvas])))
        rms_errors.append(rmse_val)
    lowest = min(rms_errors)
    if lowest &lt; best_score:
        best_score = lowest
        best_result = canvases[rms_errors.index(lowest)]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hill Climbing works by finding the closest neighboring state to a current state with the least error from a ‘target_state’ (Mona Lisa). The way I find the closest neighbor in every step is to create a copy of the best solution we have so far and invert a random cell. This change is small enough that we don’t risk stepping over any local minima. Also we use root mean square error metric to compare the best state and the target. Other error metrics can be experimented with, but for this problem, I found that RMSE was sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few days of CPU time(!), I was able to obtain something that resembled Mona Lisa after running 4 generations of life.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/lisa_cpu.webm" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>It was reassuring that my algorithm did indeed work, but I realize I made a bunch of mistakes and of course it’s not really scalable for larger images or fast.</p>



<p>Target Mona Lisa against which our random state was compared with was the medium resolution version taken from Wikipedia and converted to monochrome using PIL’s <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('L')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-38-08-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<cap><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg">Taken from wikipedia</a></cap>

<p>When you’re comparing against boolean variables, It’s better that we the target as a binary matrix rather than the whole grayscale range.</p>

<p>In this attempt, I simply rounded these grayscale values to 0s and 1s. This was a mistake as it washed away a lot of details.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-39-11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We could just not round at all and compare against the grayscale version, but there is a better way.</p>



<p>Not every random matrix of 0s and 1s are a valid Game of Life state. States that can never be an nth generation (n&gt;0) of any Cellular Automata are called Garden of Edens. It is almost impossible that our monochrome-rounded Mona Lisa is a valid Game of Life generation. We can only hope to have a solution that’s approximately close to the target.</p>

<p>This is a portion of the 4th generation of the state we just prepared.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-08-47.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Judging by the texture, the way life patterns evolve and from just experimenting with images, I found that comparing against a 1-bit dithered version the target should improve the quality of results.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-04-26.png" alt=""></p>

<cap>1-bit Dithering on Mona Lisa</cap>

<p>Dithered image has a somewhat even distribution of 0 and 1 cells which is somewhat close to what a randomly initialized Game of Life state will look like after a few generations. This property is also maintained when you scale up the image, (which we’ll optimize for soon).</p>

<p>We could do this using PIL (it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a>) using <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('1')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-54-34.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Also you can see from the last result, it’s impossible to get a continuous array of white cells because they will be killed off by the overpopulation rule. Completely dark areas are stable in life. The end result will be a higher contrast, but slightly darkened version of Mona Lisa. At higher resolutions, this effect is not as apparent.</p>



<p>The single core unvectorized version is extremely slow. I tried running this in both my 8th gen Core i7 and the Google Colab CPU machines, but you need to wait for hours/days (depending on target resolution) to get something that resembles the original.</p>

<p>Fortunately, This problem is well suited for parallelization.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/jax/master/images/jax_logo_250px.png" alt=""></p>

<p>JAX is a python library that lets you use a version of numpy and compile it to highly vectorized code that can be run on a GPU/TPU. We need to rework this algorithm for a GPU.</p>

<p>GPUs generally suited to high-throughput type computations that has good data-parallelism. We need to exploit the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture to gain faster execution speeds.</p>

<p>We extrude the <code>target</code>(Mona Lisa) and <code>canvas</code>(initial random state) to 3rd dimension with 3rd dimension being <code>batch_size</code> long tensor loafs (Consider a loaf of bread, with each slice being dithered Mona Lisa).</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-another-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-copy.png" alt=""></p>
<cap>Initial canvas will be completely random(unlike the figure).</cap>

<p>We set <code>best_canvas</code> to the initial random canvas before our hill climbing loop.</p>

<p>Also, for every loop iteration, we need to produce a random tensor called mutator(same shape as <code>target</code>) with this property: Each slice should have all zeros except a single one place at a random location.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-3rd-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>array([[[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 0],
        [0, 1],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 1],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]]])
</code></pre></div></div>

<cap><br>Example mutator with shape 5, 3, 2. batch_size being 5</cap>

<p>The idea is that in every loop, we use the mutator to calculate the nearest set of neighboring states from our best_canvas like this <code>canvas = (best_canvas + mutator)%2</code>.</p>

<p>We compute N generations of game of life across every slice of this modified canvas. Then, we do a 3D RMSE(mean being calculated for the slice only) on the Nth generation canvas against Mona Lisa, and find the slice with the lowest error.
This is slice is then extruded and set to best_canvas and the loop repeats till a finite number of iterations pass.</p>

<p>The notebook for this project is <a href="https://github.com/avinayak/mona_lisa_gol_jax/blob/main/mona_lisa_overdrive.ipynb">available in github</a>. I’ll explain what every block is doing in this section. If you want to see results, skip to the end of the article.</p>

<p>The core of this project, the game of life function is actually taken from <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">this post</a>. Thank you  Bojan Nikolic :). I followed his convention of importing <code>jax.numpy</code> as <code>N</code>, <code>jax.lax</code> as <code>L</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline 
import jax
N=jax.numpy
L=jax.lax
from jax.experimental import loops
from jax import ops
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as onp
import time
from PIL import Image 
from google.colab import files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, <code>wget</code> Mona Lisa</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!wget -O target.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/483px-Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg?download
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not a crazy high res version.It’s only 483px wide.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>batch_size = 100
image_file = Image.open("target.png")
image_file = image_file.convert('1')
lisa = N.array(image_file, dtype=N.int32)
width,height = lisa.shape
lisa_loaf = onp.repeat(lisa[onp.newaxis, :, :,], batch_size, axis = 0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This section dithers Mona Lisa using the and extrudes it to <code>batch_size</code> length.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
canvas_loaf = jax.random.randint(key, (batch_size, width, height), 0, 2, dtype= N.int32) #for tests, initialize random lisa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we’re seeding JAX PRNG(will be explained soon). Also we’re creating the initial random <code>canvas_loaf</code> with integers 0 and 1.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@jax.jit
def rgen(a):
    # This reduction over-counts the neighbours of live cells since it includes the
    # central cell itself. Subtract out the array to correct for this.
    nghbrs=L.reduce_window(a, 0, L.add, (3,3), (1,1), "SAME")-a
    birth=N.logical_and(a==0, nghbrs==3)
    underpop=N.logical_and(a==1, nghbrs&lt;2)
    overpop=N.logical_and(a==1, nghbrs&gt;3)
    death=N.logical_or(underpop, overpop)

    na=L.select(birth,
                N.ones(a.shape, N.int32),
                a)

    na=L.select(death,
                N.zeros(a.shape, N.int32),
                na)
    return na

vectorized_rgen = jax.vmap(rgen)

@jax.jit
def nv_rgen(state):
  for _ in range(n_generations):

<p>Please read <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">B. Nikolc’s post</a> for an explanation for <code>rgen</code> function, which runs a single generation of Game of Life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>The electronics design and fabrication technologies available to motivated individuals today is incredible.
Compared to even just 6 years ago when I <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/phonetron/">made a cell phone</a>, we amateurs now have access to powerful CAD/CAM, low-cost/qty PCB assembly, sorta-usable free EDA software, powerful new embedded languages, and a huge corpus of tacit knowledge on YouTube.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last year exploring this frontier by building wireless mechanical keyboards.
I’ve designed a dozen PCBs, written bare-metal microcontroller firmware in three languages, and commissioned or fabricated myself a ton of parts from aluminum, acrylic, Corian, resin, and fabric:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/keyboards.jpg" alt="A bunch of keyboards"></p>

<p>This page isn’t a tutorial or comprehensive reference on any particular technical topic (though I’ll link to my favorites below).
Rather, it’s a rough diary and reflection on the process.
My hope is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>it gives you a flavor of the overall experience and demystifies the work between “idea” and “functioning prototype”</li>
<li>you’ll discover at least one weird trick that you can apply to your own projects</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have ideas, questions, or think I can help with your creative explorations, feel free to <a href="mailto:kevin@keminglabs.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

<h2>Motivation: Why keyboards?</h2>

<p>I’ll start with a little secret: I don’t care much about keyboards.
Most of my typing is on an 11" Macbook Air from 2013, though my fingers sometimes grace client-provided hardware like Dell laptops, IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads, and newer Macs with those butterfly keyboards that Twitter/HN people got real mad about.
They’re all fine, really.</p>

<p>I first learned of the custom keyboard scene when I convinced a friend to <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/">sell his keyboards for $1,668</a>, but personally never developed any burning desire to acquire (or bring into existence) a keyboard the way my friend and his fans did.</p>

<p>Rather, keyboards appeal to me as a playground of design constraints and technical challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Electrically, keyboards can be wired (drawing power and communicating over USB) or wireless, the latter raising issues of power (selecting batteries, charging and load-sharing circuitry, etc.) and communication (to host devices and between halves of a split keyboard).</p></li>
<li><p>Physically, keyboards have functional size constraints (relating to one’s fingers) but are not subject to serious mechanical loads, so a huge variety of materials and designs can be explored for aesthetic qualities (visual look, key feel, typing sound, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Functionally, keyboard logic can range from simple “press key for character” behavior all the way to elaborate schemes involving multiple layers, tapping keys, special sequences, and even acting as a computer mouse.
(See the open source <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides">QMK firmware</a> for the more popular tricks.)
In addition to its behavior as an input device, a keyboard might also need to handle activities like Bluetooth pairing, signaling battery status, and blinking lights in amusing ways.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While these three domains — electronics, physical design/fabrication, and firmware — are all interesting to me on their own, they become even more fascinating combined together.</p>

<p>It’s immensely satisfying, for example, to find optimizations and novel product functionality by synthesizing knowledge across these disciplines:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricting the hardware to a subset of GPIO pins simplifies the firmware, allowing it to run faster and consume less battery</li>
<li>PCBs can function load-bearing mechanical parts</li>
<li>I’d never heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a>, but after discovering it in my microcontroller’s datasheet I was inspired to develop a “type on your phone by tapping it to the keyboard” quick-switching feature</li>
</ul>

<p>As a problem space, keyboards have a “low floor and high ceiling”.</p>

<p>Finally, as a long-time web developer I’m attracted to the minimalism of embedded hardware products.
Application code running in a web browser is subject to the whims of operating system schedulers, JavaScript JITs, and millions of lines of “system” code running underneath.
Working in such a complex environment, it’s easy to develop a learned helplessness around performance, understandability, and even determinism.</p>

<p>While surely some of this is “grass-is-greener” thinking — yes, I’m aware of cosmic rays, bad solder joints, and thermal variation — I’ve found it an enjoyable change of pace to switch from StackOverflow comments and ever-changing dependencies to bare-metal code (mostly mine) running on physical hardware (also mine) that I can power-cycle instantly, documented by 1000-page datasheets which discuss worst-case timing guarantees in microseconds.</p>

<h2>Retrospective overview + timeline</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_04_keyboards_rethinking_desktops/">original product concept</a> was a “split ergonomic travel keyboard”, but I ended up spending far more time on technical pursuits and process development than I did getting a tightly-scoped product out the door.
However, I managed to complete three functional prototypes:</p>

<h3>v1</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/v1.jpg" alt="V1 keyboard"></p>

<p>My initial focus was on maximally compact mechanical keyboard.
I chose a 5x5 grid (no real reason) of Kailh’s low-profile “Choc” switches and selected components that would fit between the stems of the switches on the PCB backside.</p>

<p>This keyboard involved a lot of personal firsts: Using KiCAD, designing an nRF52-based board and firmware, designing a battery protection and charging circuit (my first use of a P-type MOSFET), drawing footprints for a mid-mount USB connector, etc.</p>

<p>In hindsight I’m amazed it all actually worked on the first revision, and I’m still tickled that I sourced custom, adorable-sized 2 x 13 x 80 mm lithium polymer cells ($200 for 50pcs from <a href="https://www.fentcell.com/">Battsys</a>).</p>

<p>This v1 PCB worked great as a platform on which to develop firmware and refine my understanding of the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and USB protocols  (as exposed via Nordic Semiconductor’s SDK — I’m not yet ambitious enough to bit-bang the radio antenna myself).</p>

<h3>The “Split Apple”</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/split_apple.jpg" alt="Split Apple keyboard"></p>

<p>As soon I paired with a computer and actually tried using the v1 split keyboard , I realized I couldn’t be bothered to re-learn how to type on 50 ortholinear keys.
So, for the next iteration, I decided to just split of Apple’s keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all the necessary keycap sizes were available for Choc switches, so I had to make this one with taller Cherry MX switches.
Rather than wait ~5 weeks for PCBWay assembly, I designed with parts from JLCPCB’s catalog (~1 week turnaround) and soldered myself the nRF52840 dongle.</p>

<p>Because JLCPCB doesn’t assemble USB connectors, the Split Apple also pushed me to implement wireless charging hardware and over-the-air firmware updates (with associated bootloader stack).</p>

<p>By this point I’d found an sign shop here in Taipei that was happy to same-day laser cut acrylic from PDF drawings, and I relied on them extensively for cheap and fast (about $5 per 150mm laser-cut acrylic part) material mock-ups while prototyping the keyboard’s “PCB + acrylic + acrylic” stack-up construction (an idea I stole from this <a href="https://github.com/PancakeLegend/Keyboards/wiki/MiT-Ortholinear:-Assembly-Guide">PancakeLegend keyboard</a>).</p>

<p>Because of the complexity of its layout (not just a 5x5 grid) and stacked-layer construction, the Split Apple forced me to develop a programmatic process to carry designs from <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">keyboard-layout-editor.com</a> (of course that’s a thing) to my PCB and mechanical CAD software.
This process came in quite handy for all subsequent work.</p>

<h3>The Atreus</h3>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/atreus.jpg" alt="Atreus keyboard"></p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/bamboo_atreus.jpg" alt="Atreus keyboard"></p>

<p>In November I got access to a desktop CNC mill and immediately started exploring designs using Corian, an artificial stone-like material typically found in fancy kitchen countertops.
I wanted to explore fabricating a small production run (~50 keyboards?) myself, so I machined <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Phil Hagelberg’s Atreus</a> design as a prototype design, for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyless area in the middle highlights the Corian material and (internally) provides room for standard-sized lithium polymer batteries (a fallback I wanted in case shipping my custom lil’ ones proved too difficult).</li>
<li>A single-piece keyboard is half the assembly/QA work of a two-piece keyboard.</li>
<li>The Atreus design seemed as good as any other on which to ramp up machining capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The production framing encouraged me to optimize my design for manufacture (minimize the number of setups and endmills), develop fixtures, and really dial in the feeds &amp; speeds to maximize the material removal rate.</p>

<p>To keep the Atreus from slipping around a desk, I also investigated several silicone and polyurethane materials and mold design techniques.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<ul>
<li>2020 March: Rust “hello world” LED blinking on nRF52 dongle</li>
<li>April: BLE and USB stack running on nRF52 dongle</li>
<li>May: Design and order first custom PCB (v1)</li>
<li>June: While waiting for v1, make <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/touchpad/">touchpad</a> as an excuse to try JLCPCB’s assembly service</li>
<li>July: Reorganize firmware architecture (have Nordic’s Makefile link to Rust rather than Rust compile Nordic’s code)</li>
<li>August: BLE for split board</li>
<li>Sept: Try to use v1 keyboard, implement layers, keymaps, etc.</li>
<li>Oct: Design full-sized Apple-layout split keyboard and matrix-scanning firmware</li>
<li>Nov: Start pushing on industrial design: laser cut acrylic and metal prototypes, get access to a CNC machine</li>
<li>Dec: Optimize machining and workholding for Corian designs, rewrite firmware in Zig </li>
<li>2021 Jan: Machine Atreus and design its PCB, consider production run, product photography</li>
<li>Feb: Write this retrospective</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a> subreddit loves anodized aluminum.
Yes, amazing material: lightweight, strong, corrosion resistant, etc., etc.
But also sorta boring — I mean, we can already buy those keyboards at the Apple store!</p>

<p>I’m much more interested in materials like leather, cork, Corian, and fabric.</p>

<p>Finding such materials and related tooling was difficult in the first few months after I moved Taiwan (<a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_11_online_retail/">I miss McMaster-Carr</a>), but eventually I managed with a lot of legwork and Google Translate-mediated conversations.</p>

<p>I hoped leather might serve as a non-slip “bottom” that could be stitched around or glued to the v1 PCBs:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/leather_base.jpg" alt="leather bottom"></p>

<p>however the thick, already stiff leather became brittle after laser cutting (also, the smell!) and wasn’t actually very grippy (I suspect the v1 PCB is simply …</p></div></div>

   </p>
   <p id="post-excerpt">
    It seems to be widely accepted that creating a powerful, useful Emacs setup "by hand" is just too much trouble, and you should choose a "distro" like Doom Emacs. But is it really all so bad? If you go the route of "hand-made", will you suffer through endless nights of fixing your setup? The answer is: probably not, but read on for more details! <a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="footnote-ref-1">1</sup></a>
   </p>
   
   <h3 id="why-custom-">
    <a href="#why-custom-">→ </a>Why Custom?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I've got a lot of respect for the various Emacs "distros" out there, but my inclination for DIY as well as for understanding my tools keeps me from going that route. I'd rather spend some time reading and researching than running a prefab setup that's effectively a mystery to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the end of the day I do spend time on my configuration, but it's hardly the part-time job folks make it out to be. And throughout the years, I've learned a substantial amount about how Emacs actually works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Prefab setups are usually nice until you hit some usability wall, or find a leak in the abstraction. Sometimes, you end up putting as much effort into learning your abstraction as you would have put into just learning the thing you tried to abstract. This is why I'm fine with getting my hands dirty with Emacs.
   </p>
   <h3 id="desired-features">
    <a href="#desired-features">→ </a>Desired Features
   </h3>
   <p>
    Before getting into the details of customizing Emacs, it's good to lay out some goals. This will help keep the project focused and prevent you from bloating your setup with things you don't really need. For me, the list looks something like this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Automated, idempotent setup that can be repeated easily
    </li>
    <li>
     Declaratively install packages
    </li>
    <li>
     LSP support for languages that have a supporting server, powerful autocompletion for those that don't
    </li>
    <li>
     Quality-of-life packages and modes
    </li>
    <li>
     A wealth of custom keybindings to make life better
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I personally don't need a full-on project management system, or deep IDE-like integration, but indeed all of that is available if you'd want it. Anyways, with these goals in mind, let's begin to discuss implementation.
   </p>
   <h4 id="automatic--idempotent-setup">
    <a href="#automatic--idempotent-setup">→ </a>Automatic, Idempotent Setup
   </h4>
   <p>
    I want to be able to erase my entire setup, clone it down from a git repo, run Emacs, and be back to where I was before I nuked it all (assuming I've got no local, uncommitted changes). Additionally: I want to have a lockfile-like setup for freezing package versions.
   </p>
   <h5 id="straight-el">
    <a href="#straight-el">→ </a>straight.el
   </h5>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el">straight.el</a> package manager is extremely powerful and allows for extreme reproducibility. It does so via:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Installing packages via git clone versus a tarball or some other archive <a href="#footnote-2"><sup id="footnote-ref-2">2</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Easy integration of customized packages into your own setup, if desired <a href="#footnote-3"><sup id="footnote-ref-3">3</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A lockfile for controlling versions of each package <a href="#footnote-4"><sup id="footnote-ref-4">4</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Integration with <code>use-package</code> (more on that <a href="">later</a>) <a href="#footnote-5"><sup id="footnote-ref-5">5</sup></a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The straight.el bootstrap process allows for a totally self-installing setup. For example, with my configuration you just clone my repo to <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and run Emacs; straight.el bootstraps itself and handles installing everything that I need.
   </p>
   <p>
    Check out the exquisite straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for details about how to get setup. It can do far more than what I've described here, so prepare for a deep dive. <a href="#footnote-6"><sup id="footnote-ref-6">6</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h4 id="declarative-package-installation">
    <a href="#declarative-package-installation">→ </a>Declarative Package Installation
   </h4>
   <p>
    As described above and in the project README, straight.el brings a nice element of reproducibility and control over packages and versions, but to take it even further I handle all package installations and their related config with <a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/">use-package</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Integrating use-package with straight.el does require some configuration; again: see the straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for specifics. I strongly advise giving the project README a good look, it is high-quality documentation. <a href="#footnote-7"><sup id="footnote-ref-7">7</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--installing">
    <a href="#use-package--installing">→ </a>use-package: Installing
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package is extremely powerful and also very simple to use. The straight.el integration is done well too; consider this example for setting up OCaml support:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> tuareg <span>:</span>defer t <span>:</span>straight t<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    The use-package syntax is simple and explicit, but what's happening here?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     I'm installing the <code>tuareg-mode</code> package <a href="#footnote-8"><sup id="footnote-ref-8">8</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling use-package to not load this package until it's needed
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling straight.el to handle the installation
    </li>
    <li>
     By default, straight.el will try to find the package on Github
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Of course that's a very simple example; the use-package readme describes all the various features you can use to tune your setup.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--configuring">
    <a href="#use-package--configuring">→ </a>use-package: Configuring
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package allows configuring packages before and after they are loaded via the <code>:init</code> and <code>:config</code> keyword arguments, respectively.
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> flycheck-status-emoji
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>config
  <span>(</span><span>flycheck-status-emoji-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>

<pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> marginalia
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>init
  <span>(</span><span>marginalia-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <h5 id="use-package--key-binds">
    <a href="#use-package--key-binds">→ </a>use-package: Key Binds
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package also allows for configuring key binds on package load:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> windmove
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>bind
  <span>(</span><span>"M-e"</span> . windmove-left<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-u"</span> . windmove-right<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-k"</span> . windmove-up<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-j"</span> . windmove-down<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    All keybinds then live in your configuration, nicely inside the package declarations themselves.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--hooks">
    <a href="#use-package--hooks">→ </a>use-package: Hooks
   </h5>
   <p>
    The last feature I'm going to discuss is use-package's syntax for hooks:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> html-mode
  <span>:</span>no-require t
  <span>:</span>hook <span>(</span><span>web-mode</span> . skewer-html-mode<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    This should be starting to feel familiar, and again it's nice to have hooks defined with the related packages in an idiomatic way.
   </p>
   <h4 id="language-server">
    <a href="#language-server">→ </a>Language Server
   </h4>
   <p>
    But enough about the awesomeness of straight.el and use-package! One of the main things I wanted when I moved to Emacs was a powerful system for auto-completing code. Emacs has several ways to achieve this, but what I've come to use for almost every mode is <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/">lsp-mode</a> for integrating <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> capabilities into Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm using lsp-mode with almost all of the languages I work with regularly, except Lua. At least for now and for me, the current LSP experience with Lua wasn't as good as using company-mode. I'll definitely revisit that in the future though.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's isnt much else to say that isn't better said on the project documentation: but you can also refer to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~hristoast/dot-emacs/tree/2bb9a7dd5ca8cb281c4f8a9a8bea0508464b5c63/item/lib/h-lsp.el">my configuration</a> for usage examples if desired.
   </p>
   <h4 id="quality-of-life">
    <a href="#quality-of-life">→ </a>Quality Of Life
   </h4>
   <p>
    Aside from that, there are a number of other things I've tuned to make my Emacs experience more to my liking:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the editing area <a href="#footnote-9"><sup id="footnote-ref-9">9</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the mode line <a href="#footnote-10"><sup id="footnote-ref-10">10</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dashboard or "startup page" <a href="#footnote-11"><sup id="footnote-ref-11">11</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Emoji icons for Flycheck status <a href="#footnote-12"><sup id="footnote-ref-12">12</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A handful of helper functions
    </li>
    <li>
     ws-butler, to clean up whitespace in edited files <a href="#footnote-13"><sup id="footnote-ref-13">13</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     "TODO" keyword highlighting <a href="#footnote-14"><sup id="footnote-ref-14">14</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Rainbow parenthesis <a href="#footnote-15"><sup id="footnote-ref-15">15</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Yasnippet for inserting various snippets <a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-ref-16">16</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     And many many more
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Software that's as endlessly customizeable as Emacs allows for all kinds of personal tweaks and touches. Over the year's I've built up my own collection of these and it continues to grow as I learn new things about Emacs.
   </p>
   <h4 id="custom-keybindings">
    <a href="#custom-keybindings">→ </a>Custom Keybindings
   </h4>
   <p>
    Last but not least: most folks will end up wanting to change a key binding at some point. Some go as far as to change the entire paradigm of the keybinds to do something like offer Vim bindings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I keep most of the default Emacs bindings but have changed more than a handful to suit my own needs. Some of these are defined with their related packages, others are just general additions or changes to some default Emacs binding. <a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-ref-17">17</sup></a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you've never done so, I highly encourage taking a look at <code>M-x describe-bindings RET</code>. It's a high-level view of all bindings in your setup.
   </p>
   <h3 id="conclusion">
    <a href="#conclusion">→ </a>Conclusion
   </h3>
   <p>
    This was definitely not written for the unitiated, but I hope it was somewhat useful as a reference to "modding" Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, I'd like to highlight the power and usefulness of managing the editor configuration with Lisp code rather than clicking endlessly through some user interface (the general experience of most other editors).
   </p>
   <p>
    Having Lisp specifically and having it so tightly integrated with Emacs is where the majority of this power comes from. Learning to use it and work with it has been and continues to be a really great experience for me.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I've already written some stuff here. I read it again and wiped it out. It was self-righteous. I hate self-righteous. I could talk about how I hate self-righteous, but I won't, because that would be self-righteous. See? It's hard to blog without being self-righteous.</p>
<p>I mostly wanted a technical blog, with an occasional sprinkle of life in it, like a picture or something. But mostly technical. Tech blogs I like fall into two overlapping categories: informative and entertaining. Sometimes both. Myself, I sure manage to deliver both in the physical world. "Could you see that bug I bump into?" "Yeah, let's look at that, aha, oh,<em> not this code, </em>SHIT, this thing sucks, it's a torrent of shit, man, it's a ShitTorrent we have here. Ewww, this is so disgusting, wait, what do you mean _next==-1, -1 MY ASS, what the hell… um… get_what?! <em>Here's</em> that stupid fucking bug! Have a nice day." See? Informative <em>and </em>entertaining. Sometimes I even gather little audiences looking over my shoulder when I debug, all because profanity is my number one debugging tool. Catches all the bugs in a snap. Trust me.</p>
<p>And that is loads of fun. Trouble is, it's not necessarily the kind of thing people want to get as a response for their next HTTP request. So I think I'll go for "informative" as first priority. If it works out at all. I have this problem with scaling communication. According to my estimations, the quality of my communication is inversely proportionate to the number of people listening (or people that I think are listening). That is, you get 100% face-to-face with nobody around, 50% if there's two of you and so on. All the way down to a whopping 1% of my exceptional rhetorical skills when I think I'm talking to an audience.</p>
<p>With this kind of personality, blogging is pretty hard. Seems like there's no reason to bother, then, but I think I will, because there's stuff in my brain that wants to come out. I recently spoke to a guy with lots of experience, in a broad sense. He's previously told me a couple of times how it would be wiser to keep my mouth shut in certain contexts. But this time, he said, "sometimes it's extremely hard to hold it when I hear something stupid". What I think happens is, our brains are really cells of a larger brain (<a title="shaped like the Internet" href="http://xkcd.com/192/">shaped like the Internet</a>, of course); when stuff wants to come out, they <em>have </em>to let it out.</p>
<p>And this is going to be in English, because writing about programming in Russian or Hebrew, which are my other options, is frigging <em>ridiculous</em>. Fellow Russians and/or Israelis, stop doing that! You ought to put so many English words into your text, like "threads", "namespaces", "closures", that you end up switching languages twice per sentence. Or you can use those <em>moronic </em>translations of such words. That still counts as switching between languages – one good one and one stupid one. Just write the whole thing in English; makes it way more machine-readable, too (you know, vi). And if your English, like mine, is really just a first-order approximation rather than the real thing, it's not <em>your </em>problem – you won't notice. The native English speakers shouldn't have had their ancestors conquer that much land; now, they'll just have to put up with the consequences.</p>

Centre for Disease Control is in favour of delaying second doses to four months after analyzing the data Pfizer submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Harman/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>She told CBC News vaccines are never expected to protect "instantaneously," and that there is always a "grace period" of a couple of weeks that factors into vaccine effectiveness.</p>  <p>"What we found was that they were underestimating the efficacy of the first dose, and rather than the efficacy being 52 per cent, it was actually 92 per cent," she said. "For us, that was a game changer."</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242"><u>finding</u></a> led&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/rapid-response-extended-dose-intervals-covid-19-vaccines-early-rollout-population-protection.html"><u>National Advisory Committee on Immunization&nbsp;(NACI)</u></a>&nbsp;to change the&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;time between doses of COVID-19 vaccines from three weeks to an unprecedented four months.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-update-march-2-1.5933916"><u>B.C. announced it would be delaying second doses</u></a> earlier this week. Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador quickly followed suit.</p>  <p>Canada is now an outlier in the global vaccination rollout. No other country in the world has delayed second doses up to four months, and there is no evidence&nbsp;yet on the long-term&nbsp;effect it could have on immunity to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some scientists&nbsp;say&nbsp;we are venturing into uncharted&nbsp;waters. Others are comfortable with the risk.</p>  <h2>Why is&nbsp;Canada delaying&nbsp;second doses?</h2>  <p>NACI says if second doses are stretched to four months across the country starting this month, close to 80 per cent of Canadians over 16 could get at least one shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine by the end of June.</p>  <p>But Canada's chief science adviser, Mona Nemer, says the decision to delay doses amounted to a "<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nemer-henry-vaccine-interval-experiment-1.5932714"><u>population level experiment</u></a>."</p>  <p>"The comment from the chief science adviser was most unfortunate," said Skowronski. "It did not reflect the careful risk-benefit analysis that went into this decision, and frankly,&nbsp;that is a science and an art to be able to do that."&nbsp;</p>    <p>But aside from a vague reference to "real-world effectiveness" from Canada and other countries in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/rapid-response-extended-dose-intervals-covid-19-vaccines-early-rollout-population-protection.html"><u>NACI's recommendations</u></a>, little evidence has been communicated to Canadians to convince them that the change in vaccine rollout strategy is the right move.</p>  <p>NACI says its decision to delay second doses is based on emerging real-world data from Quebec, B.C., Israel, the U.K. and the U.S. that showed "good effectiveness" of between 70 and 80 per cent from a single dose of the vaccines "for up to two months in some studies."&nbsp;</p>  <p>But it also makes clear that these studies haven't yet collected four months of data on the long-term effectiveness of a single dose, meaning NACI is betting on the "high levels of protection" shown so far.</p>  <p>"It's shown us really good vaccine effectiveness two months after receipt of the first dose&nbsp;and that the effectiveness isn't decreasing over time," Dr. Shelley Deeks, vice-chair of NACI and a lead author of the recommendations, said in an interview.</p>  <p>"After looking at it from all of these angles, and given that we are in a situation of limited supply, the committee came to a strong consensus that we recommend the interval to be extended to four months."&nbsp;</p>    <p>Deeks said NACI&nbsp;will continue monitoring vaccine effectiveness data as it comes out around the world to determine if it needs to further alter its recommendations&nbsp;—&nbsp;meaning another change to Canada's vaccine rollout strategy is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If we need to reassess and revise the recommendations, we will," she said. "But this will allow more Canadians to receive the first dose and have a vaccine in a more timely manner and will have an impact on serious disease."&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'Not based on evidence'</h2>  <p>The move has effectively doubled Canada's doses of COVID-19 vaccines overnight, but some scientists are&nbsp;critical of the move to experiment with delaying intervals.</p>  <p>"The decision is not based on evidence. It's really based on an extrapolation of the evidence," said Brad Wouters, executive vice-president of science and research at the University Health Network in Toronto.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've only been giving this vaccine for two months, so we don't have data out to four months — no one in the world has been waiting four months for a second dose."&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH |&nbsp;The science behind delaying the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccines:</em></strong></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="The science behind delaying the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccines" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1868524611900-metadata-" title="The science behind delaying the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccines"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/204/955/covid-vaccine-dose-guidance-birak-030321.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Federal government scientists have put their support behind delayed second doses of COVID-19 vaccines — which several provinces were already doing — and ongoing research shows some of the benefits of the adapted strategy.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:04</span></span></span></p>  <p>Wouters says it's unclear if the delay will impact the effectiveness of the second dose, and the decision comes with a lot of uncertainty in the months ahead.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Skowronski says once good protection is established, it doesn't suddenly disappear or "fall off a cliff." Instead, protection against a disease wanes gradually after a vaccination, which buys researchers time to "re-evaluate the optimal timing of the second dose."&nbsp;</p>  <p>She said that longer intervals between a first and a second dose of a vaccine are generally preferred&nbsp;because shorter intervals can interfere with the immune boost response and longer intervals are often associated with ultimately higher antibody levels.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Alyson Kelvin, an assistant professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax and virologist at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology, says the clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines ran with the shortest time frame possible so they could get data out quickly, but previous studies on other vaccines show longer intervals are generally better.</p>  <p>Skowronski says it's unclear why&nbsp;Pfizer went&nbsp;with a three-week interval for&nbsp;their clinical&nbsp;trials, but it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;because&nbsp;they didn't expect to have such good protection with the first dose.</p>  <p>"The only reason to go with a shorter interval is if you don't get good protection with the first dose, and a second dose administered sooner could top it up a lot," Skowronski said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"That's a scenario that we are not dealing with here.

<p>Hey guys, Welcome back, in this module we are going to talk about Why should I learn Python? The most frequently asked query or question by ourselves, so letâ€™s see the solution of this query in detail in this module.</p>

<p>As we know <a href="https://usemynotes.com/introduction-to-python/">Python</a> is in high demand in todayâ€™s industry just because of its features and characteristics. Most of the big companies are using python only to work for their businesses.</p>
<p>Then as a beginner, it is a very critical question which generally all of us asked by ourselves, and i.e., Why? Just because it is in high demand or just because most of the companies are using it in order to grow and work faster and smarter but then also one question arises and i.e., Why is it in high demand?</p>

<p><img src="https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-1024x597.jpg" alt="Why Should I learn Python" width="1024" height="597" srcset="https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-300x175.jpg 300w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-768x448.jpg 768w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-150x88.jpg 150w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-696x406.jpg 696w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-1068x623.jpg 1068w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-720x420.jpg 720w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" wp-image-676="" should="" learn="" 1024w,="" 300w,="" 768w,="" 150w,="" 696w,="" 1068w,="" 720w,="" 1200w&quot;="" 1024px)="" 1024px&quot;="" title="Why Should I learn Python? 1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20597'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-300x175.jpg 300w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-768x448.jpg 768w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-150x88.jpg 150w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-696x406.jpg 696w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-1068x623.jpg 1068w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-720x420.jpg 720w, https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python.jpg 1200w" data-lazy-src="https://usemynotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/why-should-i-learn-python-1024x597.jpg"></p>
<p>So, letâ€™s see some of the key points that make Python a better language and give the answer to this frequently asked question.</p>
<h3>Easy and Simple to Learn</h3>
<p>Python is a beginner-friendly language, i.e., if you donâ€™t know anything about programming language and you want to learn python then you can start learning it from Python. Python is very easy as it does not include complex syntax and allows to do the thing in a more simple way. And because of its simplicity, it is known as Readable Programming Language.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>Python is a versatile language as it has covered almost all the fields from developing small software to making huge databases, python is everywhere. It fits into each and everything you want and all this makes python a great language of choice. Thus, by investing your time in learning python, you can make you prepare for different types of job roles in the industry.</p>
<h3>Bunches of Libraries available</h3>
<p>Once you accelerate your learning towards python, you will come across different types of libraries available which have their unique and amazing work, there are a lot of libraries available that need to be imported before use in your python code. For example, for working with mathematical functions you need to import a math library, for working with arrays and files there are NumPy and Pandas and likewise much more available.</p>
<h3>Flexibility and Scalability</h3>
<p>Python is a highly flexible and scalable language. It takes less time to code and by writing just a few lines of code you can create your own applications and python just offers this. Industries expect the same thing that their application should be developed in a shorter time and should be more efficient. Even the developers want the same.</p>
<h3>Portability and extensibility</h3>

<p>Python is a portable language. This invokes the cross-language platform feature that can be easily executed in any platform whether it be Windows, Linux, Solaris, etc. Code written in Python can be integrated with other languages also like java, .net, etc.</p>
<h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
<p>Python helps in developing a lot of applications and therefore it also helps in developing GUI-based applications using the Tkinter library. Also, it helps in creating games using the Pygame module.</p>
<h3>Web development</h3>
<p>Various Python frameworks help in web development like Flask, Django is all the latest and popular frameworks of python, which helps in web development in lesser time.</p>
<h3>Data Science</h3>
<p>Python has become a very important tool in data science. It helps in the analysis of data, cleaning of data, and performing various types of work with data, and comes up with a proper result. There is a huge amount of data generated every single day by different companies.</p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Machine Learning is booming in todayâ€™s industry and python is the most important thing in machine learning. Most of the industry uses this concept for making predictions like where the sales of a particular product are more, where they should expand their business or where they can attract their customers, etc.</p>
<h3>Amazing Salary</h3>
<p>As a <a href="https://usemynotes.com/how-to-become-a-python-developer/">python developer</a>, you can make a huge amount of money. People are getting salaries more than expected as a developer, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineers, and many more. Over the few years, python has shown a tremendous amount of growth in many IT industries and many developers are also taking advantage of the same.</p>
<p>So, I hope, you all got the answer to this question and also Why you should start learning Python and choose the same as a career option and also what python can make you in <a href="https://usemynotes.com/future-of-python/">near future</a> There are multiple advantages of python which makes beginners start python learning as their first programming language.</p>
<p>If you also want to continue your journey with python, then stay connected with us for many more amazing modules. Until then Happy Coding, Keep Learning.</p>

      <h2>



   Visual design updates that are more than skin&nbsp;deep

</h2>
    

    






    


  </header>

  <section>
    <p>When a new major version of some piece of software is released, there is often an immediate focus put on visual changes. If there aren’t a ton of new and shinies, social media will inevitably be filled with words like “stale,” “old,” and “outdated.” This has become especially true for elementary OS, whose visual design hasn’t really changed all that much over the years. At elementary, we tend to avoid making changes for the sake of change. We’re very skeptical about design trends, and do our best to create things that feel a bit more “evergreen.” After all, “Good design is long lasting” and this allows us to focus more on refining than constantly reinventing. We also have a third-party developer community to think about, and making sweeping visual changes means that the nearly 200 apps in AppCenter will have to be updated and tested to make sure they still look as intended. So, when we decided to work on the look and feel for elementary OS 6, we wanted to approach things with a lot of intentionality, avoiding trends and focusing on setting the stage for the next several years.</p>



<p>App developers rely on pre-made widgets to do a lot of the heavy lifting and provide good default styles when making their apps. In addition to the widgets provided by GTK, we also ship our GTK companion library Granite that makes replicating common elementary design patterns a breeze. In elementary OS 6, we’re also making heavy use of Handy—a library that was originally developed by Purism for mobile interfaces but has now become a core part of the GNOME app development platform on the desktop. Thanks to Handy, we have two major, obvious visual design improvements that developers can adopt.</p>



<p>We’ve long had plans to modernize the Granite Avatar widget. A continual problem we’ve faced is that many people just don’t set an avatar for their user account. As a consequence, we need a more meaningful fallback design that allows avatars to be distinct and useful in apps like Mail or in System Settings. As it turns out, the folks behind Handy had the same thoughts and the work was largely already done. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exalm">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> was very helpful and gracious in implementing changes in Handy to achieve the exact style we wanted, and I’m happy to say that we now have much more colorful interfaces in elementary OS 6 thanks to Handy Avatar, even if people don’t set avatar images.</p>

<p>The other obvious change is more rounded bottom window corners. This seems like something that would be simple, but is actually not possible in vanilla GTK3. In elementary OS 5, we used clever workarounds for specific cases to give dialogs and other flat windows rounded corners all the way around. But in elementary OS 6, we can now have rounded bottom corners even in complex cases like Camera, thanks to Hdy.Window. It’s a small thing, but it definitely makes the whole UI feel just a bit more polished.</p>

<figcaption>Hey, it's me! But more importantly, the bottom corners are rounded here</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>

<p>The default typefaces in elementary OS have also been changed for the first time since our initial brand work. Instead of Open Sans with Raleway for headers, we’ve unified on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>: a new, modern typeface specifically designed for use in user interfaces on computer screens. The designer, Rasmus Andersson, actively updates Inter and has been very responsive on GitHub. He’s even weighed in on our use of Inter in elementary OS, and his feedback has led to changes in the weights we use for various headers.</p>

<figcaption>Inter being used on Granite Demo's welcome screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve also revisited the default font rendering settings, opting for grayscale anti-aliasing over RGB; this addresses some issues we’ve seen with ghosting/leaking of colors around text, especially visible when using transparency. You’ll find that in general, text is bolder, higher contrast, and more legible in elementary OS 6.</p>

<h2 id="iconography">Iconography</h2>

<p>The visual style for our icons has remained largely unchanged, with more focus put on internal consistency. You’ll notice subtle improvements such as a more consistent use of our color palette, plus more gender-neutral depictions of a “user” in places like System Settings.</p>

<figure>

  </picture>
<figcaption>New user accounts icon</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A long outstanding issue has been wrangling all the different styles of arrows that we’ve used over the years. There are hundreds of arrow icons in the elementary icon set, used across many different contexts. We provide both full color and flat, symbolic icons and in a range of different sizes. There are even different kinds of arrow tails depending on context, or no tail at all. In elementary OS 6, we have one new shape to rule them all and we’ve given arrows more rounded corners.</p>

<figure>
  <picture>
    <img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/look-and-feel-changes-coming-elementary-os-6/arrows.svg">
  </picture>
  <figcaption>A small portion of the new arrow icons</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In arrows with curved tails, such as in Mail tool icons, the area under the curve is larger, making the shape more recognizeable at small sizes or for folks with less acute vision. We’ve also reduced busy overlap and improved separation in symbolic icons, which now match their full color counterparts much more closely.</p>

  </picture>
  <figcaption>New Mail tool icons</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re rounding out corners and using bolder shapes in other places as well. The new media controls icons for example feel much more weighty, and the lightning bolt symbol used on power icons is more distinct. Historically, going into more detail hasn’t been as important on LoDPI displays, but the new shapes really shine on displays with more pixels available.</p>

  </picture>
  <figcaption>New power and media controls icons</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="stylesheet">Stylesheet</h2>

<p>One recurring bit of feedback that we’ve received is that in general, the stylesheet in elementary OS 5 is somewhat low contrast. Low contrast can make it hard to read text for visually impaired users, but it can also be a large problem on lower quality displays. Contrast between widgets and their backgrounds can also help clearly define different parts of an application, and especially which of those parts are interactive. Addressing these concerns is part of our larger project to make elementary OS 6 more accessible by default, which we’ve written about previously.</p>



<p>To ensure we achieve the desired contrast, we created a design system built on UI levels. With a little bit of Sass magic, we can style widgets by picking a background level—such as 0 for inputs or 4 for toolbars—and then overlaying a white gradient and adding a shadow—which also comes in various levels. The overall result is a style that is a bit flatter on the surface of each layer, but overall more consistent in its use of depth, and with much more consistent and expressive use of shadows between layers.</p>

<figcaption>Files with different levels as shown in inputs, sidebars, tabbars, actionbars, and headerbars</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another place for more clear differentiation is in widget states. Interfaces are interactive: they can be selected, disabled, focused, or pressed. We started some work towards more clearly differentiated states in elementary OS 5 when we redesigned checkboxes, and in elementary OS 6 this work has extended to other interactive widgets like text entries and buttons. Disabled widgets, for example, are much more obviously darker than the default UI level, and are intentionally lower contrast than enabled widgets.</p>

<p>Something we knew we needed to consider from very early on was a path towards making elementary OS feel more personal without breaking custom styles in apps. We know that many of our users are currently using custom CSS, but that it often leads to breakage and disappointment. In elementary OS 6, we provide 10 possible accent colors to choose from. Combined with the dark style, you can get a much more unique look for your operating system without having to worry about apps behaving incorrectly. The dark style follows all the same principles as outlined above including UI levels, using higher contrast, etc. And we’re still exploring more ways to expose your chosen accent color in ways that feel fun and personal.</p>

</figure>

<p>Focus styles are still a work in progress, but the goal here is to make much more bold use of color and to make the keyboard focus location much more obvious. We’ve also revisited selected states and suggested action button styles to make sure that we’re clearly differentiating between someone’s strawberry accent color and destructive action buttons. Instead of using white text on a colored background, we now use a much subtler style that is ultimately higher contrast as well. It also works much better for accent colors, custom brand colors in apps, or other places where we want to use color such as Calendar events.</p>

<p>We also hear regularly from users who have displays that sit in that uncomfortable zone between 1× and 2× UI scaling. While we’re still not offering traditional fractional scaling in elementary OS, we have been working on an improved scalable UI solution. In elementary OS 5, people who opted to change the default text size were left with an awkwardly spaced UI with large text, but small controls. In elementary OS 6, we now scale default widgets spacing, corner radii, etc. with text size, eliminating a lot of that awkwardness. It’s not quite perfect, but it will make elementary OS much more legible for more people without incurring the performance penalty associated with traditional fractional scaling. And we’re happy to have a more first-class experience for those who need larger text.</p>

<strong>Linux Security Hardening and Other Tweaks</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 08/18/2020,
by <a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a>

</p><p>
This page lists the changes I make to a vanilla install of Arch Linux
for security hardening, as well as some other changes I find useful.
While Arch is my target platform, most of the changes will work on
any Linux system that's reasonably up to date.

</p><p>
I typically favor security over performance. You may also see suggestions
merely to make something more useful or shave precious seconds off
a wait time. It's not a one-size-fits-all setup, but hopefully certain
pieces of it will be useful.

</p><p>
Arch is worth considering for a few reasons:

</p><ul>
<li><strong>The install size:</strong> The base install is relatively minimal
    compared to a "prebuilt" distro like Fedora or Mint. This lets me focus
    on adding just what I want, rather than constantly trying to strip out
    things I don't need.
</li><li><strong>The kernel:</strong> A common misconception about the Linux
    kernel is that it's secure, or that one can go a long time without
    worrying about kernel security updates. Neither of these are even
    remotely true. New versions of Linux are released almost every week,
    often containing security fixes buried among the many other changes.
    These releases typically
    <a href="https://youtu.be/5PmHRSeA2c8?t=4075">don't make explicit
    mention</a> of the changes having security implications. As a result,
    many "stable" or "LTS" distributions don't know
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200623161340/https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/23/2">which commits</a> should be
    backported to their old kernels, or even that something needs backporting
    at all. If the problem has a public CVE assigned to it, maybe your distro
    will pick it up. Maybe not. Even if a CVE exists, at least in the case
    of Ubuntu and Debian especially, users are often left with kernels full
    of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/linux">known holes</a>
    for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210228153347/https://blog.frizn.fr/linux-kernel/cve-2020-14381">months at a time</a>.
    Arch doesn't play the backporting game, instead
    opting to provide the newest stable releases shortly after they come out.
</li><li><strong>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System">Arch Build System</a></strong>:
    Having enjoyed the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ports_collection">ports</a>
    system of <a href="https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults.html">FreeBSD</a>
    and <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> for a long time, the ABS
    has been a pleasure to use. It makes building/rebuilding packages easy.
    It makes updating packages easy. It shows how things are actually built
    and with what options. This BSD-borrowed concept makes interacting with
    the package system simple and intuitive.
</li></ul>

Now on to how I set things up.

<h2 id="disks">Disk Layout</h2>

This section contains a few tips to consider during your initial disk layout
creation. The concepts should apply to any distrbution.

<p>
To start, consider using
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">full disk encryption</a>
along with a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM">Logical Volume Manager</a>
setup. Disk encryption protects data at rest, while LVM allows for some
flexibility that can be quite useful. A simple disk layout might look like
this:

</p><ul>
<li><code>/dev/sda1</code> (a small, unencrypted
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition">EFI System Partition</a>,
FAT32)
mounted at <code>/efi</code> (assuming this is
a PC with UEFI, otherwise not needed)
</li><li><code>/dev/sda2</code> (a small, unencrypted ext4 partition)
mounted at <code>/boot</code>.
</li><li><code>/dev/sda3</code> (using the rest of the drive space)
as the encrypted
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt">LUKS</a> container
for LVM
</li></ul>

Splitting up the logical volumes for different mount points provides some
benefits, including the ability to set mount flags on specific directories.
Consider creating separate logical volumes for <code>/</code>,
<code>/var</code>, and <code>/home</code> in the install. For a typical
desktop, you probably want to give <code>/home</code> most of the disk space.
The other two don't need much unless there's a specific use case in mind.
25GB and 8GB are used in this example. If you need to have a huge database
in <code>/var</code> or something, make adjustments accordingly.

<p>
There are a lot of user-writable directories in Linux, each one providing
an opportunity for attackers to execute their own binaries.
Once the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab">fstab</a>
file is created, add the <code>noexec</code> and <code>nodev</code> flags
to <code>/var</code> and <code>/home</code>. Doing so will disallow execution
of binaries on these mount points, as well as prevent interpreting character
or block special devices on them. Two temporary filesystems (<code>/tmp</code>
and <code>/dev/shm</code>) can also be locked down with the same flags by
adding the following:

</p><pre># /etc/fstab
[...]
tmpfs /tmp     tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,size=1G,mode=1777 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,size=1G 0 0
</pre>

Adjust the <code>1G</code> size limit value as desired.

<p>
Once booted into the finished installation, it should look something like this:

</p><pre># <strong>lvs</strong>
  LV   VG   Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  home lvm  -wi-ao---- 189.12g                                                    
  root lvm  -wi-ao----  25.00g                                                    
  var  lvm  -wi-ao----   8.00g                                                    
# <strong>mount | egrep '(lvm|/tmp|shm)' | sort</strong>
/dev/mapper/lvm-home on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime)
/dev/mapper/lvm-root on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mapper/lvm-var on /var type ext4 (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nodev,noexec,size=1048576k)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=1048576k)
</pre>

Another user-writable directory to consider is <code>/run</code>, specifically
the <code>/run/user/$UID</code> directories that systemd spawns when someone
logs in, but their transience is
<a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-February/028429.html">annoying</a>
and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/436012/">complicated</a>.
I have yet to find the perfect solution there that won't break other things.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/FUSE">FUSE</a> is another way
for non-root users to create new mount points and execute binaries. If FUSE
functionality isn't needed, the kernel module can be
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_module#Blacklisting">blacklisted</a>.

<hr>

<h2 id="pacman">Pacman</h2>

Package managers usually don't need much additional configuration.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman">Pacman</a>, the one
Arch uses, is no different. My recommendation for any package manager is
simply to make sure that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200528161634/https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2018/02/21/attacks-against-secure-apt-repositories/">only HTTPS mirrors</a>
are used.

<pre># /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Server = <strong>https</strong>://example.com/[...]/$repo/os/$arch
</pre>

Check the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/https/">mirrorlist
generator</a> to see a list of TLS-capable servers near you.

<p>
Using an HTTPS mirror with Pacman is especially important because it
<a href="https://security.archlinux.org/package/pacman">doesn't validate</a>
the package database files and it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation">runs everything as root</a>.
HTTPS doesn't mitigate either of these problems, but it is one line of defense
against a MITM attack. I hope the developers will make fixing these two
security issues a priority for the project soon. Other package managers
have been doing it the right way for a long time.

</p><hr>

<h2 id="kern">Kernel Options</h2>

The
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/linux-hardened/">linux-hardened</a>
kernel package in Arch includes some compile-time security improvements
that can't be set at runtime.
If your distribution doesn't have a package for it, applying the
<a href="https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened/releases">patchset</a>
to upstream sources and building your own kernel is pretty easy. If you go
that route, have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check">kconfig-hardened-check</a>
script for more compile-time settings to consider.

<p>
The only issue I've found with linux-hardened is that it's often outdated.
Upstream Linux development moves quickly, so out-of-tree patches will always
require extra work to maintain. Why the (relatively small) patches aren't
upstreamed is unknown to me. There are times when linux-hardened is lagging
multiple versions behind the latest kernel, thus
<a href="https://archive.is/GDFgs">missing out</a> on many
important security fixes. In such a situation, the user must choose between
a more secure kernel with known vulnerabilities and a less secure kernel
with fewer known vulnerabilities. Not a great situation.

</p><p>
Runtime configuration of the kernel can be done in a number of ways.
Desired flags may be passed on startup in the form of
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters">kernel parameters</a>,
of which there is an
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt">extensive list</a>.
Parameters are usually passed by the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bootloader#Boot_loader">bootloader</a>, so
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters#Configuration">configuration details</a>
vary depending whether the system uses
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB">GRUB</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot">systemd-boot</a>,
or something else.

</p><p>
The following options, split up into categories, are worth considering for
security improvements:

</p><pre>l1tf=full,force
spec_store_bypass_disable=on
spectre_v2=on
</pre>

These are addtional mitigations for certain CPU security flaws.
While the <code>mitigations=auto</code> option is used by default in upstream
Linux, some of the mitigations it enables have been "toned down" for
performance reasons.
Examples of this include the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadow_(security_vulnerability)">L1TF</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling">Microarchitectural Data Sampling</a>
vulnerabilities, which can't be fully mitigated unless HyperThreading
is disabled.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_Store_Bypass">Speculative Store Bypass</a>
vulnerability is only partially mitigated by default, with applications being
allowed to opt-in for protections via prctl or seccomp.
Finally, we enable all mitigations (including those against userspace) for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre V2</a>.

<pre>apparmor=1
lsm=lockdown,yama,apparmor
lockdown=<span color="#ff0000"><strong>XXX</strong></span>
</pre>

These enable the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AppArmor">AppArmor</a>, 
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt">Yama</a>,
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200525014035/https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown</a>
features, with the lockdown mode left for the reader to choose.
Valid options are <code>integrity</code> and <code>confidentiality</code>,
both described briefly
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security#Kernel_lockdown_mode">here</a>.
Replace <code><strong><span color="#ff0000">XXX</span></strong></code> with
whichever you see fit, or omit this option entirely if the feature isn't
wanted.

<p>
For what it's worth, running in <code>confidentiality</code> mode on my
desktop hasn't caused any problems. Your mileage and use case may vary.
Lockdown will break suspend-to-disk and any out-of-tree kernel modules
like ZFS, as well as
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support">DKMS</a> modules.

</p><pre>init_on_alloc=1
init_on_free=1
page_alloc.shuffle=1
slab_nomerge
vsyscall=none
</pre>

This group will instruct the kernel to fill newly allocated pages and heap
objects with zeroes, fill freed pages and heap objects with zeroes, tell the
page allocator to randomize its free lists, disable merging of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation">slabs</a>
with similar size, and disable
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200526182112/https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscalls</a>
due to their history of making exploits easier.
All five options are all set by default when using the linux-hardened kernel.

<pre>slub_debug=F
</pre>

This enables sanity checks in the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/slub.txt">SLUB allocator</a>.
Two other flags to consider for non-hardened kernels are <code>Z</code>
(redzoning, to detect when a slab is overwritten past its real size) and
<code>P</code> (to enable poisoning on slab cache allocations).

<p>
The full list of kernel parameters to be used must be specified on a single
line, separated by spaces, in the bootloader's config file. An example for
GRUB might look like this:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>‍<strong>A few personal thoughts on why self-supervised learning will have a strong impact on AI. From recent NLP to computer vision papers.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>This is not a prediction but rather a summary of personal findings and trends from research and industry. </p><p>‍</p><p>First, let’s discuss the difference between self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Whether there actually is a difference between the two is still an open discussion.<br><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong> is the idea of models learning without any supervision. Clustering algorithms are often an example of unsupervised learning. There is no supervision or training involved on how clusters are formed (at least not for simple methods such as K-Means).<br>In <strong>self-supervised learning</strong>, we use the data itself as a label. We essentially turn unsupervised learning into supervised learning by leveraging something called a proxy task. A proxy task is different from the downstream or model task because we are not interested in the proxy itself. </p><p>‍</p><p>In <strong>NLP</strong> popular methods such as Googles <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf" target="_blank">BERT, 2019</a> use a pre-training procedure where the model would predict missing words within a sentence or the next sentence based on the current sentence. We can create a sentence with a missing word by simply removing a single word from it. Now the ground truth information (our label) is the missing word. We can train the model in a self-supervised way.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/60070083605e885ce378d565_1*PyNyC1q8d5nY7PoqaQZjbQ.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image from the original BERT paper</figcaption></figure><p>In <strong>computer vision</strong>, we can apply the very same technique to train a model. We take an image and remove part of it (we essentially color it with a single color). The task of the model is to predict the missing pixels (we call this image inpainting). Since we have access to the original image and the missing pixels (ground truth) we can train the model in a supervised way. The paper <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Pathak_Context_Encoders_Feature_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting, CVPR, 2016</a> is an example of such a self-supervised training procedure using inpainting. Unfortunately, this approach in computer vision doesn’t work that well. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/600700831fbe4b9d4b33d8d0_1*6Cm9WFWYQtzmW-xuPwd_fA.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>From original paper Context Encoders. The illustration shows how the model has to reconstruct the white area in the image. To fulfill the task it needs to understand the context (needs to learn good representations).</figcaption></figure><p>Newer methods use image augmentations. A single image would go twice through an augmentation pipeline. We end up with two new versions of the original image (we call them views). If we do the same for multiple images we can train a model to find the pairs which belong to the same original image (before augmentation). We essentially learn the model to be invariant to whatever augmentation we choose.</p><p>‍</p><p>Now, let’s have a look at the advantages self-supervised learning can bring to the world of AI.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Lifelong Learning</h3><p>When we talk about AI we all think about some smart system learning over time and improving itself. Unfortunately, this is quite difficult. Supervised learning systems require new labels for new data to be trained on. Improving the systems require continuous re-labeling and re-training. <br>However, using self-supervision we don’t require human labels anymore. There has been some great work into that direction from <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/" target="_blank">Alexey Efros Lab</a> like the following paper using self-supervised learning for adapting to new environments in reinforcement learning: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf" target="_blank">Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction, ICML, 2017</a> </p><p>‍</p><h3>Data Labeling</h3><p>Supervised learning requires ground-truth data. We call them labels or annotations and in domains such as computer vision, they are mostly generated by humans. A single label can cost between a few cents and up to multiple dollars. It all depends on how much time the annotation task takes and how much expertise is required. Whereas lots of people can draw a bounding box around a car and a pedestrian fewer can do the same for medical images.<br>Self-supervised learning can help to reduce the required amount of labeling. On one hand, we can pre-train a model on unlabeled data and fine-tune it on a smaller labeled set. A popular example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709.pdf" target="_blank">A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, ICML 2020</a>. Btw. the last author of this paper is no one else than Turing Award winner Geoffrey Hinton. Another way to help with labeling efficiency is that we can use the obtained features from a self-supervised model to guide the selection process of which data to label. One approach is to simply pick the data samples which are diverse and not similar. We do this at <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>I hope you got an idea of how self-supervised learning works and why there is a good reason to be excited about it. If you’re interested in self-supervised learning in computer vision don’t forget to check out our <a href="https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly" target="_blank">open-source Python framework for self-supervised learning on GitHub</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>Igor, co-founder<br><a href="https://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly.ai</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

  <article>
    

<p>Through a series of examples, this article deals with limitations of classic controllers and control strategies in 
<em>Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning</em> (HVAC) systems, and draws a comparison with <em>intelligent agents</em> (supported
by artificial intelligence techniques) and their benefits. As such, we take as a basis of comparison a common HVAC
system type (<em>Variable Air Volume</em> or VAV) and show where classic control technics fall short while intelligent agents
bring in better performance.</p>

<h2 id="hvac-components-control-optimization-context">HVAC components control optimization: context</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/energyusage/">US Energy Information Agency</a>, HVAC
systems were responsible for not less than 40% of energy consumption in commercial buildings in 2012. With such a 
significant footprint, everyone has an interest in optimizing their control and operations.</p>

<p>Below diagram gives a simplified description of such HVAC system, of <em>VAV</em> type, as we find in many buildings in US,
Europe and Asia since 1980 onwards. This type of system, as its name suggests, varies the amount of air to meet heating,
cooling and air renewal demands in building spaces. While its installation cost is higher than previous generation 
(namely, <em>Constant Air Volume</em>), it has replaced it advantageously since it brings better comfort guarantees and less
energy expenses. We encounter this in medium to large size buildings mainly, in every kind of facilities.</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/ncc_hvac_schematics.svg" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 1: simplified schematics of a typical Variable Air Volume (VAV) HVAC system, with central mechanical cooling and hot water reheat</i></center>


<p>As we can observe, a VAV is a centralized system: most of the ventilation, cooling and heating happens in one place, and
this requires to be configured and operated to meet all demands. By intuition, one can already imagine the challenges
that such systems face: a single (or a handful of) equipment of any kind must satisfy potentially dozens of open spaces,
cell offices, meeting rooms, … This requires proper sizing, configuration and control.</p>

<p>To do so, HVAC industry relies on processes, hardware and techniques that, for some of them, are decades-old. Given
investment costs to design and promote new equipment or control techniques, but also to replace those already installed,
there is some inertia, legitimate to some extent. But as we’ll discuss in next sections, optimisation or removal of
existing limitations don’t require many capital expenditure anymore. Modern, software-based approaches can
bring dramatic improvements without a full-fledged retrofit.</p>

<h2 id="shortcomings-of-classic-controllers-in-hvac-systems">Shortcomings of classic controllers in HVAC systems</h2>

<p>To understand what can go wrong, let’s begin our short study by describing classic control systems and strategies in
HVAC systems, backed by concrete examples of sub-optimal control in an actual building.</p>

<h3 id="a-classic-controller-case-study-proportional-integral-derivative">A classic controller case study: Proportional-Integral-Derivative</h3>

<p>Proportional-Integral-Derivative, or <em>PID</em>, are the three calculation terms employed in this type of controller to
obtain a process control loop. For many decades, it’s the go-to in industrial processes, and HVAC systems are no
exception.</p>

<p>However, they have known limitations, that are common to all PID controllers or more specific to HVAC-related processes.
Below we summarize some of them, in order to build a first intuition on what could be optimized.</p>

<h4 id="typical-limitations-of-a-pid">Typical limitations of a PID</h4>

<p>Let’s take an example with an actual PID controller used to vary supply air fan speed in a VAV system. A common control
strategy is to make the most-open VAV box damper position reach 90%. So this PID has the maximum of all dampers position
as input, a fixed set point of 90%, and outputs fan speed.</p>

<p>The first limitation is intrinsically coming from how PID works: it requires a margin in the set point to produce stable
results when the controlled process is mechanical (e.g. fan speed can’t go higher than 100% or lower than 0%). When the 
limit of process range is reached, errors accumulate but the controlled process can’t go further in the same direction. 
This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_windup">integral windup</a>. When it comes to fan control, a 
typical strategy is then to fix the set point below range limit, usually 90%.</p>

<p>The second limitation is also inherent to PID internals: a large change in set point or in input value will produce
excessive change in the output (mostly due to derivative part of the PID: on a large change, derivative term will be
very large). A common solution is to use ramping either on set point or on PID input (in some “enhanced” controllers).
This produces very slow responses, on a fan start-up that means a long delay before reaching the set point. This can be
observed on below chart, where it takes more than 30min for the PID to reach the set point.</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/pid_fan_rampup.png" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 2: supply fan speed controlled by a PID and most-open VAV damper position (used as PID input) show a slow 
ramp-up of about 30min</i></center>

<p>Note: ramping is still necessary to deal with mechanical constraints, a common rule is to avoid changes larger than 10%
per minute on fan speed.<br></p>

<p>A third limitation comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Loop_tuning">PID gains tuning</a> which is a
tedious and time-consuming process. Even when controllers come with pre-defined and safe tunings for a particular class
of equipment, the HVAC engineer will have to reconfigure them to reach good performance, since each ventilation system
is unique. However, this tuning, performed once for all (HVAC configurations are only partially revised from time to
time), has about zero chance to cover all operating conditions. This results in typical PID problems like <em>overshooting</em>
,
<em>oscillations</em> or <em>hunting</em>. This can be observed in chart below, where the desired set point is still fixed at 90%</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/pid_fan_oscillations.png" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 3: supply fan speed controlled by a PID subject to large oscillations</i></center>


<p>Last but not least, PID controllers are often driven by a single input: in our case, most-open VAV damper position.
However, is this really the goal of a supply fan or did we just find a proxy to accommodate with controller
specifications? The actual real goal is to maintain good thermal and air quality comfort in occupied spaces, while
minimizing energy consumption.</p>

<p>While the proxy target of 90% can satisfy first part, it has no consideration for energy
savings. How does this translate? This is very usual to find one damper open at 90% while others are way below. This isn’t
just a PID problem (or more specifically, just with the PID controlling the fan), but it’s natural to have zones with
less air demand than others, and zones that are almost always in demand (also known as rogue zones). With a PID, one
can’t do anything about that. Figure 4 illustrates this problem, where a large difference occurs between damper
positions.</p>

<p><img src="https://airboxlab.github.io/assets/pid_vs_ai/pid_dampers_position.png" alt="sources"></p>
<center><i>fig. 4: supply fan control strategy leading to large differences between VAV boxes dampers position</i></center>


<h4 id="if-only-i-had-known-that-before">“If only I had known that before…”</h4>

<p>A PID is only reacting: for a given change in input, it will vary its output to keep as close as possible to its set
point. It has no way to anticipate changes or take proactive actions, since it has neither explicit nor inferred knowledge of
the controlled system. Moreover, its single input gives it a very partial view of the process at hand.</p>

<p>With such <em>observer model</em>, anticipation isn’t possible, while simple intuitions could be used to save bits of energy
here and there. A simple example: when HVAC scheduled end of operations is in sight, one could be tempted to slowly
reduce heating or cooling equipment use but not too much to reach end time between desired spaces set points. This is
something a PID can’t do.</p>

<p>If we generalise this example, <strong>the optimal system should learn building thermal dynamics and discover best control
strategies</strong>. There are many, and they depend on building use and characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="design-conditions-versus-reality">Design conditions versus reality</h3>

<p>As stated in <em>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</em>
report <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-22072.pdf">Energy Savings for Occupancy-Based Control (OBC) of Variable-Air-Volume (VAV) Systems</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each terminal box has a minimum air-flow rate that ensures the ventilation requirements of the occupants of the zone served are met. This minimum air-flow rate is maintained at a constant value based on the design occupancy of the zone, which often corresponds to the maximum occupancy, because measurements of actual occupancy are not currently used to adjust the flow rate. […] In practice, control system integrators and installers often set the cooling minimum air-flow rate for ventilation to between 30% and 50% of the maximum air-flow rate of the terminal box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process of <em>Testing, Adjusting and Balancing</em> (TAB) of a building HVAC system is meant to deliver sufficient amount
of air, and make sure there will be enough heating and cooling capacity. All the calculation and testing is performed
using building <em>design conditions</em>. In practice, it is undertaken when building is still unoccupied, during one or a
handful of days (so during a particular season, with specific weather conditions). It doesn’t cover the actual use of
the building, which will vary over the course of its life: daily changes - with spaces more or less occupied depending
on the hour of the day - and more profound and permanent changes, like when exceptional conditions arise (Covid-19 and 
its cascade of lockdowns), or simply because tenants’ activity changes.</p>

<p>Another source of HVAC system misconfiguration and excessive energy use is the small and repetitive adjustments made 
over time by people who are responsible for occupants comfort, or to deal with system instability (operational conditions not
tested during initial setup). While it seems natural they make everything they can to guarantee satisfactory living
conditions, this often results in more energy wasted due to narrowed operational behaviour (e.g. raising minimum set
points).</p>

<h3 id="non-linearity-in-controlled-systems">Non-linearity in controlled systems</h3>

<p>HVAC systems are (highly) non-linear: they will respond non-linearly depending on controlled equipment, command
magnitude, and current state of the system (for instance: cooling or heating mode).</p>

<p>A classic example can be …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The goal of the Jakarta EE 9.1 release is to deliver a set of specifications functionally equivalent to Jakarta EE 9 and adding the support for the Java SE 11 runtime.</p>

<p>The Platform team sees Jakarta EE 9.1 as an extension to the foundational Jakarta EE 9 release.
No API updates are expected in Jakarta EE 9.1.
Only the Platform and Web Profile Specifications along with the TCK and Compatible Implementations should be affected by Jakarta EE 9.1.</p>

<h2 id="java-se-11">Java SE 11</h2>
<h3 id="api-source-level">API Source Level</h3>

<p>The APIs will continue to be compiled at the Java SE 8 level.
The APIs need to be usable by both Java SE 8 and Java SE 11.
Thus, keeping the same Java SE 8 source/target level for the APIs will still be required.</p>

<h3 id="tck-source-level">TCK Source Level</h3>

<p>The TCKs will continue to be compiled at the Java SE 8 level.
This would allow the same TCK to be used for Compatibility testing with either Java SE 8 or 11 runtime.</p>

<h4 id="signature-tests">Signature Tests</h4>

<p>Currently, the TCK Signature Tests are specific to the level of the Java SE runtime which is being used for testing.
The TCK may need to be updated to include the Java SE 11 signatures.</p>

<h4 id="corba-and-rmiiiop-tests">CORBA and RMI/IIOP Tests</h4>

<p>For Jakarta EE 9, the CORBA tests were left as-is and these tests were executed by default, but the RMI/IIOP tests were removed as part of the default execution.
Since the CORBA ORB was removed from Java SE 11, there will be an impact to the TCK to support these CORBA tests.
To minimize the impact to Jakarta EE 9.1, the expectation is to leave the CORBA tests in the TCK, but make them optional.</p>

<h4 id="web-services-tests">Web Services Tests</h4>

<p>Many of the Web Services related features (XML Binding, XML Web Services, Web Services Metadata, and SOAP with Attachments) were dropped from Java SE 11.
But, they were picked up for optional inclusion with Jakarta EE 9.
Since these optional features were provided with the Java SE 8 runtime, the TCK may need to be adjusted when running with the Java SE 11 runtime where they are no longer provided.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-implementation-ci-source-level">Compatible Implementation (CI) Source Level</h3>

<p>How a Compatible Implementation supports the Java SE 11 runtime will be left as a vendor-defined solution.</p>

<h2 id="specification-project-minor-point-releases">Specification Project Minor (Point) Releases?</h2>

<p>A few of the Jakarta Specification projects are already working on their “next” releases.
This type of new, innovative work needs to be encouraged and promoted.</p>

<p>Since the ultimate goal of Jakarta EE 9.1 is to support the Java SE 11 runtime in a timely manner, no Specification API updates will be included in 9.1.
If the Specification text or Javadoc needs to be updated to clarify some processing without any functional impact to the API, those types of changes should be entertained via a Service Release (x.y.z).
The exact process for Specification Service Releases (extent of changes, reviews required, ballots required, etc) is still being worked out.</p>

<p>The preferred approach would be for these Specification projects to continue with their proposed “next” releases – taking them through the required plan and review processes.
But, don’t attempt to tie them to the Jakarta EE 9.1 release.
These would just be independent updates to the Jakarta Specifications that could be discussed for inclusion in a future Jakarta EE Platform release.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables-in-jakarta-ee-91">Deliverables in Jakarta EE 9.1</h2>

<p>The following details the specifications and APIs included within the Jakarta EE 9.1 Platform.</p>

<h3 id="jakarta-ee-91-specifications">Jakarta EE 9.1 Specifications</h3>

<p>List of existing specifications in Jakarta EE 9.1.
(<strong>Note:</strong> Service Releases (x.y.z) are not specified here since no functional changes are included in a Service Release.)</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="jakarta-ee-91-apis">Jakarta EE 9.1 APIs</h3>

<p>The Platform and Web Profile API jar files will be re-generated to correspond with the 9.1 release designation.
The intent is that the content of the 9.0 and 9.1 jar files are the same, but update the maven coordinate artifacts to make them easy to find and use.</p>

<h2 id="release-milestones">Release Milestones</h2>

<p>The Jakarta EE 9.1 platform project is proposing that this release plan covers all specifications targeted for Jakarta EE 9.1.
As stated in the scope, specifications will not be making functionality changes for inclusion in this release, therefore individual specification release plans are not necessary.</p>

<h3 id="full-platform-and-web-profile-release-candidate">Full Platform and Web Profile Release Candidate</h3>

<p>Although the Jakarta EE 9.1 release is limited in scope, at least one Release Candidate for Jakarta EE Platform and Web Profile will be produced.
These Release Candidates will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Release candidates for all API JARs in Maven Central</li>
  <li>Release candidate Bill of Material pom files for Web Profile and Full Platform in Maven Central</li>
  <li>Release candidate TCKs</li>
  <li>Release candidate compatible implementation(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the release candidate has been validated and any issues ironed out, the full 9.1 release will proceed with all deliverables required for submission to the specification committee for approval.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-progress-reviews">Proposed Progress Reviews</h3>

<p>Since this Jakarta EE 9.1 release is limited in scope, no interim progress reviews are expected.
The overall schedule for Jakarta EE 9.1 will be maintained on <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee9/JakartaEE9.1#jakarta-ee-9.1-schedule">this separate page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-implementation">Compatible Implementation</h3>

<p>The JESP requires us to have a Compatible Implementation of the Full Profile and Web Profile available before the Platform Project can deliver a final specification.
At this stage, it is assumed that this implementation will be Eclipse GlassFish.
However, the Platform project has no control over the release dates of Eclipse GlassFish.
The platform project will maintain close coordination with the Eclipse GlassFish project for the duration of the Jakarta EE 9.1 release development.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>You are probably going to be dealing with text files sometime during your development career. These could be plain text, csv, or json. They may have data you want to get out, or log files you want to examine. You may be transforming from one format to another.</p>
<p>Now, if this is a regular occurrence, you may want to build a script or a program around this problem (or use a third party service which aggregates everything together). But sometimes these files are one offs. Or you use them once in a blue moon. And it can take a little while to write a script, look at the libraries, and put it all together.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to learn some of the unix tools available on <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/04/learn-the-command-line/">the command line</a>. Here are three that I consider “table stakes”.</p>
<p><strong>awk</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi purpose line processing utility. I often want to grab lines of a log file and figure out what is going on. Here’s a few lines of a log file:</p>
<p><code>54.147.20.92 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-" "Slackbot 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"</code></p>
<p>If I want to see only the ip addresses (assuming these are all in a file called logs.txt), I’d run something like:</p>
<p><code>$ awk '{print $1}' logs.txt<br>
54.147.20.92<br>
185.24.234.106<br>
185.24.234.106</code></p>
<p>There’s lots more, but you can see that you’d be able to slice and dice delimited data pretty easily. Here’s a <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-awk1/">great article which dives in further</a>.</p>
<p><strong>sed</strong></p>
<p>This is another line utility. You can use it for all kinds of things, but I primarily use it to do search and replace on a file. Suppose you had the same log file, but you wanted to anonymize the the ip address and the user agent. Perhaps you’re going to ship them off for long term storage or something. You can easily remove this with a couple of sed commands.</p>
<p><code>$ sed 's/^[^ ]*//' logs.txt |sed 's/"[^"]*"$//'<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com"</code></p>
<p>Yes, it looks like line noise, but this is the power of regular expressions. They’re in every language (though with slight variations) and worth learning. sed gives you the power of regular expressions at the command line for processing files. I don’t have a great sed tutorial I’ve found, but googling shows a number.</p>
<p><strong>jq</strong></p>
<p>If you work on the command line with modern software at all, you have encountered json. It’s used for configuration files and data transmission. Sometimes you get an array of json and you just want to pick out certain attributes of it. Tools like sed and awk fail at this, because they are used to newlines separating records, not curly braces and commas. Sure, you could use regular expressions to parse simple json, and there are times when I’ve done this. But a far better tool is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. I’m not as savvy with this as with the others, but have used it whenever I’m dealing with an API that delivers json (which is most modern ones). I can pull the API down with <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> (another great tool) and parse it out with jq. I can put these all in a script and have the exploration be repeatable.</p>
<p>I did this a few months&nbsp; ago when I was doing some exploration of an elastic search system. I crafted the queries with curl and then used jq to parse out the results so that I could make some sense of this. Yes, I could have done this with a real programming language, but it would have taken longer. I could also have used a gui tool like postman, but then it would not have been replicable.</p>
<p>sed and awk should be on every system you run across; jq is non standard, but easy to install. It’s worth spending some time getting to know these tools. So next time you are processing a text file and need to extract just a bit of it, reach for sed and awk. Next time you get a hairy json file and you are peering at it, look at jq. I think you’ll be happy with the result.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Currently, the collision of artists and cryptocurrencies is playing out across Twitter and other platforms, dividing artists who normally praise and support each other into two camps. One camp wants to make money selling their art as NFTs, and the other camp hates the idea.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun to see cryptoart/NFTs bring a class war to the digital art community. I love see artists that have followed each other for years block each other.

</div></figure>
<p>If you haven’t heard already, NFTs are enjoying increasing popularity alongside the current record-high cryptocurrency values. NFT stands for <strong>Non-Fungible Token</strong> – an atomic digital token that can be traded for cryptocurrency. Many artists are now selling “digital editions” of their artwork as NFTs on special-purpose marketplaces – the buyer can call themselves the owner of a piece of digital art, similar to how one might purchase a limited edition print. Some of these art NFTs have been trading for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars, despite granting the buyer no physical copy, no reproduction rights, or anything other than the ability to say, “Yes, I own this token,” and to sell it to someone else.</p>
<p>What’s been particularly divisive is the objection to the shockingly high energy usage of the most popular cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053">One estimate</a> puts the energy consumption involved in a single NFT sale at around 340 kWh, equivalent to driving 1,000km in an ICE car. Most of this is due to the proof-of-work algorithm that’s core to Ethereum[1], the blockchain that most of these NFT sales take place on. Essentially, many objectors see making and selling NFTs as something akin to clearcutting rainforests in order to grow crops.</p>
<p>The artists putting their work up as NFTs see this as an opportunity to live the artist’s dream – to produce highly sought-after pieces for which collectors will pay large sums of money. It’s simultaneously an elevation of their value and status, and also their ticket to a life free from the struggle of paying the bills. Is it so easy to pass on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance at wealth, even when people are telling you that it’s contributing to environmental harm?</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to make tens of thousands of dollars off one piece of art. I want to be wealthy and comfortable off of my artwork.

</div></figure>
<p>The YES NFT camp has a few arguments, including that NFT transactions are not 1:1 correlated with increased energy use[2], and aren’t you eating meat anyways?</p>
<p>The NO NFT camp seems to have been already stressed out by anti-maskers, racial injustice, income inequality, and all the other ills of the world, only to find out that their beloved colleagues are willing to sell out the environment for a chance to make a quick buck. Depending on who you ask, the whole thing smacks of tech-bro[3] greed, a pyramid scheme, or abandoning your morals.</p>
<p>This has caused some heated threads on Twitter around these talking points, and since it doesn’t seem totally fair to air all the drama – Twitter is very public though! – I’ll put my predictions here instead:</p>
<div><div>
<p>The NFT gold rush won’t last forever. Yes, some artists and speculators have made a good chunk of change selling NFTs. But the idea of artists simultaneously having trouble getting $1,000 commission work while selling old JPEGs for tens of thousands of dollars doesn’t add up. The money that’s buying NFTs is either speculators hoping to resell it for more, or people who previously accumulated cryptocurrency and are either reluctant to cash out or are under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>. They wouldn’t spend $1,000 on a digital picture, but would happily spend 0.7 ETH ($1,137).</p>
<p>As more NFTs are minted and put up for sale (supply increases) and the cryptocurrency wealth sloshing around settles or hype dies down (demand decreases), I think NFT prices and volume will settle down to lower levels. No artist to my knowledge has become wealthy by selling NFTs yet, but in the future the chances of even paying your bills via NFTs will be very low.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Despite my negative outlook on NFTs, I think they’ll be around in the long run with limited use[4] along the lines of Patreon – if people are willing to pay monthly to support an artist, why not also be the Digital Owner of one of that artist’s works? It’s a way to publicly show your support for your favorite artists.</p>
<p>[1] Ethereum is not scheduled to move to proof-of-stake until some time in 2022. The NFT gold rush may run out of steam by then.</p>
<p>[2] The USD price of a cryptocurrency has a bigger correlation to its mining electricity consumption. The higher the price, the more profitable it is to keep your computer on all night mining cryptocurrency, thus the best way to fight the environmental cost is to crash the USD exchange rate. There’s even a plausible scenario where artists selling their earned ETH to pay their bills puts downward pressure on the USD-ETH rate, reducing ETH’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>[3] The artists selling NFTs seem to be mostly men, like cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are also mostly men. This is based on my limited non-scientific browsing of NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>[4] One legitimately interesting use case for NFTs could center around tracking ownership of Original Characters (OCs), for which there already is a thriving market for trading and selling. Basically, the artist draws a cool/fierce/cute/sexy paladin/drow/khajiit/whatever character, and the buyer gets exclusive rights to own that character, use it for role playing, take the included “refsheet” to other artists to commission custom art of said character, or resell the character. It’s all very ad-hoc and exists largely outside the world of copyright law as we know it. The demographic also seems to be teenagers, which might hamper adoption of NFTs.</p>

<p><span>This page will be an ever-evolving log of my backyard shedquarters. The last update was February 28th.</span></p>
<p>During 2020 I began working full-time from home in our 2 bedroom house. I completely took over the kitchen table
for a while because I thought the pandemic would only last a few weeks, which was adorable in hindsight. After a
couple of months I moved to the spare bedroom and set up shop in there. Our company has since decided to go
fully remote forever, so I needed a more dedicated space for working</p>
<p>I've always wanted a shedquarters because it seems so fun to build out the perfect workspace, so I decided to
pull the trigger on it sometime in October.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on Twitter, here's the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About a month ago, I got a 10x20 shed
        delivered so I could build out a shedquarters office in my backyard. It's been a ton of fun (and
        work) so far! I'm going to share a lot of it on this thread over the next couple of months until it's
        done. (Also at <a href="https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk">https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk</a>.)

        1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h2>Build vs Buy</h2>
<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I was going to try to build a shed from the ground up, or buy a
pre-made one. Having never built anything before I thought it might be fun to try something relatively
low-stakes like a shed. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and felt pretty confident I could pull <em>something</em>
off.</p>
<p>However, in the end I decided that it would take <em>way</em> longer than I wanted to build it from the ground up, and
I have a lot of other projects that would suffer if I spent 3 months building a shed. I am so, so glad I decided
to buy a pre-made shell instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Builder</h2>
<p>There are lots of fancy options that come totally pre-done and look beautiful (<a href="http://kangaroomsystems.com/">Kanga
Rooms</a> being one of them). Those were way too expensive for my budget, and didn't
leave me quite enough room for customizing to my liking.</p>
<p>Those fancier options are really geared toward "turn-key home offices", while what I wanted was more of "a shed
I can turn into an office".</p>
<p>There are a shed load (get it) of shed manufacturers to choose from, at least here in Texas! The one I settled
on was <a href="https://www.lonestarstructures.com/">Lone Star Structures</a>. Their prices are great, their customer
service is amazing, and they have an online shed designer that lets you build out exactly what you're looking
for. They also delivered and leveled it for me, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my 3D design:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/render.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/render.jpg"></a></p>

<h2>Building Size</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a 10x20 building, for two reasons. The first is that we only have about 10 feet of space in
the spot where the shed was going to go, so that limited the width. The second reason is that anything &lt;= 200
square feet does not require a permit.</p>
<p>We had an old shed that was 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, you can see how tight the width is:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The only access to our backyard is through a large gate that is just over 11ft wide.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>I have some pictures and videos of the delivery, you'll see just how tight it was even with the 10ft model.</p>
<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>We don't have a garage, so that old shed was serving the purpose of storing "garage stuff", which the new
building would have to do as well. To accomodate both the needs of a new office and "garage stuff", I decided to
split the shed into two sections. A 10x16 space for the office, and a 10x4 space for the garage stuff.</p>
<p>Lone Star Structures has the option to add a 4 foot "loft" in their configuration tool, so I added the loft and
then specifically requested that they build out a wall underneath.</p>
<p>Here's a floor plan overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like in real life:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The large, double doors open from the yard into the storage area. You can see the stud wall Lone Star built for
me to partition the space. Eventually there will be a proper wall there and the two spaces will be totally
discrete.</p>
<p>Here's a shot from the inside looking out. You can see the "loft" that will be accessible from the office and
give me a bit more air conditioned storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The astute reader will now note that when the wall is completed... there will be no way to get into the office!
More on that soon.</p>
<h2>Demolition of the Old Shed</h2>
<p>Before the new shed came, I had to get rid of the old one. I tried for a week or two to <em>give it away</em> on
Craigslist, but that failed hysterically. A couple of people asked if it would fit in their SUV. It's a 10x12
shed that weighs hundreds of pounds!</p>
<p>After being disappointed by Craigslist once again, I decided to borrow a sawzall and demolish it myself. It was
a lot of hard work, but this timelapse makes it look super easy:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxhCjshVRvU?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Preparing the Pad for the New Shed</h2>
<p>Since the new shed is 8 feet longer than the old shed was, I needed to make the pad 8 feet longer. Lone Star was
responsible for leveling the shed (which they did a great job of), I just had to provide a pad that was within
12 inches (!) of level.</p>
<p>The old pad was a few inches lower than the surrounding ground, so I wanted it to be a little more uniform.</p>
<p>I started by tilling the ground and then used the broad side of a pick axe to break it up more. I repeated that
process for... ever. Tilling, axing, raking, over and over.</p>
<p>After I got it all level enough, I wanted to compact it down. Since I didn't have a tamper and didn't want to
spend 40 bucks on one I'll never use again, my genius neighbor and I made a pretty janky makeshift tamper out of
a sledgehammer and some boards. It mostly kind of worked!</p>
<p>It also looks hysterical and insane.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>Turns out the best tamper is not a sledgehammer attached to some boards, but rather an SUV. Maybe my best idea
so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Again, the timelapse make it look super easy, but it was a lot of work. Please validate me!</p>

<h2>Delivery Day</h2>
<p>The day the shed was delivered I was nervously just waiting around for them to show up. We live on a quiet
residential street that is not super wide, so I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down the
street. I was also worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down our driveway, which is also not very wide.</p>
<p>Then a full on 18-wheeler turned the corner and I thought to myself</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/mistake.gif"></p><p>Not only did he have my shed on there, he had another one too! Like it was no big deal!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-bHsgYG2KM?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the face of a concerned person whose neighbors are coming outside to see what the ruckus is.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here I am talking to him trying to figure out just exactly what the plan is here, as if I could help.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the guy that does this for a living (not me) was less concerned than the average software
developer (me), and apparently it <em>was</em> no big deal because he just tipped the magic trailer back and plopped it
in the street like a boss.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The guy (Joe) that drove the shed down the driveway and positioned in place was a wizard with his tiny little
forklift. I have no idea how he did it, because we had only inches to spare.</p>
<p>I'm so pumped for my new shed that I pre-emptively celebrate with a Diet Coke while Joe is toiling away
somewhere actually getting stuff done.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I did have to cut trees back in a few places on both sides of the driveway, so I wasn't <em>totally</em> useless.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here's the whole 1-2 hour process nice and sped up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfLARMYZ_o?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once it was in place, Joe spent another 30 or 45 minutes getting it all level.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And now I have a shed! Monster is concerned that it may be too much house for him to handle, I haven't broken
the news that it's not actually for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Adding a French Door</h2>
<p>Because I'm going to be having two separate partitions in the building with a wall in between, I'll need a way
to access the office. The doors that are already present on the shed access the tool/yard storage area.</p>
<p>When I was designing the shed I had the option to add a door and some windows using their online design tool,
but everything they offer is geared towards sheds because... they build sheds. I wanted something that looked
a little nicer since this is going to be my office and take up a large portion of our yard.</p>
<p>One of my friends recommended that I put in french doors that can serve both as an access point and let in a ton
of light. I found a good <a href="http://www.craddocklumber.com/">local lumber company</a> that I bought the door from. I
was able to customize it so that it swings <em>out</em> instead of in, because there isn't a ton of room for an
in-swinging door in the office.</p>
<p>They also delivered it for me. Turns out it's very very heavy. And beautiful!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg"></a></p>
<p>For this part of the project I recruited my Dad and my brother-in-law because I knew it was going to be a tough
one to do solo.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We started by clearing the studs out of the section that the door was going to fit in. The placement was figured
so that I have enough room to put my desk in one corner without it overlapping into the door. We used a combo of
sledgehammer + prybar to get the studs out.</p>
<p>Note that this shed is so small (and has the loft wall), that there is
basically no load carried by this wall, so we could just knock the studs out without worrying. We did of course
frame the door in, but there's just so little to worry about in this regard because of the size of the building.</p>
<p>If you do something like this, don't listen to some guy on the internet, ask someone who actually knows what
they're doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Once we got it framed up, we took a sawzall and just started cutting it out! There's no going back from this
point, which was very scary.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg"></a></p>
<p>With the wall gone, it was time to dry fit the door and start getting it installed. This was the first time any
of us had ever installed a french door, so I was pleased that we got it pretty close! I think the rough
opening was bigger than it needed to be, but we added an extra 2x4 and lots of shims and that seemed to make it
fit well enough. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<p>Before we did this part I watched a lot of videos on YouTube, and my neighbor (who is <a href="https://www.micekmade.com/">a …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  



  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There are several reasons to consider deleting Facebook. A couple good ones are user privacy and psychological impact. First, as a company it has been fairly hostile to user privacy concerns, even when controlling for the fact that as a major platform it attracts more scrutiny than the vast majority of other software companies. Second, as a platform it works a bit like a slot machine, in that it promotes addictive behaviours and keeps you from engaging in deep work.</p>

<p>A few things might keep you from wanting to fully leave, however if you’re reading this in all likelihood you don’t use Facebook to the same extent you once did, considering that their key market is now the less tech-native segment of the baby-boomer generation. Many people have found that they don’t feel like they’re missing out on anything of value after leaving the platform, and I include myself among those that have enjoyed adopting a more minimalist approach to their digital lives.</p>

<p>A relevant concept here is Dunbar’s number - a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships - named after British anthropologist Robin Dunbar. That number is 150, however it’s worth bearing in mind that is the upper limit. In reality, most of us never come close to maintaining 150 close relationships at any one time.</p>

<p>Should you want to go ahead with deleting your account, there are a few things worth considering. One of Facebook’s main uses is as a reminder for your friends’ birthdays, so we want to make sure we export its calendar. Another thing we might want to do is a bit of privacy-focused prevention: delete our posts, leave all groups, download and delete our photos, and unlike all of our liked pages. This is in case Facebook’s ghost profiles turn out to be a real practice, and the evidence seems to suggest they are. Ghost profiles are accounts that Facebook creates, with information it contains on people that aren’t signed up to the platform. Finally, we might want to let our contacts know that we’re leaving the platform and ask them to not upload any photos or information about us, should privacy be a concern.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download all photos</li>
  <li>Download Facebook’s calendar</li>
  <li>Unfriend, unlike, and delete all photos</li>
  <li>Announce departure</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-download-all-photos">1: Download all photos</h2>

<p>It’s fairly easy to export all of the photos you uploaded by simply using using Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information">download your information tool</a>. It’s less easy to download photos you’ve been tagged in. For this you’ll have to use some external tools, and most likely have to make use of a little programming.</p>

<p>The first and most simple option is using one of these IFTT recipes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/126727p-back-up-photos-you-re-tagged-in-on-facebook-to-an-ios-photos-album">FB to iOS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/47704776d-save-photos-you-re-tagged-in-on-facebook-to-a-dropbox-folder">FB to Dropbox</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If for whatever reason you want to use another alternative you can follow <a href="https://matthew-johnston.com/DownloadAllFacebookTaggedPhotos/">this tutorial</a>. Essentially go to your photos page at <a href="https://facebook.com/me/photos">facebook.com/me/photos</a> and  run this JS script in your browser console to get the “FBIDs” of your photos:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>link</span> <span>of</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span><span>'</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span> 
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>link</span><span>.</span><span>href</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>?fbid=</span><span>"</span><span>))</span> <span>continue</span><span>;</span> 
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>link</span><span>.</span><span>href</span><span>).</span><span>searchParams</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>fbid</span><span>"</span><span>));</span> 
    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then feed that list to <a href="https://github.com/mgjohnston/fmpd/tree/patch-1">this python script</a> which downloads your photos.</p>

<p>I would recommend then hosting your photos on another cloud-hosting provider such as Apple Photos.</p>

<h2 id="2-download-facebooks-calendar">2: Download Facebook’s calendar</h2>
<p>You can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/birthday-calendar-extract/imielmggcccenhgncmpjlehemlinhjjo">this Chrome extension</a> for that, it’s quite straightforward.</p>

<h2 id="3-unfriend-unlike-and-delete-all-photos">3: Unfriend, unlike, and delete all photos</h2>
<p>There are quite a few command line interfaces that can help you with this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/spieglt/fb-delete">https://github.com/spieglt/fb-delete</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB]">https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another strategy is to scramble the information before you delete your account, however this requires a fair bit more time and programming some custom scripts.</p>

<h2 id="4-announce-departure">4: Announce departure</h2>
<p>As a final step I suggest announcing to your network that you’re leaving the platform, leaving alternative contact details and requesting that others don’t upload photos of you.
The process should take a few days to complete on Facebook’s end, at which point your data is <em>supposedly</em> deleted from their servers.</p>

<p>Now enjoy being away from the platform - try to select for high value activities to do in your free time, and notice how you’ll focus more on your most meaningful and rewarding relationships.</p>

                                <p>Many people see fountain pens as occasional writing instruments, maybe for doing some journaling or writing a letter, but that doesn’t have to be the case. The right fountain pen can be a great everyday tool, even if it never approaches the tool-like functionality of a ballpoint pen.</p>

<h2><span id="What_To_Look_For_In_An_Everyday_Fountain_Pen">What To Look For In An Everyday Fountain Pen</span></h2>
<p>An everyday pen is going to vary widely based on what your everyday looks like. For many of us this means sitting at a desk and looking at a computer screen, which means that our pen needs to be comfortable, functional (without being utilitarian), and ready to go at all times.</p>
<p>For others, an everyday fountain pen might require some sort of for transportation friendliness and perhaps some degree of toughness, which veers off from the “everyday fountain pen” to the “everyday carry fountain pen.” While a perfectly valid use case, we’ll differentiate between pens that need to go with you and pens that are simply going to see a lot of use each and every day.</p>

<p>The attributes you’ll want sort through for this “workhorse” pen are…</p>
<ol><li>Reliability</li>
<li>Ease of Use (cap type, etc.)</li>
<li>Ease of Maintenance</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ol><p>I put these in order based on the impact each will have on your use of the pen and how long it lasts as your everyday writer.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong> is key because the pen has to be ready to go when you want to use it. If you are on a Zoom and you need to write something down, your pen has to be at-the-ready. If your fountain pen can’t accomplish this, you simply won’t use it all the time and will revert to the ballpoint next to it on your desk.</p>
<p>Next comes <strong>ease of use</strong>, which means the pen has to be simple and trouble-free for you and your work style. This may mean that you opt for a pen that uses cartridges and has a snap-on cap instead of a screw-on one, because both of these things make pens easier to operate. This isn’t about what’s coolest or most desirable, but rather <em>removing the factors that hinder you from using a fountain pen</em>.</p>
<p>Much of the ease of use will come from the sensitivity of the nib and the choice of a filling system. First of all, it’s critical that you find your pen’s nib to be comfortable but not overall sensitive. If every time you want to dash off a thought you are worried about about holding the pen at exactly the right angle and the nib in its perfect “sweet spot” your work will be hindered.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of maintenance</strong> might be seen as an extension of ease of use, but for people who use their fountain pen as a primary writing tool, it’s worth distinguishing between the two. A pen that is easy to maintain will have old ink cleaned out quickly, featuring a feed that lets go of ink freely. The pen will be free of sensitive parts and most parts will be easy to cheap to replace, as well as user serviceable.</p>
<p>Any talk of <strong>price</strong> must be done relative to one’s own price sensitivity as well as your budget. If you are a professional scribe (not exactly a popular choice these days) or a calligrapher, an everyday pen might be one of your most expensive purchases. For most of us, an everyday pen shouldn’t be too expensive, because it’s something we want to use, not to baby, and you won’t mind then it takes a few inevitable bumps.</p>
<p>A good price range for an everyday pen would be $20 to $180, but this is only a loose guideline. Some people are less price sensitive and will be more inclined to use the pen — that is to say, to work — with a more expensive one, but be careful with this logic as the need to use a new purchase to justify its cost will wear aware quickly.</p>
<h3><span id="A_Note_On_Affordable_Pens">A Note On Affordable Pens</span></h3>
<p>While many excellent pens are sold under the $20 price point, they don’t have the same level of fit and polish of more expensive pens. The will also not last as long as pens that are a step up in price, so you’ll find small problems accruing, like loose caps and bent clips. This is why this list doesn’t have otherwise solid pens like the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/platinum-prefounte/">Platinum Prefounte</a>&nbsp;— they just won’t go the distance of these workhorse pens.</p>
<h2><span id="Top_Choices_For_Everyday_Fountain_Pens">Top Choices For Everyday Fountain Pens</span></h2>
<p>Here are some pens that make for excellent everyday usage over extended period of time.</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/lamy-safari-fountain-pen/">Lamy Safari</a></strong>: Affordable and highly usable, this will be the pen that comes to mind for many people. When combined with Lamy’s excellent cartridges its one of the most practical fountain pens sold today. The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/lamy-vista-fountain-pen/">Vista</a> is just as good.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/twsbi-eco-fountain-pen/"><strong>Twsbi Eco</strong></a>: This is a $30 pen that writes and has the features of a pen that’s easily twice the price. It’s highly rebuildable and pleasant both use and to maintain.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/penbbs-456-fountain-pen/"><strong>Penbbs 456</strong></a>: A large, good-looking pen with a vacuum-filling mechanism that means it carries a lot of ink. The nib is surprisingly good and while it looks underwhelming is writes smoothly and reliably.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/platinum-procyon/"><strong>Platinum Procyon</strong></a>: This is a pen that doesn’t get as much attention as it should. It has a stout metal body, a responsive steel nib, and a handsome design. It also has all the smart design decisions found in Platinum’s modern fountain pens, like a nib that basically never seems to try out and use of Platinum’s very good cartridges.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZlLIip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lamy Studio</strong></a>: Lamy’s best mid-range fountain pen. It has more weigh than the Safari but is a good deal more affordable than the 2000. It’s a really solid choice in a sub-$100 metal fountain pen.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/platinum-3776-century-fountain-pen/"><strong>Platinum 3776 Century</strong></a>: Unsharpen’s favorite fountain pen under $200, this pen writes like a dream and has a simple, reliable cartridge/converter system. The cap works great and it seals so well that the pen is always ready to write.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-custom-74-fountain-pen/">Pilot Custom 74</a></strong>: If you want a super smooth writer that has a lot of polish as well as a classic fountain pen look than the Custom 74 is a popular pick.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/lamy-2000-fountain-pen/"><strong>Lamy 2000</strong></a>: This is another excellent gold nib fountain pen that is designed to last for year of writing. It’s not quite as easy to service as the rest of the pens on the list, but it is rebuildable. You get a fantastic nib and a body that shows natural wear after use, so you can really feel this pen changing over time and becoming yours.</li>
</ul><h2><span id="Pens_That_Didnt_Make_It">Pens That Didn’t Make It</span></h2>
<p>Here are some pens you might have thought would be on the list, but aren’t along with the reason they didn’t make it.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-metropolitan/"><strong>Pilot Metropolitan</strong></a>: A good pen, but lacking in the polish of the pens on the list. Also the nib is less enjoyable and too utilitarian to be a pen that you look forward to using for years on end.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-vanishing-point/">Pilot Vanishing Point</a></strong>: Despite being a very popular pen, we’ve found the nib to be too finicky for everyday use and the likelihood of ink spitting. The pen is a bit complex on the inside too means it requires more care than any of the pens on the list.</li>
<li><a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/kaweco-classic-sport-fountain-pen/"><strong>Kaweco Sport</strong></a>: A fine mini-pen but it’s a bit small and the undersized nib isn’t quite at the quality level of the others on this list. This pen is quite close to making it though.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives. There are parallels between the two projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers might notice …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div>
      <p>I recently proposed a new research project idea: let’s take all of GitHub (or &lt;insert your preferred VCS host&gt;) and create a multi-language (even partially language-agnostic) concrete syntax tree of all the code so that we can do some otherwise impossibly difficult further research and answer incredibly complex questions.</p>

<p>This project is named <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">World Syntax Tree</a>, or WST in short.</p>

<p>Originally I started the project using MongoDB and storing references between nodes as <code>ObjectID</code>s, but I quickly realized that a tabular format was not performant enough to be able to effectively represent a true tree.</p>

<p>So instead I switched over the whole project to the first and foremost graph database I came across: Neo4j.</p>

<p>As I quickly learned the new database paradigm I also quickly learned that there are a lot of problems between me and inserting literally hundreds of terabytes of data into a single graph…</p>



<p>The very first designs used <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neomodel">neomodel</a> to control the layout and define the graph connections, and in fact <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py">we still use neomodel</a> for the less performance-sensitive parts of the collection process.</p>

<p>After running with neomodel for a fairly long time it was obvious it was far too much overhead when I inspected the collector process with <code>cProfile</code> and <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/">snakeviz</a>.</p>

<p>Using neomodel there were more than twice as many required queries for simply inserting one syntax node (<code>WSTNode</code>), extra checks like Cardinality and multiple statements just to set properties on newly created nodes were quite slow: at best I found I could insert a few hundred nodes per second using 128 processes.</p>



<p>From just the first few google results it was clear that writing my own raw cypher queries was the next move in order to better control exactly what operations needed to happen.</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n1.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n1.png" alt="Profiler view: Majority of runtime stuck inside neomodel's checks"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Profiler view: Majority of runtime stuck inside neomodel's checks</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The next PR that came from these efforts reworked the WSTNode creation routine into a series of functions that each did a distinct task: <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/c8d3f9f2c04f231dd93b4504b72a3f4da097edcf/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L91">create the node, connect the node, add the node text, connect the node text,</a> etc.</p>

<p>This did improve compared to using neomodel, but now the major bottleneck was really waiting on the network socket.</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n2.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n2.png" alt="Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each of those 5 blocks corresponds to one of the 5 functions used during insertion of a WSTNode, noticing how they were all approximately the same size led me onto my next improvement…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once I saw how long each query took to initialize a connection and read back the results I figured I should reduce the total number of queries, which was quite easy really.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a node, returning the ID, running a new query to connect using that ID… just rewriting the create query to connect the new node as well meant an entire query less to execute!</p>

<p>So now that we <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/ea9dcc968e83534318a049268ca5c674b7ae6d1c/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L107">reduced the number of calls made per node by more than half</a> we saw a reasonable improvement, but we’re still only talking about a few hundred nodes per second even with more than a 100 workers.</p>



<p>Now we’re at the difficult part of the problem. Because we’re inserting a collection of nodes that refer to each other, we can’t iterate them all in parallel, otherwise some nodes might not have their parent node written to the database yet.</p>

<p>So in order to do this I needed to add another property to the WSTNode structure: <code>preorder</code>. This property was unique for nodes within a file and is calculated before we insert the WSTNode into the database, meaning we can use this property to refer to nodes before they are given a node ID by neo4j.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to refer to nodes uniquely within the file we can batch together large numbers of node insertions by using the super-magical <code>UNWIND</code> cypher statement. Essentially this allows us to pass a huge query parameter (like 10,000 node’s worth of properties in a list) and <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L71-L86">execute a single query to create those 10,000 nodes</a>.</p>



<p>If any experienced Neo4j user has followed along so far, they might have already realized that the <code>preorder</code> property on my WSTNodes is not unique within the graph, so even though <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py#L65">we do have an index on that property</a>, when your graph grows to terabytes in size, you will have far too many nodes with the same <code>preorder</code> to efficiently search them all to find the one that has a relationship to the same <code>WSTFile</code> node we’re working in.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L75">this single extra condition inside the WHERE clause</a> the Neo4j database regularly would pin all 128 hardware threads of our lab server just searching through <code>WSTNode</code>s with the same <code>preorder</code> just to find the one that has a relationship to our <code>WSTFile</code>.</p>

<p>So instead I needed a way to refer to the nodes I just created with a constant-time lookup. I spent a whole day just thinking about how to overcome this problem, and finally ended up just accepting the fact that it would be faster to just execute two queries rather than continue banging my head against cypher syntax quirks.</p>

<p>After the first query I use the returned created node IDs to do the constant-time relationship creation in the second query. There might be some way to create relationships based on results from an <code>UNWIND</code>, but as long as we’ve got constant-time inserts on the db side I am happy.</p>

<p>And it was indeed faster:</p>

<p>How’s that for performance improvement? We went from 330 seconds to under 3! Of course, 330 seconds for a single file was kind of absurd in the first place.</p>

<p>Now that my program was blazing fast, Neo4j has trouble keeping up:</p>



<p>These are problems I encountered outside the scope of my own program.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-transactions-in-memory">Too many transactions in memory</h2>

  <figcaption>Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My initial guess for large batch sizes was around 10,000 nodes per query, however when we multiply that by 128 (processes running in parallel) and a conservative estimate for RAM usage, we’re looking at trying to processes transactions in memory at multiple gigabytes per second.</p>

<p>The solution to this was to manually set the memory settings in <code>neo4j.conf</code>, since I have a fairly large system dedicated to research work I could steal quite a bit of memory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Settings from memrec had to be changed a bit vs what was recommended:
# I need at least 128G left over for my own code to run on the same system
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>initial_size</span>=<span>31</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>max_size</span>=<span>128</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>pagecache</span>.<span>size</span>=<span>259500</span><span>m</span>

<span># It is also recommended turning out-of-memory errors into full crashes,
# instead of allowing a partially crashed database to continue running:
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>jvm</span>.<span>additional</span>=-<span>XX</span>:+<span>ExitOnOutOfMemoryError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="database-not-up-to-the-requested-version">Database not up to the requested version</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>neo4j.exceptions.TransientError: {code: Neo.TransientError.Transaction.BookmarkTimeout} {message: Database 'top1k' not up to the requested version: 113071. Latest database version is 113054}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a tricky one, I still haven’t fully pinned down the exact conditions for this to happen, but it boils down to the database not applying the transactions in a timely manner, meaning the current “live version” could be more than a few transactions out of date. (With my scale of data it ranged from 5-20 versions out of date.)</p>

<p>The best solution I could come up for this problem was to only run half as many worker processes, my guess is that the database was having trouble handling 128 consecutive transactions at a time.</p>

<p>I’d like to know why exactly this happens, and if possible I would much rather prefer the query to stall until the requested version is met (or error the original query if that version can’t be reached) rather than fail a query later on.</p>

<p>If you happen to know something about why or how this happens, please leave a comment, email me, or even <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">open an issue on our project</a>!</p>

<h3 id="a-persistent-problem">A persistent problem</h3>

<p>I thought if I reduced the load on the database significantly it would have no problem keeping up, so I brought the batch size down to just 100 and ran only 8 processes, and yet we still arrive at the same problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database ‘top1k’ not up to the requested version: 2282021. Latest database version is 2282020</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is my database stuck in 2020 you ask? Not a clue, so this is really where the adventure begins.</p>

<p>Over the few days since initial release of this post, I have been trying nothing but to get to the bottom of why this is occuring, I have carefully picked through both the neo4j <code>debug.log</code> and <code>query.log</code> and nothing really stood out as a problem.</p>

<p>One thing notable about these errors is they always seem to happen after passing around ~250GB of data stored. The most I could store before being stopped by this error was ~319GB (uncompressed) in the neo4j data directory. There are only ~500 million nodes and ~1.7 billion relationships at this point, meaning the average inserted node was well under a kilobyte, all within reason.</p>

<p>I can definitively confirm that there’s no problem with the hardware, the data directory is stored on a RAIDZ (zfs) array of all SSD storage, and I’ve confirmed that I/O time is not the bottleneck, and there are over 50 unused CPU cores to spare.</p>

<p>So my thoughts now are that the insert time for these nodes might not actually be constant as I thought, otherwise we’d see the same behavior between millions of nodes and just a few thousand. Perhaps there’s nonlinear work being done in some of the indexes? Maybe the data is too large to be indexed fully? There are a number of reasons to test, so finding the real cause will take quite a bit of time.</p>

			<p>I like to make things as difficult for myself as possible, so first, I decided to become an independent-minded female immigrant in a parochial and patriarchal nation; then, when that got boring, I decided to become a woman in tech, where I found myself giving conference talks to rooms of professionals who could, technically and biologically, be my grown adult children.</p>

<p><span>T</span>hen, when that got boring, I pivoted out of code tech to policy tech, where I now find myself in much more forgiving company. Which is to say, for the first time since my non-tech career, I work alongside and in partnership with other Gen Xers.</p>
<p><em>Insert any number of Buzzfeed listicles here about what it’s like to be a GenXer in tech: we learned on floppies and dialup; we coded out of print magazines; we sowed our teenage wild oats on the parental tether of nothing more than a coin in a pay phone; we lived entire years of our student lives without a single photograph being taken of us; we navigated 9/11 on dumb cell phones which had antennas; we now live datafied existences, raising datafied children attending datafied virtual schools, in a world where everything we were raised to believe would sort us for life turned out to be boomer bullshit.</em></p>
<p>All of those formative experiences give us (cough) fortysomethings a perspective on the internet which the boomers who birthed us lack, and which the millenials who followed us will never know.</p>
<p>In fact, we’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of the trope of the internet being threatened by elderly politicians who don’t understand it, or us. And that trope, for the most part, is as true as it ever was.</p>
<p>I can count on one hand the number of boomer-aged Parliamentarians in my network who well and truly understand the internet and its culture. They’re good folks who have my time, anytime. The rest, sadly, have more in common with the editorial board of the now-unreadable Glasgow broadsheet which issues weekly diatribes against the internet and all those who sail in her: every word steeped in all the offended sense of entitlement that bitter old men can muster, every rant beating the same dead horse against an internet which took away the newspaper readership that should, in their opinions, be hanging on every word that comes out of their privileged white Scottish male mouths.</p>
<p>So goes it for lawmakers, who – by nature and by privilege – have been insulated from the social and economic changes which necessitated the shift from the web as a geek hobby to the web as democratised culture. The ones who legislate aginst the web as if trying to restore an old world which existed before it, a world which only ever benefited people who looked and sounded like them.</p>
<p>Those lawmakers were who I expected to spend most of my time dealing with after my full-time pivot to policy.</p>
<p>The reality has been a lot more mind-blowing to comprehend than that.</p>
<p>Brace yourself.</p>
<p>When I was in my early twenties, in the late 90s and early 00s, running work missions across downtown Washington DC – pop into the Capitol complex here, run a folder to the White House there, drop off something for the Secretary of State on a long lunch break – everyone I encountered looked like me. The same age, the same countenance, the same Scully red hair (hey, it worked on me). Government may have been directed by professional politicians, but its actual daily mechanics were run by kids just out of university who had all the energy in the world and nothing and no one holding them down.</p>
<p>That’s universal, and it hasn’t changed. Government and policy – the mechanics and grunt work, not the media showmanship – are powered by an army of hard-working, very young people who have all of the academic knowledge and very little of the practical experience. Those young folks, now, in 2021, who were in nappies when I was on the Hill, now run whatever corridors of power they (virtually) travel through, in professional support of those older politicians.</p>
<p>And it’s these young professionals – <em>not the boomer career politicians</em> – who are setting the tone of internet policy.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing.</p>
<p>We – the GenXers – think of the internet as the open web. The land of dialup telnet Unix systems, the days of table layout, the days of dot com, the days of early tech startups, the days of the internet as a connector, the days of the internet as a business opportunity, the days of the internet as a path to social justice and revolutions, the days of the internet as a light in the darkness. That’s all we have ever known.</p>
<p>Today’s policy facilitators – the millenials – think of the internet as MySpace and Facebook. The closed web. The land of always-on broadband and wifi, the days of content management systems, the days of tech bros, the days of the internet as a divider, the days of the internet as an acquisition for the giants, the days of the internet as a path to radicalisation and hatred, the days of the internet as petrol on a spark. That is all they have ever known.</p>
<p>And that is what they draft policy briefings, proposals, and legislation against.</p>
<p>Laws on freedom of speech. Laws on privacy. Laws on encryption. Laws on private surveillance. Laws on state surveillance.</p>
<p>The truths I held to be self-evident are things they have never known.</p>
<p>And, politically, they are in the driving seat. They are running the show.</p>
<p><em>Not me. Not the old folks. Them.</em></p>
<p>Just like I was, a long time ago, with my Scully hair, in my Unix dialup world, a world before the TV signal briefly went out because the antenna which controlled the TV signal was on top of the tower with the plane-shaped hole in it, the hole which turned one of my university classmates into a centimetre-long fragment of a finger recovered 18 months later.</p>
<p>Today’s young tech policy professionals are are, quite rightfully, responding to the only internet in the only world they have ever known. The awful one. The one where the internet <em>was and is</em> a handful of billion-pound companies. The one where the internet has only ever been petrol on a fire. The one where the internet has been essential infrastructure like water and heat, not a thing you had to request and master. The closed internet made for them. Not the open internet I got to make.</p>
<p>So if you think that the biggest threat to encryption is elderly politicians who still need their secretaries to print out emails for them, it’s time you found yourself in a meeting with someone under the age of 30 who is going to war against encryption because <em>he</em> has never needed encryption in his life.</p>
<p>If you think that the biggest threat to internet freedom is old white men who hate the internet because it does not allow them to attack anyone who does not look or sound like them, it’s time you found yourself in a meeting with someone under the age of 30 who is unabashedly in favour of mandatory identity verification for all users of the internet to protect people who look and sound like her.</p>
<p>And if you think that the biggest threat to freedom of speech on the open web is a tech billionaire in California, it’s time you found yourself in a meeting with someone under the age of 30 who sees a legislative victory against online freedom of speech, cloaked in the mantle of a victory against the tech billionaire, as a useful stepping stone to his political ambitions.</p>
<p>Those old Thatcherites still in politics, the elderly dames in the Lords, the newspaper editors with the offended senses of entitlement, they can whinge all they want about how the internet has changed the world they knew. And you can continue to waste your time on them, and their tropes, if it makes you feel better about yourself.</p>
<p>But political power, now, rests in the hands of young professionals who are – <em>rightfully – </em>legislating to change the only internet they have ever known.</p>
<p>The shitty corporate one.</p>
<p>The open web we let slip through our fingers.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, the best things standing in their way of their spite and their avarice and their political aspirations are the Gen X fortysomethings who saw something better about the open web, and comprehended what was on their screens in a way that nothing has ever touched them since, and still believe in what the open web can be, and understand where things went wrong, and have an idea of how to put things right, and know how to create and use and fork the tools to make it so, and know the north stars they navigate home by, and have never, ever forgotten them, and who need a little bit of reminding, in chaotic times, of what it was like to telnet into a blank screen which contained the entire world.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
I've been using Kubernetes for almost a year now and, to be honest, I like the experience so far. Most of my use cases were rather trivial and thanks to its declarative approach, Kubernetes makes deploying and scaling stateless services pretty simple. I usually just describe my application in a YAML file as a set of interconnected services, feed it to Kubernetes, and let the built-in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loops</a> bring the state of the cluster closer to the desired state by creating or destroying some resources for me automagically.</p>
<p>However, many times I've heard that <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/">the real power of Kubernetes comes with its extensibility</a>. Kubernetes designed for automation. It brings a lot of useful automation out of the box. But it also provides extension points that can be used to customize Kubernetes capabilities. The cleverness of the Kubernetes design is that it encourages you to keep the extensions feel native! So when I stumbled upon the first few Kubernetes Operators on my Ops way, I could not even recognize that I'm dealing with custom logic...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to take a closer look at the Operators pattern, see which Kubernetes parts are involved in operators implementation, and what makes operators feel like first-class Kubernetes citizens. Of course, with as many pictures as possible.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="a-namekubernetes-objects-and-controllersakubernetes-objects-and-controllers"><a name="kubernetes-objects-and-controllers"></a>Kubernetes Objects and Controllers</h2>
<p>Everything in Kubernetes seems to revolve around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">objects</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">controllers</a>.</p>
<p>Kubernetes objects such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, or Events are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Objects are also used as "records of intent." By creating (or removing) objects one can describe the <em>desired</em> state of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><i>Objects are like data structures.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, controllers are infinite loops that watch the <em>actual</em> and the <em>desired</em> states of your cluster. When these two states diverge, controllers start making changes aiming to bring the current state of the cluster closer to the desired one.</p>
<p><i>Controllers are like algorithms.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-control-loop-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes Control Loop">
</p>

<p>I'll get to the controllers part later in this article and now let's focus on the objects.</p>
<h2 id="a-namekubernetes-api-architectureakubernetes-api-architecture"><a name="kubernetes-api-architecture"></a>Kubernetes API Architecture</h2>
<p>All interactions with Kubernetes objects, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/">directly</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">indirectly</a>, happen through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/">Kubernetes API</a> - a highly structured masterpiece of software design.</p>
<p>There is a ton of documentation written on Kubernetes API and related topics and I spent quite some time digesting it. Since we are going to talk about the Kubernetes Operator pattern which heavily depends on the capabilities of the Kubernetes API, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the API design principles first. Following is my super-condensed excerpt from the docs.</p>
<p>Kubernetes offers a RESTful declarative HTTP API. Still remember those Kubernetes objects? <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources">A collection of objects of a certain kind form an <em>API resource</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always check the list of available API resources using <code>kubectl api-resources</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
namespaces    ns           v1           false        Namespace
nodes         no           v1           false        Node
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
jobs                       batch/v1     true         Job
...</code></pre>
<p>OK, great, we've got resources. But Kubernetes evolves quickly. What if a new attribute needs to be added to an existing resource definition? API versioning is always hard. <i>&lt;speculation mode&gt;</i>Apparently, Kubernetes API started with a common prefix <code>/api/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;resource&gt;</code> for all the API resources. However, a change in a single resource would require a whole API version bump. So, with the growth in the number of available resources, the need for some sort of grouping and subversioning emerged.<i>&lt;/speculation mode&gt;</i></p>
<p>API groups to the rescue! <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning">A bunch of related resources forms an API group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make it easier to evolve and to extend its API, Kubernetes implements API groups that can be enabled or disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also check the list of available API groups and their versions using <code>kubectl api-versions</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apps/v1
...</code></pre>
<p>Well, at this point, I should warn you - it seems that in the documentation, the term <em>resource</em> is often used in the meaning of an <em>object</em> (but not vice versa). So, context matters.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, objects of the same kind are distinguished by their names. So, if you start two Pods, both should get a unique name. But clusters can be pretty big and since names are supposed to be unique within a cluster, we need a mechanism to prevent collisions. Something like lots of logical clusters within one physical cluster. Allow me to introduce you to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces"><em>namespaces</em></a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, API objects are fully qualified by their API group, resource type, namespace (unless cluster-scoped), and name.</p>
<p>Have you become totally confused by this time? No, worries, I've got a <del>simple</del> diagram for you 🙈</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-structure-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API structure"></p><p><i>Kubernetes API structure.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So, a quick summary - we've learned about objects, resources, groups, and namespaces. But what's up with the promised customization?</p>
<h2 id="a-namekubernetes-custom-resourcesakubernetes-custom-resources"><a name="kubernetes-custom-resources"></a>Kubernetes Custom Resources</h2>
<p>It seems like there is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md">a great deal of effort</a> in keeping the Kubernetes API coherent but extensible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>coherent</em> here? Kubernetes API consists of endpoints called <em>resources</em>. These API resources adhere to a set of common requirements - they are nouns and manipulated in a declarative manner (RESTful CRUD), they should be updated relatively infrequently and be reasonably small in size, their names should be <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names">valid DNS subdomains</a>, etc.</p>
<p>These restrictions allow unifying the resource workflows. For instance, you can get, describe, or update a collection of Pods in pretty much the same way as a collection of Services, Nodes, or RBAC roles:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
$ kubectl get roles

$ kubectl describe pods  # or services, or roles

$ kubectl edit pods  # or services, or roles</code></pre>
<p>Not only <code>kubectl</code> benefits from this uniformity. Here is a full list of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features">common features</a> enabled by the unified design:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-common-features-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API common features"></p>
</div>

<p>It's pretty handy, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, if I were to extend the API, it'd be reasonable for me to expect that my endpoints would benefit from this common functionality as well. But that would mean that the API extension should be done by adding more resources!</p>
<p>And indeed, in Kubernetes, one can easily register <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources"><em>custom resources</em></a>. The procedure is fully dynamic and doesn't require restarting or updating the API server.</p>
<p>How such a custom resource can be added? Well, again, it's Kubernetes! Of course, by interacting with another, already existing resource! There is a special API resource called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition">from another documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-namehow-to-create-custom-resourceahow-to-create-custom-resource"><a name="how-to-create-custom-resource"></a>How to Create Custom Resource</h2>
<p>Let's try to create a custom resource. Remember, a resource specifies a certain kind of Kubernetes object. Canonically, objects possess some attributes. So, our CustomResourceDefinition should be mostly concerned with describing the attributes of our future resource. Additionally, it's good to know that custom resources can be either namespaced or cluster-scoped. This is specified in the CRD's scope field.</p>

If there's anything you'd like to say, be welcome to <a href="#comments">add a comment</a> (at the bottom of the blog post).</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/welcome.png" alt="A welcome to the newsletter, by your host" loading="lazy" width="928" height="550"></p><h2 id="heading-what-we've-been-coding-on">What we've been coding on<a href="#heading-what-we've-been-coding-on"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>If you notice the <a href="https://graphql-api.com/guides/">Guides</a>, section "Extending the GraphQL API" is still pretty empty:</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/guides-extending-section.jpg" alt="Guides for &quot;Extending the plugin&quot; are not yet complete" loading="lazy" width="928" height="965"><figcaption>Guides for 'Extending the plugin' are not yet complete</figcaption></figure><p>My priority is to complete these guides. But before I do that, I want the plugin's code to be as simple as possible. The simpler it is, the less documentation is required, and the more anyone and everyone is able to understand it.</p><p>With this in mind, I've decided to refactor the code, to have it be fully based on <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html">Symfony's DependencyInjection Component</a>.</p><p>The idea is that any extension to the plugin (such as a custom <code>TypeResolver</code>, <code>FieldResolver</code> or <code>DirectiveResolver</code>) is simply defined as a service in the container, and the service is automatically configured via <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/compiler_passes.html">Compiler passes</a>.</p><p>Fully relying on Symfony's dependency injection has several advantages:</p><p>✅ There is a single, consistent way to create extensions<br>✅ Just creating a PHP class implementing some interface does the whole job, and the developer needs not be aware of the nitty-gritty details<br>✅ Symfony's documentation is very extensive. By pointing developers to it, that is documentation that <strong>I do not need to write</strong></p><p>Interested in the code? Check out my latest merged PRs (<a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/pull/453">#453</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/pull/452">#452</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP/pull/449">#449</a> and several others).</p><p>I will keep working on this code for the upcoming weeks, until the migration is 100% complete, and I get to write the missing guides.</p><h2 id="heading-traffic-to-graphql-api.com">Traffic to graphql-api.com<a href="#heading-traffic-to-graphql-api.com"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Let me be clear on something: I care about how many people visit the plugin's website, as a proxy to know how many people know about the plugin.</p><p>I don't have deep pockets to publicize my plugin. And even if I did, I wouldn't spend my money on promoting it, since that goes against the spirit of open source. (This would be different if open source were just a channel to sell some product or service, but that's not my case.)</p><p>That means that I rely fully on word of mouth to promote it. For that, I've been devoting plenty of effort in writing high-quality content for <a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/">the plugin's blog</a>, hoping this content would get shared around, reaching people who would otherwise not know about the plugin.</p><p>And so far, I'm pretty happy with the results.</p><p>During the past month, I've had 4.5k visitors, with 6k page views:</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/traffic.jpg" alt="Show me the money!" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="940"><figcaption>Show me the money!</figcaption></figure><p>Let's break down these stats.</p><p>Most of my visitors come from Hacker News, where I managed to pull a few "Show HN" front pages, and Reddit, mostly from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/">/r/PHP</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/graphql/">/r/graphql</a> (where I always share my articles).</p><p>I managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz/status/1365873932675391488">rank #1 on Google when searching "wordpress core graphql"</a>, and that brought plenty of traffic. Unfortunately, it was a one time-off: after 24hs it went away as suddenly as it arrived. Otherwise, on a typical day I get between 3 and 10 visitors from Google.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook bring a sizable amount of traffic, but I don't know from who (not from me, since I am extremely bad at social media). I do share my articles on Twitter, but they seldom get retweeted. And I do not use 👎🏾 Facebook.</p><p>(Btw, for those of you who share my articles on social media, thanks ❤️)</p><p>I get some modest but consistent traffic from the <a href="https://graphql.org/code/#php">listing of GraphQL servers in PHP on graphql.org</a>, and from <a href="https://dev.to/leoloso/executing-multiple-queries-in-a-single-operation-in-graphql-goe">an article I've published on dev.to</a>, which ranks #1 when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graphql+execute+multiple+queries">googling "graphql execute multiple queries"</a>.</p><p>Finally, my articles consistently appear in WordPress' main newsletters (including <a href="https://wpowls.co/">WP Owls</a>, <a href="https://wpmail.me/">wpMail.me</a>, <a href="https://poststatus.com/newsletter/">Post Status</a>, <a href="https://wpbuilds.com/">WP Builds</a>, and <a href="https://thewpweekly.com/">The WP Weekly</a>). I don't know exactly how much traffic each of them brings, since the referrer will appear as Gmail and similar others. However, when taken together, these newsletters produce a sizable number of visitors.</p><p>My blog posts are by far my most popular content, with the last three (<a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/why-wordpress-should-have-a-graphql-api-in-core/">this one</a>, <a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/graphql-api-vs-wpgraphql-the-fight/">this one</a> and <a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/rejuvenating-wordpress-through-graphql/">this one</a>) bringing over 1k visitors each.</p><p>These numbers look pretty good, more since I barely launched the website less than 2 months ago. However, not everything looks good: At 88%, the bounce rate is quite high. I need to work on that.</p><h2 id="heading-metrics">Metrics<a href="#heading-metrics"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Traffic to the site is only a decorative metric, to estimate awareness of the plugin. But far more important to ask is: How many people started using the plugin during the past month?</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/multiply.png" alt="My reputation precedes me" loading="lazy" width="928" height="550"><figcaption>My reputation precedes me</figcaption></figure><p>During the past month, the plugin fared like this:</p><p>🎯 Number of plugin downloads: 170<br>⭐️ GitHub stars: 27</p><p>The number of downloads can be retrieved from the GitHub API, passing param <code>per_page=3</code> to include only the 3 releases created during the last month:</p><pre><code><span><span>curl</span> -H <span>"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"</span> https://api.github.com/repos/leoloso/PoP/releases?per_page<span>=</span><span>3</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> <span>"download_count"</span></span></code></pre><p>I am neither happy nor unhappy about these numbers. They are not great (and I wish they were better), but they are a good start.</p><p>Concerning <strong>downloads</strong>, it is said that getting the first user is the most difficult task. Only after a few people start using the plugin, and start talking about it, that its use will become more widespread. I am still within this initial stage of finding the first batch of commited users.</p><p>Concerning <strong>GitHub stars</strong>, I must say it looks pretty flat: around 1 star per day on average. This is certainly nothing great. If you like what I'm building with the GraphQL API for WordPress, and you don't mind showing some ❤️ love, then please consider <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP">giving it a ⭐️ star on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="heading-financial-sustainability">Financial Sustainability<a href="#heading-financial-sustainability"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>This one is the tough issue: the project must be financially sustainable. It either generates a bit of money, or it won't make it for long.</p><figure><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/building-in-the-open-episode-1/cheese.png" alt="In this goes my life" loading="lazy" width="928" height="800"><figcaption>In this goes my life</figcaption></figure><p>If I am able to make an income for myself, then I can keep working on it, for as long as needed. That's all I need: an income. Not investors knocking on my door looking for millions. Just a couple thousands per month, to pay for the roof above my head.</p><p>My goal is to keep the plugin fully open source. For that, I'm currently reaching out to a couple of potential sponsors, asking if they'd like to help fund the development of the plugin. It will be a win-win situation.</p><p>Why am I resorting to some "big guns" sponsors, instead of relying on regular sponsorship, by anyone from the community?</p><p>Yes, I've been trying that too: I am on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/leoloso">GitHub Sponsors</a>. However, it doesn't really work, unless you already have thousands of users, followers, or people subscribed to your mailing list, to whom you can reach out to, expecting many of them to fund you.</p><p>For instance, asking for a standard u$d 5 or 10 per month, I'd need several hundred funders for this approach to fund my work. And I'm nowhere near that stage.</p><p>But even more, who can really succeed with this approach? I know that Caleb Porzio (creator of Livewire) <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">has made it</a>, and has now <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/calebporzio#sponsors">reached over 1350 sponsors</a>! But that's more the exception than the norm.</p><p>Take Composer, for instance. Composer has fundamentally changed how we develop PHP applications, yet <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/composer">they barely have 90 sponsors</a>. How could I ever expect to get more sponsors than Composer?</p><p>That's why my current approach is to create a win-win situation for my project and the few companies willing to sponsor it. Let's hope it will work out, and the GraphQL API is free for everyone, for all the features, and I don't need to lock the good stuff behind a paywall.</p><p>(If you'd like to find out how it's a win-win, please <a href="https://graphql-api.com/contact">send me an email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz">DM</a>. Maybe your company may be interested too?)</p><p>I'll give this approach a few months, hopefully I will make it happen. If I don't succeed, only then I will need to consider building a PRO version of the plugin, and restricting some of the features for the paid version. (Yeah, that would suck, so I hope I can avoid that stage.)</p><p>In the upcoming newsletters, I will keep you updated if I managed to get sponsors or not.</p><h2 id="heading-blog-posts">Blog posts<a href="#heading-blog-posts"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The blog posts have been my absolute pride and joy.</p><p><strong>Heads up:</strong> Did you know there's an <a href="https://graphql-api.com/feed.xml">RSS feed on the site</a>? You can subscribe to receiving all my blog posts, read them on your favorite reader.</p><p>During the past month, I've managed to publish a high-quality blog post every week:</p><p><a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/why-wordpress-should-have-a-graphql-api-in-core/">🛠 Should WordPress have a GraphQL API in core?</a> makes the case that WordPress could benefit from GraphQL, since the WP REST API was given a new functionality in WordPress 5.6 (batch operations), that a GraphQL API can deliver natively.</p><p><a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/graphql-api-vs-wpgraphql-the-fight/">🥊 GraphQL API vs WPGraphQL: the fight!</a> compares my plugin with <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a>, on a clash to be remembered for ages to come, and which will keep boxing fans asking for more.</p><p><a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/rejuvenating-wordpress-through-graphql/">👶🏻 Rejuvenating WordPress through GraphQL</a> demonstrates how a headless WordPress can be decoupled from the WordPress codebase, providing an opportunity to fix (or, at least, bypass) the accumulated technical debt.</p><p><a href="https://graphql-api.com/blog/graphql-api-for-wp-is-now-scoped-thanks-to-php-scoper/">🍾 GraphQL API for WordPress is now scoped, thanks to PHP-Scoper!</a> describes a strategy to scope a WordPress plugin using <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>, as to avoid conflicts with other plugins.</p><h2 id="heading-reaching-out-plugin-mentions">Reaching out / Plugin mentions<a href="#heading-reaching-out-plugin-mentions"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>I'm delighted that the plugin has been featured in a few places.</p><p>✅ I have given talk "Intro to the GraphQL API for WordPress" in WordCamp India 2021, doing a demo of the plugin, and (surprisingly from doing a demo) it all came out perfectly!

"If there was a Nobel Prize for ecology, he would've won it."&nbsp;</p>    <p>Schindler lived&nbsp;in Brisco, B.C., with his wife Suzanne Bayley.&nbsp;He died Thursday at 80.</p>  <p>Tributes began to flood social media on Thursday night, with colleagues and admirers crediting Schindler with spurring the creation of many of Canada's&nbsp;water protections.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>My good friend and fishing companion, David Schindler, died today.

Before his appointment, he headed the Experimental Lakes Area project in Ontario, which&nbsp;provided evidence of the role of phosphorus in fish-killing algae blooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>An aerial photo of the project, which juxtaposed the clear and algae-clouded sides of Lake 226, was credited by Arizona State University biologist James Elser as the "the single most powerful image in the history of limnology."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2098704.1614965846!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/lake226-curtain.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2098704.1614965846!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/lake226-curtain.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2098704.1614965846!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/lake226-curtain.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2098704.1614965846!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/lake226-curtain.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2098704.1614965846!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/lake226-curtain.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2098704.1614965846!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/lake226-curtain.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>During an experiment in August 1973, Lake 226 in the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario is divided by a plastic curtain.

But inspired by Charles Elton's seminal work on invasive biology, he transferred into the zoology program at North Dakota State University. He then went on to study under Elton at Oxford University, where he graduated with his doctorate in 1968.</p>  <h2>'Playing chess with a gorilla'</h2>  <p>But despite the credentials, Vinebrooke says Schindler&nbsp;was not interested in having his work cloistered inside the ivory tower. Instead, he pursued projects, such as Experimental Lakes, that would make ecology accessible to the public, following in the steps of Elton and Rachel Carson's<em> Silent Spring</em>, another significant influence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"He always put it in some sort of a context where it could benefit greater human society," said Vinebrooke, professor of aquatic ecology at the University of Alberta.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That commitment to vocal public education often put him at odds with politicians, including&nbsp;a clash with then-Premier Ralph Klein in the 1990s over pulp mill contamination in the Athabasca River. He would go on to criticize the rollback of water protections under Prime Minister Stephen Harper and castigate what he called the disregard for treaty rights in the oilsands, according to his Order of Canada biography.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the science was always more fun than&nbsp;the public forays, Schindler told the CBC in a 2010 profile.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It isn't in hassling with politicians and that, which is to me rather like playing chess with a gorilla. The game is boring and you know you are going to win, but you have to be prepared to duck once in a while when they get angry and take a swing at you," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In a three-part reflection authored on the eve of his retirement in 2013, Schindler issued an entreaty to young scientists to take up the cause of preserving earth's biodiversity and to question the "shameless promotion of growth and consumption."&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So, future scientists, we desperately need your help to show us the way," he said. "The future of our species, our province, our country and our planet are at stake."&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

   Visual design updates that are more than skin&nbsp;deep

  <section>
    <p>When a new major version of some piece of software is released, there is often an immediate focus put on visual changes. If there aren’t a ton of new and shinies, social media will inevitably be filled with words like “stale,” “old,” and “outdated.” This has become especially true for elementary OS, whose visual design hasn’t really changed all that much over the years. At elementary, we tend to avoid making changes for the sake of change. We’re very skeptical about design trends, and do our best to create things that feel a bit more “evergreen.” After all, “Good design is long lasting” and this allows us to focus more on refining than constantly reinventing. We also have a third-party developer community to think about, and making sweeping visual changes means that the nearly 200 apps in AppCenter will have to be updated and tested to make sure they still look as intended. So, when we decided to work on the look and feel for elementary OS 6, we wanted to approach things with a lot of intentionality, avoiding trends and focusing on setting the stage for the next several years.</p>



<p>App developers rely on pre-made widgets to do a lot of the heavy lifting and provide good default styles when making their apps. In addition to the widgets provided by GTK, we also ship our GTK companion library Granite that makes replicating common elementary design patterns a breeze. In elementary OS 6, we’re also making heavy use of Handy—a library that was originally developed by Purism for mobile interfaces but has now become a core part of the GNOME app development platform on the desktop. Thanks to Handy, we have two major, obvious visual design improvements that developers can adopt.</p>



<p>We’ve long had plans to modernize the Granite Avatar widget. A continual problem we’ve faced is that many people just don’t set an avatar for their user account. As a consequence, we need a more meaningful fallback design that allows avatars to be distinct and useful in apps like Mail or in System Settings. As it turns out, the folks behind Handy had the same thoughts and the work was largely already done. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exalm">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> was very helpful and gracious in implementing changes in Handy to achieve the exact style we wanted, and I’m happy to say that we now have much more colorful interfaces in elementary OS 6 thanks to Handy Avatar, even if people don’t set avatar images.</p>

<p>The other obvious change is more rounded bottom window corners. This seems like something that would be simple, but is actually not possible in vanilla GTK3. In elementary OS 5, we used clever workarounds for specific cases to give dialogs and other flat windows rounded corners all the way around. But in elementary OS 6, we can now have rounded bottom corners even in complex cases like Camera, thanks to Hdy.Window. It’s a small thing, but it definitely makes the whole UI feel just a bit more polished.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>

<p>The default typefaces in elementary OS have also been changed for the first time since our initial brand work. Instead of Open Sans with Raleway for headers, we’ve unified on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>: a new, modern typeface specifically designed for use in user interfaces on computer screens. The designer, Rasmus Andersson, actively updates Inter and has been very responsive on GitHub. He’s even weighed in on our use of Inter in elementary OS, and his feedback has led to changes in the weights we use for various headers.</p>

<p>We’ve also revisited the default font rendering settings, opting for grayscale anti-aliasing over RGB; this addresses some issues we’ve seen with ghosting/leaking of colors around text, especially visible when using transparency. You’ll find that in general, text is bolder, higher contrast, and more legible in elementary OS 6.</p>

<h2 id="iconography">Iconography</h2>

<p>The visual style for our icons has remained largely unchanged, with more focus put on internal consistency. You’ll notice subtle improvements such as a more consistent use of our color palette, plus more gender-neutral depictions of a “user” in places like System Settings.</p>

<figure>

<p>A long outstanding issue has been wrangling all the different styles of arrows that we’ve used over the years. There are hundreds of arrow icons in the elementary icon set, used across many different contexts. We provide both full color and flat, symbolic icons and in a range of different sizes. There are even different kinds of arrow tails depending on context, or no tail at all. In elementary OS 6, we have one new shape to rule them all and we’ve given arrows more rounded corners.</p>

  </picture>

</figure>

<p>In arrows with curved tails, such as in Mail tool icons, the area under the curve is larger, making the shape more recognizeable at small sizes or for folks with less acute vision. We’ve also reduced busy overlap and improved separation in symbolic icons, which now match their full color counterparts much more closely.</p>

</figure>

<p>We’re rounding out corners and using bolder shapes in other places as well. The new media controls icons for example feel much more weighty, and the lightning bolt symbol used on power icons is more distinct. Historically, going into more detail hasn’t been as important on LoDPI displays, but the new shapes really shine on displays with more pixels available.</p>

<h2 id="stylesheet">Stylesheet</h2>

<p>One recurring bit of feedback that we’ve received is that in general, the stylesheet in elementary OS 5 is somewhat low contrast. Low contrast can make it hard to read text for visually impaired users, but it can also be a large problem on lower quality displays. Contrast between widgets and their backgrounds can also help clearly define different parts of an application, and especially which of those parts are interactive. Addressing these concerns is part of our larger project to make elementary OS 6 more accessible by default, which we’ve written about previously.</p>



<p>To ensure we achieve the desired contrast, we created a design system built on UI levels. With a little bit of Sass magic, we can style widgets by picking a background level—such as 0 for inputs or 4 for toolbars—and then overlaying a white gradient and adding a shadow—which also comes in various levels. The overall result is a style that is a bit flatter on the surface of each layer, but overall more consistent in its use of depth, and with much more consistent and expressive use of shadows between layers.</p>

</figure>

<p>Another place for more clear differentiation is in widget states. Interfaces are interactive: they can be selected, disabled, focused, or pressed. We started some work towards more clearly differentiated states in elementary OS 5 when we redesigned checkboxes, and in elementary OS 6 this work has extended to other interactive widgets like text entries and buttons. Disabled widgets, for example, are much more obviously darker than the default UI level, and are intentionally lower contrast than enabled widgets.</p>

</figure>

<p>Something we knew we needed to consider from very early on was a path towards making elementary OS feel more personal without breaking custom styles in apps. We know that many of our users are currently using custom CSS, but that it often leads to breakage and disappointment. In elementary OS 6, we provide 10 possible accent colors to choose from. Combined with the dark style, you can get a much more unique look for your operating system without having to worry about apps behaving incorrectly. The dark style follows all the same principles as outlined above including UI levels, using higher contrast, etc. And we’re still exploring more ways to expose your chosen accent color in ways that feel fun and personal.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Focus styles are still a work in progress, but the goal here is to make much more bold use of color and to make the keyboard focus location much more obvious. We’ve also revisited selected states and suggested action button styles to make sure that we’re clearly differentiating between someone’s strawberry accent color and destructive action buttons. Instead of using white text on a colored background, we now use a much subtler style that is ultimately higher contrast as well. It also works much better for accent colors, custom brand colors in apps, or other places where we want to use color such as Calendar events.</p>

<p>We also hear regularly from users who have displays that sit in that uncomfortable zone between 1× and 2× UI scaling. While we’re still not offering traditional fractional scaling in elementary OS, we have been working on an improved scalable UI solution. In elementary OS 5, people who opted to change the default text size were left with an awkwardly spaced UI with large text, but small controls. In elementary OS 6, we now scale default widgets spacing, corner radii, etc. with text size, eliminating a lot of that awkwardness. It’s not quite perfect, but it will make elementary OS much more legible for more people without incurring the performance penalty associated with traditional fractional scaling. And we’re happy to have a more first-class experience for those who need larger text.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology, to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.</p>

<hr>

<p>Product, experience, interaction, industrial designers, creative technologists. If somehow you are a creative interested in making things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the Bauhaus. It’s also because of that school and their influence on art education that we can enjoy things designed by people with an artistic sensibility. Rather than only having things designed by engineers.</p>

<p>At the time, few artists were willing to collaborate with the industry to create mass-manufactured objects. Architect Walter Gropius, founder and director of the school, was especially passionate about social architecture and in general in creating things for the common people. Mass-manufacturing technology could allow that at scale. So some years after the creation of the school, he adjusted the focus in the Bauhaus curriculum. And since 1925, when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, the school new motto became ‘Art and technology: a new unity’.</p>

<hr>

<p>But despite the ambition of the Bauhaus to teach students how to design for the industry, few of the tutors at the time had experience in industrial production. The school method was still based on a combination of applied arts and academic education, and the students’ practical lessons were given by craftsmen whose experience was in making things by hand and not in designing for production.</p>

<p>For instance, in the metal workshop under Moholy-Nagy, students would handmade prototypes with a style they thought would be easy to reproduce industrially. For instance using spheres, cylinders and other basic shapes. Except that due to their ignorance of industrial processes, those objects were hard to make in a mass-production facility.</p>

<p>But the strongest critique of the Bauhaus lack of technological knowledge was Buckminster Fuller. Fuller was familiar with the work of the Bauhaus due to the Black Mountain College in the US, where he and other former Bauhaus tutors were teaching. According to him, the ‘International Style’ brought to the US by the Bauhaus, simple replaced the previous decorative style with a new simplified one made of basic shapes and colours. A new exterior, but that was leaving unchanged the structural and functional elements of the building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short they only looked at problems of modifications of the surface of end-product, which end-products were inherently sub-functions of a technically obsolete world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Obviously, Bucky did all the things he was criticising Gropius and the Bauhaus about. But that’s a story I’ll save for some other time).</p>

<hr>

<p>The excitement of the Bauhauslers for new technologies is still present among designers now. And so is that limit in understanding fully a new innovation that can be used in a new product or service. I feel that every time I’m working with machine learning. But what the Bauhaus achieved was to get artists interested in bringing their sensibility in the creative use of technology. And whatever Bucky thinks, that remains.</p>

<p>
Welcome to the first edition of our online reading session. This is a
tiny book club. In the first edition, we will be diving into the
beautiful world of <em>number theory</em>.
</p>



<p>
  <small>
  †
  The Matrix room and Freenode channel are bridged together, so if you
  join one of them, you will automatically receive the updates and
  messages from the other one too. If you are not an active Freenode
  user, prefer joining the Matrix room because it is more convenient,
  e.g., you can close your browser or client and your chat session will
  still stay alive. You can connect back the next day and catch up with
  the messages. Doing that with Freenode IRC requires slightly more work
  (setting up IRC bouncers etc.).
  </small>
</p>


<h2 id="reference">Reference Material<a href="#reference"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary reference book for these meetings is going to be:
<em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom M.
Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may find a
relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites. A DRM-free
PDF eBook is available for purchase at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633">springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are unable to buy the reference book, you can still participate
in this book club activity by downloading freely available notes from
  the University of Illinois: <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/main.pdf">main.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
For solutions to exercise problems, refer to this excellent PDF created
by Greg Hurst: <a href="https://greghurst.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/apostol_intro_to_ant.pdf">apostol_intro_to_ant.pdf</a>.
</p>

    <h3>
      Who are you?
      <a href="#faq-who"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I am <a href="https://susam.in/">Susam</a>. I am just someone
      who enjoys mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs and wants to spread the
      joy of spending time with these beautiful things. I have been
      working as an information security professional for about 15
      years. Of these 15 years, close to 7 years were spent working with
      probability theory, calculus, and combinatorics, and another 3
      years in implementation of cryptographic utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do a lot of teaching as hobby. This is my way of giving
      something back to the technology community. I have taught Common
      Lisp, Emacs, Python, C, Vim, and various areas of mathematics. In
      each one of my previous workplaces, I have created communities
      around mathematics, algorithms, and/or, cryptography. In the
      online world, I created the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/##algorithms">##algorithms</a>
      channel on Freenode IRC (my nick there is <code>spal</code>). What
      started as a tiny hobby club around algorithms 13 years ago is now
      a thriving community with over 200 members. (Disclosure: I don't
      participate in it anymore but a highly talented group of
      moderators helps maintain the channel).
    </p>
    <p>
      These hobbies of teaching and forming local and online communities
      have also led me to write some open source projects. Some are
      mildly popular and some not so popular but have managed to find
      its own niche community of users. For example, <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> and <a href="http://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a> were born out of the need to
      share mathematics problems and solutions within these communities.
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a> was born when I
      used to teach Vim and I wanted Windows users to have a good
      ergonomic experience. Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a> was born
      while teaching Common Lisp with Emacs and SLIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, I work in information security by profession and I
      am an open source software developer by hobby. I want to use some
      part of my leisure time in hosting book club meetings where we
      pick up good books and work through them together.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-why">
    <h3>
      Why are you doing this?
      <a href="#faq-why"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the course of my career and hobbies, I have found
      Mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs to be extraordinarily elegant and
      beautiful and it is my goal to introduce as many people to these
      things as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software development these days focus a lot around stitching
      together many libraries to accomplish complex tasks. I understand
      that this is more economical and productive. This approach has
      certainly made it possible to develop huge and complex
      software-based infrastructure that has changed the way we live.
      However, I think, in this fast-paced software development world,
      the simpler joys of devising or implementing algorithms from
      scratch and appreciating the underlying beauty of mathematics is
      taking a backseat. I intend to introduce more and more people to
      some of these simpler joys, especially, the joy of unravelling the
      mysteries of prime numbers, appreciating the simplicity and
      elegance of Lisp, experiencing the remarkable extensibility of
      Emacs, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the more I help others work though a formidable book like
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>, the more it helps
      me too to appreciate some finer and deeper points that I may not
      have paid due attention to when I read the book for the first
      time. So I benefit from these reading sessions too. Similarly, the
      more I help someone with Common Lisp programming, the more I have
      to dive into the Common Lisp HyperSpec which often teaches me a
      few new things too, so I gain from the experience too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-book">
    <h3>
      Have you read the entire book?
      <a href="#faq-book"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read approximately half of the book (Introduction to
      Analytic Number Theory) and I am enjoying it so far. This means
      that I am a good number of chapters ahead of someone who has just
      begun reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the
      reading sessions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas
      of confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-lisp">
    <h3>
      You mentioned Lisp. Can you do a book club for it?
      <a href="#faq-lisp"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Lisp and Emacs are two other areas at the top of my mind.
      Once there has been sufficient progress in the number theory book
      club, I plan to start a Lisp one next. Join the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">Matrix
      room</a> or <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">follow me
      on Twitter</a> to receive further updates about this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-but">
    <h3>
      But I want to do group reading sessions for another book!
      <a href="#faq-but"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start your own book club around it! This is mine. I have chosen
      number theory as the topic of discussion for now. After a few
      months, I will move on to topics around Lisp and Emacs. If you
      have a different topic or book in mind, start your own book club
      for it. You can reuse my channels (see top of this page) for it or
      you can do it your own way. If you let me know about it and if I
      can find the time, I will join your book club too! I think, we
      need more book clubs, not less!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      Will these sessions be recorded?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not at this time because we often refer to a few pages of the book
      via screen sharing during the reading session. I don't know the
      copyright implications of recording such sessions as videos and
      sharing them with everyone online. If you have expertise in this
      area, I would like to know if my concern is genuine and if there
      is a way to resolve it.
    </p>

March 6, 2021 | https://macwright.com/2021/03/05/immutable-approaches.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://macwright.com/2021/03/05/immutable-approaches.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>These are some rough thoughts on how to do immutability in programming, to power undo. If you’re looking for an opinionated ‘this is how to do it’ sort of post, I’ve written that <a href="https://macwright.com/2015/05/18/practical-undo.html">about Immutable.js</a>. This is more a publicly-shared scratchpad.</em></p><p>For the fourth or so time in my career, I’m thinking about and implementing an ‘undo’ function. Undo is a powerful feature because it lets people do destructive or major operations without worrying because they can just hit command-z. Implementing undo is a subtle challenge for both UX &amp; algorithms.</p><p>I don’t think that my standard approach, in-memory immutability, is the way to go anymore.</p><h3 id="in-memory-immutability">In-memory immutability</h3><div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>myself</span> <span>=</span> <span>Immutable</span><span>.</span><span>Map</span><span>({</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Tom</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>favoriteColor</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span> <span>});</span>
<span>const</span> <span>you</span> <span>=</span> <span>myself</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>You</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>This is what was in <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD">iD</a>, and basically what’s described in that <a href="https://macwright.com/2015/05/18/practical-undo.html">old post about Immutable.js</a>. Whenever data changes in your application, instead of changing it in-place, you make a new copy, change that copy, and store the old copy as the undo state.</p><p>Using Immutable.js in Mapbox Studio made me appreciate its power, but also revealed the drawbacks. It makes certain things faster, like manipulating data structures and comparing instances, but other things a lot slower, like transforming immutable data back to normal JavaScript data structures with <code>.toJS()</code>. And it wasn’t easy to use with the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flow">Flow</a> type system, which we were using at the time. Immutable objects in a fancy wrapper were hard to make type assertions about, and it’s probably not much better with TypeScript.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>myself</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Tom</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>favoriteColor</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span> <span>};</span>
<span>const</span> <span>you</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span><span>myself</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>You</span><span>"</span> <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I’ve also realized that I can simply be diligent about data structures and do immutability <em>in JavaScript</em> by making sure simply not to mutate data. In development, I can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze">Object.freeze</a> to catch accidental mutations. With ES6’s nice <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spread syntax</a>, it’s simple to create little copies of objects and arrays instead of mutating the original.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/immerjs/immer">Immer</a> seems like the middle ground between hand-crafted diligent immutability and the full-fledged Immutable.js system. Immer seems like a nice tool, but I’m happy to just be careful hand-crafting code instead.</p><h3 id="json-patch">JSON Patch</h3><p>Immutable.js, hand-crafted immutability, and Immer are all different flavors of immutable objects in memory. They all rely to some degree on sharing old parts of mutated objects to keep memory low. They all work pretty well.</p><p>But at the core, they’re in-memory representations. If you refresh your browser, your undo history is toast. Also, you have these snapshots of the system state at each moment, but no representation of what the changes between those snapshots are - so you can’t save just the <em>change</em> to the server. You have to save the whole new object. It’d be nice if there was a way to represent changes.</p><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">JSON patch</a> is one option. There’s a really solid implementation in <a href="https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch">fast-json-patch</a>.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>document</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Tom</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>favoriteColor</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span> <span>};</span>
<span>var</span> <span>patch</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>replace</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>/name</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>You</span><span>"</span> <span>}];</span>
<span>document</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsonpatch</span><span>.</span><span>applyPatch</span><span>(</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>patch</span><span>).</span><span>newDocument</span><span>;</span>
<span>// document == { name: "You", favoriteColor: "red" };</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>JSON Patch’s “operations” are objects, like <code>patch</code> in this example, that you can apply to a document to change it. There’s a lot of exciting potential here. Even if you’re very careful with your Immutable.js or hand-written data transformations, old versions of your data still hanging out in memory.</p><p>With JSON Patch, the change history is representable in JSON, so you could stash it in IndexedDB to keep it out of memory. And you can save changes - as patch objects, not as complete new versions - to the server. No longer is immutability so dependent on keeping everything in memory.</p><h3 id="ot--crdt">OT &amp; CRDT</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Operational transforms</a> are pretty similar to what we used at <a href="http://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>. They’re like JSON Patches, but with the added property that you use them for collaboration. If multiple people are working on the document at once, you have an approach to receive &amp; share all their changes and resolve potential conflicts.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a> are even fancier, and are the subject of some controversy. Unlike operational transforms, they can work without even a central server. They are, however, complicated and hard to optimize. There’s a <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/">very impressive project, Yjs</a>, which implements CRDTs.</p><p>The gameplan with CRDTs or some Operational Transform implementation is that you would implement ‘multiplayer editing’ and other forms of collaboration with the same basic infrastructure as you implement undo &amp; redo functionality, because in order to send around small changes between the server &amp; clients, you’re also recording all edits as those standardized changes. There are some emerging examples of this, like <a href="https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/1367939151300005894">Actual budget</a>.</p><h3 id="the-database-quandary">The database quandary</h3><p>Finally, something that I think is tricky. If you use one of these approaches, whether it’s JSON Patch, a CRDT, or OT, you’re storing all of these tiny changes in a database. So traditionally, when you show a document you’ll be loading many tiny changes and then re-running those changes (like <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a>, kind of).</p><p>The bottleneck here is obvious: the longer the document’s history, the more changes you have to load and apply. A document that someone has edited 2,000 times becomes a lot slower to load than one someone just created, even if they documents end up being the same length.</p><p>You can speed this up with caching, but I’m really wondering about (and not finding, so far), solutions in which a Postgres extension or some feature of a database could process your CRDT or OT states <em>internally</em> using, basically something like a window function, like <a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Extent.html">ST_Extent</a> does to aggregate geographic data.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>There is something charming about games using their desktop platform's standard windows and controls for the user interface.  It is even more so if they use the limited standard palette.  This page tries to convey their charm.</p>

<p>The release dates are for the initial release of the game unless indicated otherwise.</p>

        <p><img src="https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_11p1s4/styles/communityIcon_82qz1x1k5uj41.png" alt="SerenityOS Logo"></p>

<p>Recently I have taken an interest in a project called SerenityOS. Stolen straight from the <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SerenityOS is a love letter to ’90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix. This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a surprisingly featured hobby operating system with quite a welcoming community behind it. It caught my radar after a series of videos by LiveOverflow and Andreas (the developer) detailing a few exploits made during the <a href="https://hxp.io/blog/79/hxp-CTF-2020-wisdom2/">2020 hxp CTF</a>, so I decided to explore the system myself. Eventually, I found a memory corruption bug in some networking code that could be leveraged into kernel-mode code execution.</p>

<p>The vulnerability can be hit so easily by some bad code that I’m surprised it wasn’t found by a fuzzer immediately. At its core, it’s a stack overflow in the function <code>TCPSocket::send_tcp_packet</code>. To see how, let’s take a look at the implementation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">KResult TCPSocket<span>::</span>send_tcp_packet(u16 flags, <span>const</span> UserOrKernelBuffer<span>*</span> payload, size_t payload_size)
{
    <span>const</span> size_t buffer_size <span>=</span> <span>sizeof</span>(TCPPacket) <span>+</span> payload_size;
    <span>alignas</span>(TCPPacket) u8 buffer[buffer_size];
    <span>new</span> (buffer) TCPPacket;
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> tcp_packet <span>=</span> <span>*</span>(TCPPacket<span>*</span>)(buffer);
    ASSERT(local_port());
    tcp_packet.set_source_port(local_port());
    tcp_packet.set_destination_port(peer_port());
    tcp_packet.set_window_size(<span>1024</span>);
    tcp_packet.set_sequence_number(m_sequence_number);
    tcp_packet.set_data_offset(<span>sizeof</span>(TCPPacket) <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span>(u32));
    tcp_packet.set_flags(flags);
    <span>//...
</span><span></span>    <span>if</span> (payload <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>payload<span>-&gt;</span>read(tcp_packet.payload(), payload_size))
        <span>return</span> EFAULT;
    <span>//...
</span><span></span>    <span>if</span> (tcp_packet.has_syn() <span>||</span> payload_size <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>) {
        <span>//...
</span><span></span>        send_outgoing_packets();
        <span>return</span> KSuccess;
    }
    <span>//...
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>This function is called when attempting to use the <code>send()</code> syscall on a TCP socket (naturally). None of the parent callers in the chain (<code>Process::sys$sendmsg</code>, <code>IPv4Socket::sendto</code>, and <code>TCPSocket::protocol_send</code>) do any bounds checking on the user-provided <code>payload_size</code> other than ensuring the value is in userspace. Unfortunately, a value being in userspace is quite a lax requirement when then using the value to make a stack allocation. The problem line is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>alignas</span>(TCPPacket) u8 buffer[buffer_size];
</code></pre></div><p><code>buffer</code> is then a Variable-length Array (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_array">VLA</a>) which is a really cursed feature from C99 that is as bad as it sounds. It attempts to dynamically resize the stack-frame using the value we provided, which can do some very unexpected things when the value is larger than the stack size (Serenity seems to use a stack size of 2^16 in the kernel). We can thus easily obliterate the stack and trigger a crash by calling something to the effect of:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">send(tcp_socket, user_buffer, <span>0xdeadaa</span>, <span>0</span>); <span>//BOOM!
</span></code></pre></div><p>This is all well and good, but can we actually do something useful with this? First and foremost, we need to make sure there’s no funny business going on with the allocation itself. Examining the code produced by gcc:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="r"><span>...</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>+749</span><span>&gt;:</span> test   eax,eax
<span>&lt;</span><span>+751</span><span>&gt;:</span> jg     <span>0xc018a36f</span> <span>&lt;</span>Kernel<span>::</span>TCPSocket<span>::</span><span>send_tcp_packet</span>(unsigned short, Kernel<span>::</span>UserOrKernelBuffer const<span>*</span>, unsigned long)<span>+771</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>+762</span><span>&gt;:</span> push   eax
<span>&lt;</span><span>+763</span><span>&gt;:</span> call   <span>0xc01e08e2</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>__ubsan_handle_vla_bound_not_positive</span>()<span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>+771</span><span>&gt;:</span> mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp<span>-0</span>x70]
<span>&lt;</span><span>+774</span><span>&gt;:</span> lea    esi,[ebp<span>-0</span>x58]
<span>&lt;</span><span>+777</span><span>&gt;:</span> add    eax,<span>0xf</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>+780</span><span>&gt;:</span> and    eax,<span>0xfffffff0</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>+785</span><span>&gt;:</span> lea    eax,[ebp<span>-0</span>x70]
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Seems to do exactly as advertised, just a <code>sub esp</code> with our value (and with the shiny UB sanitizer attached). So now that we can be confident the allocation won’t mess with any memory, the next step is using it safely. Nearly right after the allocation, we have our userspace buffer being copied into the kernel buffer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>if</span> (payload <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>payload<span>-&gt;</span>read(tcp_packet.payload(), payload_size))
    <span>return</span> EFAULT;
</code></pre></div><p>This could be bad news for us <em>if</em> we provide a valid-sized user buffer because then we’d at the very least hit the guard page below the stack and fail. But that’s a big <em>if</em>. Providing a non-valid user buffer is totally fair game, too. How would the kernel know? What I mean by this is that our buffer isn’t as long as we say it is. The result is that as <code>payload-&gt;read</code> attempts to copy over our bytes, it’ll fault when it hits our bad memory. But this time, the fault will be on the <em>user side</em>, meaning the function will gracefully exit on the kernel’s end.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">u8<span>*</span> stack_smash <span>=</span> (u8<span>*</span>)mmap(<span>nullptr</span>, ST_BUFFER_LEN, PROT_READ <span>|</span> PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED <span>|</span> MAP_ANONYMOUS, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, <span>0</span>);
...
send(socket_fd, stack_smash, send_len, <span>0</span>); <span>//send_len is much, much larger than ST_BUFFER_LEN!
</span></code></pre></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/patrickwardle">@patrickwardle</a> has a nice visual of this regarding a similar idea on macOS:</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvYgh2MVIAYT_8I?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="macOS partial write"></p>
<p>This is wonderful, as this chain of events means we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>sub esp</code> with a user-controlled value</li>
<li>An arbitrary write with another user-controlled value/length</li>
<li>A graceful exit</li>
</ul>
<p>I reported the <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5310">issue</a> and it was fixed within 15 minutes. This guy is a beast!</p>
<p>Now we have all the tools necessary to exploit this :)</p>

<p>We have essentially what is an arbitrary write primitive, so first we must choose what we want to write to. We have to keep in mind that we are writing from an offset from the stack, though, which might make things a little unpredictable. Thankfully, there is little to no KASLR on the system (as far as I’ve seen) but general system noise and randomness make specific writes fairly difficult. That makes directly writing to a critical structure out of the question, but what about staying in the realm of the stack? As the bug is a stack overflow we can’t write to anything already on our stack (as it continues to grow downwards), but I did notice the offsets between stacks seems to remain constant:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cs">...
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc35df000
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc35f0000
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc3601000
<span>[#0 SystemServer(5:5)]</span>: Created kernel stack: <span>0</span>xc3612000
...
</code></pre></div><p>The offset is 0x11000, which is just the stack size 0x10000 plus the guard page size 0x1000. And so, if we can’t write to our own stack… we can still write to another process stack fairly reliably. It then just becomes a case of winning a race condition between what the other process is doing and the write that we do. This is not a problem however as we control the ‘victim’ process, so we can just make it do something as trivial as call sleep, giving us an arbitrary race window. There is also one final annoyance of some randomization that is done whenever we call a syscall:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// Apply a random offset in the range 0-255 to the stack pointer,
</span><span>// to make kernel stacks a bit less deterministic.
</span><span>// Since this is very hot code, request random data in chunks instead of
</span><span>// one byte at a time. This is a noticeable speedup.
</span><span></span><span>if</span> (g_random_byte_buffer_offset <span>==</span> RandomByteBufferSize) {
    get_fast_random_bytes(g_random_byte_buffer, RandomByteBufferSize);
    g_random_byte_buffer_offset <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>This slight randomization to the stack bases makes writing to an exact address of the victim’s stack unreliable (granted, it could be brute-forced in a millisecond). But once again the stars align as the sleep syscall does not care very much about how the stack is laid out as it returns. During its call, it eventually reaches the function <code>Processor::switch_context</code>, which is the final stage before swapping contexts. In it, it does:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="r"><span>...</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>+159</span><span>&gt;:</span> pushf  
<span>&lt;</span><span>+160</span><span>&gt;:</span> push   ebx

Accuracy doesn’t matter here, we can just spray the stack with a new stack pointer and have it return from there… code execution! At this point, we just need to put a ROP chain in some kernel memory and have the stack be redirected to there. I chose to just spray some heap memory with the ROP, but this part was extremely iffy. The offset between the current stack and the heap is not something I could reasonably predict so I had to pretty much blast the entire heap with the code. I used something like a nop sled but with a bunch of rets instead (a ret sled?) to make the ROP chain execution reliable but it would still crash half the time if the offset was too large and I wrote to some bad memory. There’s probably a better way to store the ROP but for my purposes, it will suffice.</p>
<p>The ROP chain I ended up with was very similar to the one in vakzz’s awesome <a href="https://devcraft.io/2021/02/11/serenityos-writing-a-full-chain-exploit.html">exploit chain</a>, writing root to our processes permission bits.</p>

<p>The results of this experiment are not exactly close to my target as you can see, but I thought it was worth a blog post anyway. There was this rough idea I’ve been thinking about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> for a really long time.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if it's possible to use some kind of stochastic algorithm that gives you an initial state which forms legible text after many cycles.</p>— yakinavault (@yakinavault) <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinavault/status/1291586306489761792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>I came across <a href="https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html">an article</a> of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I thought I could do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow “program” a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?</p>

<p>There are other ways of achieving this. One is by placing still life states at specific pixels as described in this <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/38573/paint-a-still-life-or-a-moving-one-draw-an-image-in-the-game-of-life">codegolf question</a>.</p>

<p>What I’m thinking of is to display Mona Lisa for a single frame/generation of ‘non-still’ Game of Life.</p>



<p>I began working on a proof of concept using the hill climbing algorithm. The idea was very simple. Iteratively modify a random 2D Game of Life state until it’s Nth generation looks similar to Mona Lisa. Here’s the full algorithm.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    best_score := infinity
    target := mona lisa with dimensions m x n
    canvas := random matrix of m x n
    best_result := canvas
    do
        modified_canvas := Copy of canvas with a single random cell inverted
        nth_modified_canvas := Run N generations of Game of Life modified_canvas
        Compute a score of how close nth_modified_canvas is with target
        if score &lt; best_score then
        	best_score := score
            best_result := modified_canvas
        canvas := best_result
    while(max_iterations limit passed or best_score &lt; threshold)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hacked up a single core prototype.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>def modify(canvas, shape):
    x,y = shape
    px = int(np.random.uniform(x+1))-1
    py = int(np.random.uniform(y+1))-1
    canvas[px][py] = not canvas[px][py]
    return canvas

def rmse(predictions,targets):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions-targets)**2))

while best_score&gt;limit:
    canvases = np.tile(np.copy(best_seed), (batch_size, 1, 1))
    rms_errors = []
    for canvas in range(len(canvases)):
        canvases[canvas] = modify(states[state], (m,n))
        rmse_val = rmse(target, nth_generation(np.copy(canvases[canvas])))
        rms_errors.append(rmse_val)
    lowest = min(rms_errors)
    if lowest &lt; best_score:
        best_score = lowest
        best_result = canvases[rms_errors.index(lowest)]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hill Climbing works by finding the closest neighboring state to a current state with the least error from a ‘target_state’ (Mona Lisa). The way I find the closest neighbor in every step is to create a copy of the best solution we have so far and invert a random cell. This change is small enough that we don’t risk stepping over any local minima. Also we use root mean square error metric to compare the best state and the target. Other error metrics can be experimented with, but for this problem, I found that RMSE was sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few days of CPU time(!), I was able to obtain something that resembled Mona Lisa after running 4 generations of life.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/lisa_cpu.webm" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>It was reassuring that my algorithm did indeed work, but I realize I made a bunch of mistakes and of course it’s not really scalable for larger images or fast.</p>



<p>Target Mona Lisa against which our random state was compared with was the medium resolution version taken from Wikipedia and converted to monochrome using PIL’s <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('L')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-38-08-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<cap><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg">Taken from wikipedia</a></cap>

<p>When you’re comparing against boolean variables, It’s better that we the target as a binary matrix rather than the whole grayscale range.</p>

<p>In this attempt, I simply rounded these grayscale values to 0s and 1s. This was a mistake as it washed away a lot of details.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-39-11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We could just not round at all and compare against the grayscale version, but there is a better way.</p>



<p>Not every random matrix of 0s and 1s are a valid Game of Life state. States that can never be an nth generation (n&gt;0) of any Cellular Automata are called Garden of Edens. It is almost impossible that our monochrome-rounded Mona Lisa is a valid Game of Life generation. We can only hope to have a solution that’s approximately close to the target.</p>

<p>This is a portion of the 4th generation of the state we just prepared.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-08-47.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Judging by the texture, the way life patterns evolve and from just experimenting with images, I found that comparing against a 1-bit dithered version the target should improve the quality of results.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-04-26.png" alt=""></p>

<cap>1-bit Dithering on Mona Lisa</cap>

<p>Dithered image has a somewhat even distribution of 0 and 1 cells which is somewhat close to what a randomly initialized Game of Life state will look like after a few generations. This property is also maintained when you scale up the image, (which we’ll optimize for soon).</p>

<p>We could do this using PIL (it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a>) using <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('1')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-54-34.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Also you can see from the last result, it’s impossible to get a continuous array of white cells because they will be killed off by the overpopulation rule. Completely dark areas are stable in life. The end result will be a higher contrast, but slightly darkened version of Mona Lisa. At higher resolutions, this effect is not as apparent.</p>



<p>The single core unvectorized version is extremely slow. I tried running this in both my 8th gen Core i7 and the Google Colab CPU machines, but you need to wait for hours/days (depending on target resolution) to get something that resembles the original.</p>

<p>Fortunately, This problem is well suited for parallelization.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/jax/master/images/jax_logo_250px.png" alt=""></p>

<p>JAX is a python library that lets you use a version of numpy and compile it to highly vectorized code that can be run on a GPU/TPU. We need to rework this algorithm for a GPU.</p>

<p>GPUs generally suited to high-throughput type computations that has good data-parallelism. We need to exploit the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture to gain faster execution speeds.</p>

<p>We extrude the <code>target</code>(Mona Lisa) and <code>canvas</code>(initial random state) to 3rd dimension with 3rd dimension being <code>batch_size</code> long tensor loafs (Consider a loaf of bread, with each slice being dithered Mona Lisa).</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-another-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-copy.png" alt=""></p>
<cap>Initial canvas will be completely random(unlike the figure).</cap>

<p>We set <code>best_canvas</code> to the initial random canvas before our hill climbing loop.</p>

<p>Also, for every loop iteration, we need to produce a random tensor called mutator(same shape as <code>target</code>) with this property: Each slice should have all zeros except a single one place at a random location.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-3rd-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>array([[[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 0],
        [0, 1],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 1],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]]])
</code></pre></div></div>

<cap><br>Example mutator with shape 5, 3, 2. batch_size being 5</cap>

<p>The idea is that in every loop, we use the mutator to calculate the nearest set of neighboring states from our best_canvas like this <code>canvas = (best_canvas + mutator)%2</code>.</p>

<p>We compute N generations of game of life across every slice of this modified canvas. Then, we do a 3D RMSE(mean being calculated for the slice only) on the Nth generation canvas against Mona Lisa, and find the slice with the lowest error.
This is slice is then extruded and set to best_canvas and the loop repeats till a finite number of iterations pass.</p>

<p>The notebook for this project is <a href="https://github.com/avinayak/mona_lisa_gol_jax/blob/main/mona_lisa_overdrive.ipynb">available in github</a>. I’ll explain what every block is doing in this section. If you want to see results, skip to the end of the article.</p>

<p>The core of this project, the game of life function is actually taken from <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">this post</a>. Thank you  Bojan Nikolic :). I followed his convention of importing <code>jax.numpy</code> as <code>N</code>, <code>jax.lax</code> as <code>L</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline 
import jax
N=jax.numpy
L=jax.lax
from jax.experimental import loops
from jax import ops
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as onp
import time
from PIL import Image 
from google.colab import files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, <code>wget</code> Mona Lisa</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!wget -O target.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/483px-Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg?download
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not a crazy high res version.It’s only 483px wide.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>batch_size = 100
image_file = Image.open("target.png")
image_file = image_file.convert('1')
lisa = N.array(image_file, dtype=N.int32)
width,height = lisa.shape
lisa_loaf = onp.repeat(lisa[onp.newaxis, :, :,], batch_size, axis = 0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This section dithers Mona Lisa using the and extrudes it to <code>batch_size</code> length.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
canvas_loaf = jax.random.randint(key, (batch_size, width, height), 0, 2, dtype= N.int32) #for tests, initialize random lisa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we’re seeding JAX PRNG(will be explained soon). Also we’re creating the initial random <code>canvas_loaf</code> with integers 0 and 1.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@jax.jit
def rgen(a):
    # This reduction over-counts the neighbours of live cells since it includes the
    # central cell itself. Subtract out the array to correct for this.

<p>This quickstart guide is inspired by <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">Ruby in Twenty Minutes</a>. It makes the assumption that you already have <a href="https://docs.toit.io/installation/toitcli/">Toit installed</a> on your machine.</p>
<p>Toit is an object-oriented programming language for the internet of things. The Toit language has the following desirable properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern, simple, and approachable</li>
<li>High-level and object-oriented</li>
<li>Declarative and statically analyzable</li>
<li>Safe and garbage collected</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get started with some programming!</p>
<h2 id="hello_world">Hello, World<a href="#hello_world" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>A local installation of Toit comes with support for running small programs directly from the command line. If you put the following code in a file called <code>hello.toit</code></p>


<p>you can run it from the command line like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<p>What just happened? The <code>toit</code> command line tool read your source code (<code>hello.toit</code>) and started running it from the <code>main</code> method that you defined. The <code>main</code> method consists of all the indented statements just below the method declaration line <code>main:</code>. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces you add to your programs are significant.</p>
<p>Once the program ran, it printed <code>Hello World!</code> in your terminal. This is because the only statement in <code>hello.toit</code> is a method call, where you invoke the <code>log</code> method with a single argument, which is the string to be logged (in this case, printed to the terminal). If you wanted to output more than one line from your program, you could update it to:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  log "Hello World!"
  log "Hello World!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>When you run the updated program, you will see two lines of output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="defining_a_method">Defining a method<a href="#defining_a_method" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if you want to say "Hello" a lot without getting your fingers all tired? You should define another method:</p>


<p>and call that from <code>main</code>:</p>


<p>Calling a method in Toit is as simple as mentioning its name. If the method doesn’t take arguments that’s all you need.</p>
<p>What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just redefine hi to take a name as an argument.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name:
  log "Hello $name!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, <code>hi</code> is a method that takes a single argument. We can use that from <code>main</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  hi "Lars"
  hi "Kasper"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and it works!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<p>What’s the <code>$name</code> bit? That’s Toit's way of inserting something into a string. It is called <em>string interpolation</em>. The bit after the <code>$</code> is turned into a string (if it isn’t one already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to make sure that someone’s name is properly trimmed so leading and trailing whitespace is ignored:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name = "World":
  log "Hello, $name.trim!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, we call the <code>trim</code> method on the <code>name</code> string before we insert it into the outer string. If we call <code>hi "   Lars  "</code> we still get the familiar greeting <code>Hello Lars!</code> and not <code>Hello   Lars  !</code>. You can add parentheses around the <code>name.trim</code> expression in the string to make it clearer which parts belong to the outer string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  log "Hello, $(name.trim)!"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe you already spotted that we went ahead and added one other trick to the code above? We added a default value for the <code>name</code> parameter, so if the name isn’t supplied when you call <code>hi</code>, we use the default name "World". Now we can try:</p>


<p>and get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="evolving_into_a_greeter">Evolving into a greeter<a href="#evolving_into_a_greeter" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and welcomes you and treats you with respect. You might want to use an object for that. Let’s create a <code>Greeter</code> class:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name := null

  constructor .name = "World":

  say_hi: log "Hi $name.trim!"

  say_bye: log "Bye $name.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>The new keyword here is <code>class</code>. This defines a new class called <code>Greeter</code> and a bunch of methods for that class. Pay special attention to the method <code>constructor</code>. There is nothing after the <code>:</code> and the <code>constructor</code> method isn’t followed by any indented lines, so the constructor has no statements in it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  constructor .name = "World":
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a constructor and it defines how you can construct objects from the class. It says the class <code>Greeter</code> takes a single argument (<code>name</code>), but the <code>.</code> prefix to the <code>.name</code> parameter actually tells us that the name is immediately stored as a field on <code>Greeter</code> objects. The field is defined just above the constructor with the <code>:=</code> syntax.</p>
<p>The field parameter <code>.name</code> still has a default value, so if we don’t pass a name, the <code>Greeter</code> will greet the world.</p>
<p>The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> methods are introduced on the next two lines. The methods both have a single statement in them, so we can keep them on one line each. The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> method both use the <code>name</code> field from the object they are called on. You can refer to fields in the class of a method simply by mentioning them (<code>name</code>).</p>
<h2 id="creating_a_greeter_object">Creating a greeter object<a href="#creating_a_greeter_object" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We create an object simply by mentioning the constructor, <code>Greeter</code>. The greeter object remembers the name and uses it for the two separate greetings. If we run this, we get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to get the name from a greeter, you can ask a greeter by calling the <code>name</code> method on it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This would show <code>How are you  Helena ?</code>. Almost neat, right? Unfortunately, the name isn’t trimmed like we expected. Let’s fix that!</p>
<h2 id="fields_and_methods">Fields and methods<a href="#fields_and_methods" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As you have just seen, a field on an object introduces a method with the same name. If you wanted to hide a field from the outside world, you could make it private. By convention, methods and fields that end with an underscore (<code>_</code>) are private and not supposed to be touched from the outside:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_:= null
  constructor .name_ = "World":
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This removes the <code>name</code> method from greeters, but if we really want to allow accessing the name from the outside, we could reintroduce a getter with the same meaning as before.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_
  say_hi: log "Hi $name_.trim!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name_.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Here we use the new keyword <code>return</code> to specify the value a method returns. We could make it slightly more interesting and trim it in the process:</p>


<p>In this way, access to the name from the outside also gets the trimming and we can avoid repeating the call to <code>trim</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_.trim
  say_hi: log "Hi $name!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We can check that it works by running:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Erik "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and you should see <code>How are you Erik?</code>. Inside <code>main</code>, we store the greeter in a local variable (<code>greeter</code>) so we can keep referring to the same object. You can think of it as a way to give a specific object a name that is only valid and useful inside the <code>main</code> method.</p>
<p>Just like introducing a member variable, we can use the <code>:=</code> syntax in methods and functions like <code>main</code> to introduce local variables.</p>
<h2 id="greetings_everyone">Greetings everyone!<a href="#greetings_everyone" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>This greeter isn’t all that interesting though, it can only deal with one person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? Let’s try to build that. We will start with a class definition:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>So MegaGreeter objects have a list of <code>names</code>. The <code>names</code> field is initialized to the empty list (<code>[]</code>). The body of the <code>MegaGreeter</code> constructor adds the given <code>name</code> argument to the end of the list of names. Notice that this is different than using a <code>.name</code> parameter that automatically assigns to the field called <code>name</code>. Mega greeters don't have a single name and no <code>name</code> field, so here the <code>name</code> is just an ordinary parameter that we can use in the body of the constructor. All in all, this code:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  log "The names are $greeter.names"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>will lead to this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
The names are ["World"]
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now go ahead and add greeter methods that show all the names:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name

  say_hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: log "Hello $it!"
  say_bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    log "Bye $everyone, come back soon."

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye

  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.names.add "Rikke"
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s dive into the new constructs in the next sections.</p>

<p>Not everything in your source files is meant to be run by the Toit compiler. Sometimes, it is nice just to add comments that explain interesting things related to your code. In the example in the last section, there were a few single line comments:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Such comments start with <code>//</code> and tell the system to ignore the rest of the line.</p>
<p>You have already seen the use of indentation to give hierarchical structure to your code. The general structure is that after a <code>:</code> you can have a single construct if it fits on one line:</p>


<p>or you can add a newline after the <code>:</code> and let the following lines that are indented relative to the outer construct …</p></article></div></div></main></div></div>

          <p><b>Wave Computing has emerged from bankruptcy proceedings with the surprise news that it’s taking the name of its MIPS subsidiary and moving to the free and open-source RISC-V ISA for future processor IP.<br>
</b></p>
<p>Wave Computing <a href="https://abopen.com/news/wave-computing-announces-mips-open-initiative/">dipped its toes in the free and open-source silicon movement back in 2018</a>, announcing that its subsidiary MIPS Tech, acquired from Imagination Technologies in June that year, would provide 32- and 64-bit versions of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA) and full licences to its MIPS-related patent portfolio free of licensing fees and royalty payments. “We invite the worldwide community to join us in this exciting journey,” MIPS IP president Art Swift said at the time, “and look forward to seeing the many MIPS-based innovations that result.”</p>
<p>In March 2019 <a href="https://abopen.com/news/wave-computing-announces-first-mips-open-release/">the first MIPS Open IP hit the market</a>, but seven months later <a href="https://abopen.com/news/wave-computing-shutters-mips-open-programme-with-immediate-effect/">the MIPS Open initiative shuttered with immediate effect</a>. The decision seemed inexplicable – until Wave Computing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April last year, unveiling financial troubles.</p>
<p>Now, that process is complete – and Wave Computing is back, but under a new name: Wave Computing is now MIPS, and is to push forward with a focus on its processor IP. That focus, interestingly, includes a move away from its in-house MIPS ISA for future designs: instead, the company’s eighth-generation cores will be based on the free and open-source RISC-V architecture with which Wave Computing’s MIPS Open had hoped to compete.</p>
<p>The reborn MIPS has not yet indicated whether it plans to release its eighth-generation IP under open terms or to keep it proprietary.</p>
