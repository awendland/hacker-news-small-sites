          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

        <p>
          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.
          </p>
          <p><cite>
            —&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">Git Internals</a>
          </cite></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Everybody claims to be a software company these days. From the nearly decade old pronouncement by Marc Andressen that <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">“Software Is Eating the World”</a> to the push from Wall Street to produce recurring software revenue; the pressure is on to claim - at least - that you are a software company. <br></p><p>This is obviously problematic for appliance vendors. Try as they might, it does not take much inspection to determine which ones have become truly software defined, and which ones are hoping to use financial engineering to fake it until they get there. <br></p><p>Either way, the ongoing debate about which is better, software defined storage or hardware storage appliances. Is pretty much over. <br></p><p>Like Marc predicted, software won. <br></p><p>We need to start with a clear definition of software defined storage. First of all, it is software. It most likely started as software too - it wasn’t “extracted” from a proprietary hardware platform. <br></p><p>Software defined storage should run on multiple customer servers with direct access storage (DAS) SSDs or disk drives or JBoDs (just a bunch of disks) or JBoF (just a bunch of flash) shelves that are SAS/NVMe attached to the servers. <br></p><p>True software defined storage doesn’t run on a narrow list of pre-approved boxes - that is just hardware defined storage with choices. Software defined storage should run on almost anything. For example a <a href="https://github.com/christianbaun/ossperf/wiki/Minio-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-3-with-Raspbian-(Debian-Jessie-8.0)">Raspberry Pi</a>. Or <a href="https://min.io/resources/docs/MinIO-POWER-whitepaper-HR.pdf">IBM Power9 infrastructure</a>. Or anything <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware">in-between</a>.<br></p><p>Hardware defined storage (appliances) combine server and storage hardware and software into one packaged solution that a customer buys whole from that vendor. Hardware defined storage is normally deployed by vendor personnel and can take the form of rackable hardware with vendor covers but underneath, is typically two or more servers with SAS or NVMe storage shelves attached. Hardware defined storage vendors provide the internal networking to connect the multiple servers and storage together. The appliance vendor personnel are responsible for servicing the appliance server and storage hardware as well as the storage software. <br></p><p>Let’s break it down further shall we?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Software Defined</th>
<th>Hardware Defined/Appliance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Superior. The customer supplies <br>their own servers &amp; storage <br>designed for the price/performance <br>configuration the deployment <br>calls for.</td>
<td>Worse. The storage vendor supplies <br>all of the hardware,<br>software and service for <br>the solution. Difficult to unbundle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Dependent on what is provisioned. <br>True high performance SDS on <br>fast HW and a fast network <br>outperforms even the “fast” <br>appliance vendors. This trend<br>will only continue. To be sure, <br>there will be niche cases <br>- but fast software is the <br>starting point.</td>
<td>Vendors optimize hardware and <br>software to get the most <br>performance and availability <br>out of the system. Price/Performance <br>curves are pretty linear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scalability</td>
<td>Better, as these are deployed <br>as a storage cluster, they <br>can often range from 3-4 nodes<br>to 100s of nodes and anything<br>in between.</td>
<td>Worse. Appliances typically come <br>with dual (server) controllers<br>and can typically scale up<br>to 4 of these (8 servers) <br>but generally not much higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fault <br>tolerance</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>treats failure as a normal event. <br>Done well, clusters seamlessly <br>redirect, heal or recover. <br>Sophisticated erasure-coding <br>and bitrot protection are software<br>inventions - and ensure manageability is <br>prioritized.</td>
<td>Appliances are generally optimized<br>for providing high levels of<br>fault tolerance. They are <br>typically deployed with dual <br>controllers that quickly failover <br>when one dies and provide <br>sophisticated storage protection <br>policies. Replacing the appliance <br>is not the same, however, as <br>replacing COTS hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automation</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API driven. These APIs typically <br>support most DevOps and <br>infrastructure automation and <br>monitoring packages currently <br>deployed in a data center.</td>
<td>Appliances generally support a <br>GUI first and APIs as second-class<br>citizens, if at all. This limits <br>automation and application failure <br>management. It is why most appliances<br>are only used for archival and not <br>modern apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration <br>flexibility</td>
<td>Customers deploy these solutions <br>on whatever performance and <br>capacity they want (within HCLs). <br>The configuration flexibility is <br>nearly infinite - critical when <br>considering the modern range <br>(data center to edge).</td>
<td>Appliances typically limit options <br>to very specific offerings, <br>generally 3-5 models are available <br>with DRAM &amp; capacity limits for <br>each model. Performance is often <br>limited by the appliance model <br>selected. Mixing and matching <br>models is a no-no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trialability</td>
<td>Want to try out software <br>defined storage - download it <br>and get started. If your <br>provider is truly open source<br>- what you are playing with <br>is the same software their <br>best customers run.</td>
<td>Appliances must be made available <br>to the customer on their data <br>center premises or at some other <br>test facility to be tried out. <br>Massive friction in the sales process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upgradeability</td>
<td>Customers can switch out <br>current servers or storage <br>with better ones anytime <br>they want and do <br>this themselves.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors generally <br>offer only specific model <br>upgrades to appliances which <br>have to be purchased and <br>are typically done by vendor <br>personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of installation</td>
<td>Better. As customers add <br>server or storage hardware <br>and deploy software on servers <br>all the time, they <br>can deploy software defined <br>storage on current or new servers <br>anytime they want.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors personnel are <br>typically used to deploy the <br>appliances. This may require <br>cross scheduling of data center <br>and vendor service personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of operations</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API first, but also supports <br>GUIs and/or are integrated <br>into larger solution interfaces <br>(think MinIO + Cisco).</td>
<td>Application vendors have invested <br>heavily in their GUI’s and <br>they are typically fully featured. <br>A good GUI can be a powerful form<br>of lock-in with IT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature <br>update frequency</td>
<td>True software defined storage <br>releases continuously. Often weekly. <br>Customers consume those on <br>demand. This means more features, <br>better security and less disruption.</td>
<td>Worse. Due to their tight <br>performance and availability <br>optimizations, testing must often <br>be more stringent and take <br>longer. This lengthens the interval <br>between feature <br>updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Footprint <br>density</td>
<td>Density traditionally favored appliances <br>- but with boxes like this, <br>that gap has been eliminated.</td>
<td>Appliances control the hardware, <br>and target the densest storage<br>shelves available - even if that<br>requires proprietary hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hardware <br>reuseability</td>
<td>Customers can take server and storage <br>hardware out of the cluster anytime <br>they wish and deploy this <br>for other uses. Licensing <br>terms may or may not need <br>to be changed. Server maintenance <br>options are at the discretion <br>of the customer and their <br>server vendor.</td>
<td>Other than using older appliances <br>as slower storage (aka boat anchors) <br>there’s not much that can be done <br>with it. However, to continue <br>to  use appliances as (slower) <br>storage , vendor maintenance contracts <br>will need to be maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Complexity</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>abstracts complexity. Great software <br>defined storage eliminates it.</td>
<td>A rare bright spot for appliance <br>vendors, the lack of flexibility <br>drives homogeneity and therefore <br>some semblance of simplicity. <br>It is why IT can be fiercely loyal<br>to their vendors.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Ultimately, there is a place for both solutions in the market today but the world is changing. <br></p><p>It burns a lot of cash to run a hardware appliance business. It ties up capital, requires large field sales and field sales support. Appliances are not built for the world we live in today. Further, as we have most famously pointed out - you <a href="https://blog.min.io/high-performance-object-storage-with-kubernetes/">can’t containerize an appliance</a>. Given that Kubernetes is the new normal - it is going to be increasingly difficult to make a living slinging steel. <br></p><p>That is why everyone is eager to say they are a “software-company” these days. Truth is, if their website is adorned with boxes showcasing their logo - it is not a software company. When they tweet a win and show some boxes, that is what they sold - not software. Just because for 45 mins every three months they say words like “revenue from software subscriptions” doesn’t mean they are a software company - it means they are on their quarterly analyst call. <br></p><p>So think about what you really want to achieve. If you want high-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage - choose software. If you want modern application support in addition to archival - choose software. If you want flexibility to design to your use case - choose software. <br></p><p>Don’t, however, choose hardware masquerading as software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Even before the pandemic, there were a few companies choosing to work shorter weeks. In Japan, Microsoft gave it a try in later part of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> and found that doing so increased productivity, reduced stress, and lessened employee burnout. It also had the added benefit of lowering operating costs for that month.</p><p>With COVID-19, average work environments have become even more stressful. Places like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/24/will-coronavirus-pandemic-open-door-four-day-workweek/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a> are acknowledging that there is no "one size fits all" solution to helping companies recover or thrive through the global pandemic.</p><p>What would happen if your company decided to run fewer days per week? Would you discover the same benefits as other companies? To answer this question for yourself, you will have to test the theory in your own company. However, to help you, we have looked to find out how other companies are dealing with COVID-19 and what they have gained from switching to a <a href="https://30hourjobs.com/4-day-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-day work week</a>.</p><h2 id="buffer">Buffer</h2><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/4-day-workweek-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a> became a company that chose to experiment for a single month. Their goal was to reduce the stress that employees and teammates were dealing with because of the global crisis. In June, the company decided to continue their May experiment to last the rest of 2020.</p><p>Why the change from "experiment" to full-time? The answer to this is in the feedback provided by their teammates. It seems unanimous that everyone experienced lower stress levels, increased work happiness, and less burnout. Employees worked more efficiently and effectively in their four days because of how relaxed they felt.</p><p>Although it is only something they are trying for the rest of the year, there is hope that it will continue to prove such an undeniable success.</p><h2 id="elephant-ventures">Elephant Ventures</h2><p><a href="https://www.elephantventures.com/4-day-work-week-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephant Ventures</a> has been doing 4-day work weeks in the Philippines for the past five years. They have noticed that across the board there is an increase in productivity because workers feel it balances out the work-life scenarios that we all have to face in the workforce.</p><p>In early June, the company closed its doors on their brick and mortar offices in the US. At the time, there was reasonable certainty that the doors would remain closed. However, in August, they decided that this was not what they truly wanted and began trying to come up with a way to meet the needs of clients in the "post Covid-19" world and take tips from their Philippines offices.</p><p>It is a little too soon to tell whether it is an absolute success or not. This does not mean that there isn't a hope that clients and employees will all be happy working this shorter workweek.</p><h2 id="shopify">Shopify</h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/remote-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify's</a> employees have embraced the remote/in-office way of working for years. However, in March 2020, they closed the door and went fully remote in an effort to "flatten the curve". The fact that they are working in a digital space by default, has made the transition much easier for them than traditional brick and mortar businesses. They already understand that eliminating bad work habits and strengthening healthier ones is beneficial to everyone.</p><p>In June, Shopify once again changed things up and announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/postcarl/status/1272676581165727746" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> that they would reserve Friday as the day for R&amp;R. Their goal at the time was to enjoy the shorter work week through August. It remains to be seen whether it is extended or not.</p><h2 id="shake-shack">Shake Shack</h2><p>For more than a year, Shake Shack has been <a href="https://www.wabe.org/enjoy-the-extra-day-off-more-bosses-give-4-day-workweek-a-try/" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing</a> the theory of shorter work weeks makes for happier employees. It began with a test run in Las Vegas to give managers an extra day off from work each week, while providing them with the typical 40-hour work week benefits. This means the same pay for fewer hours. With the success of it, the gradually spread out the "testing phase" to include more locations.</p><p>Their findings over the last year, is that employees, especially moms, appreciate working a shorter week because it gives them an extra day to spend with their families. This makes them feel better about being at work, because they do not miss out on taking kids to school, running errands on their day off, and more.</p><p>As the pandemic took hold of the US and all other areas of the globe, <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shake Shack</a> did what it could to care for its employees. They still strive to do what they can for the communities that they are a part of.</p><h2 id="radioactive-public-relations">Radioactive Public Relations</h2><p>In June 2019, <a href="https://www.radioactivepr.com/agency-impact-1-year-4-day-pay-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radioactive Public Relations</a> reached their one-year benchmark for working shorter work weeks. They were one of the first companies in the UK to give shorter weeks a try and quickly decided to extend their "test" phase.</p><p>Why was the test phase extended? The answer to this is simple. Employees were taking fewer sick days, recruitment was on the rise, business was growing, and employees were happier across the board. The employee happiness reasoning has ranged from enjoying the time with their families to doing things that they wouldn't be able to do if they worked a traditional work week.</p><h2 id="perpetual-guardian">Perpetual Guardian</h2><p>This New Zealand-based company was one of the first to jump on board with shorter work weeks. Andrew Barnes, founder of <a href="https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/the-four-day-week-is-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perpetual Guardian</a>, began testing the water with it in 2018. Since then, they have discovered that it encourages employees to work harder while encouraging staff members to organize their time more efficiently while at work.</p><p>Overall, it has lowered the stress level of all who work within the company by allowing them to have more of a life outside the office. Employees can now use their time to take up hobbies, spend time with loved ones, return to school for extra studies, and much more.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about balancing your work/life schedule or want to know more about transitioning to a shorter work week, we are here for you. You can contact us, join our newsletter, and more. Our goal at <a href="https://jobs.30hourjobs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 Hour Jobs</a> is to ensure everyone works the way they want to work.</p>

          <h2>Eliminating Task Processing Outages by Replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka Without Downtime</h2>

          <p><span>Scaling backend infrastructure to handle hyper-growth is one of the many exciting challenges of working at DoorDash. In mid 2019, we faced significant scaling challenges and frequent outages involving </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery_(software)"><span>Celery</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"><span>RabbitMQ</span></a><span>, two technologies powering the system that handles the asynchronous work enabling critical functionalities of our platform, including order checkout and Dasher assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We quickly solved this problem with a simple, </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"><span>Apache Kafka</span></a><span>-based asynchronous task processing system that stopped our outages while we continued to iterate on a robust solution. Our initial version implemented the smallest set of features needed to accommodate a large portion of existing Celery tasks. Once in production, we continued to add support for more Celery features while addressing novel problems that arose when using Kafka. </span></p>
<h2><span>The problems we faced using Celery and RabbitMQ</span></h2>
<p><span>RabbitMQ and Celery were mission critical pieces of our infrastructure that powered over 900 different asynchronous tasks at DoorDash, including order checkout, merchant order transmission, and Dasher location processing. The problem DoorDash faced was that RabbitMQ was frequently going down due to excessive load. If task processing went down, DoorDash effectively went down and orders could not be completed, resulting in revenue loss for our merchants and Dashers, and a poor experience for our consumers. We faced issues on the following fronts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability:</b><span> Outages caused by demand reduced availability.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b><span> RabbitMQ could not scale with the growth of our business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Observability:</b><span> RabbitMQ offered limited metrics and Celery workers were opaque.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Operational efficiency:</b><span> Restarting these components was a time-consuming, manual process.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Why our asynchronous task processing system wasn’t highly available</span></h3>
<p><span>This biggest problem we faced were outages, and they often came when demand was at its peak. RabbitMQ would go down due to load, </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#high-connection-churn"><span>excessive connection churn</span></a><span>, and other reasons. Orders would be halted, and we’d have to restart our system or sometimes even bring up an entirely new broker and manually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"><span>failover</span></a><span> in order to recover from the outage.</span></p>
<p><span>On diving deeper into the availability issues, we found the following sub-issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Celery allows users to schedule tasks in the future with a countdown or ETA. Our heavy use of&nbsp; these countdowns resulted in noticeable load increases on the broker. Some of our outages were directly related to an increase in tasks with countdowns. We ultimately decided to restrict the use of countdowns in favor of another system we had in place for scheduling work in the future.</span></li>
<li><span>Sudden bursts of traffic would leave RabbitMQ in a degraded state where task consumption was significantly lower than expected. In our experience, this could only be resolved with a RabbitMQ bounce. RabbitMQ has a concept of Flow Control where it will reduce the speed of connections which are publishing too quickly so that queues can keep up. Flow Control was often, but not always, involved in these availability degradations. When Flow Control kicks in, the publishers effectively see it as network latency. Network latency reduces our response times; if latency increases during peak traffic, significant slowdowns can result that cascade as requests pile up upstream.</span></li>
<li><span>Our python </span><a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span>uWSGI</span></a><span> web workers had a feature called harakiri that was enabled to kill any processes that exceeded a timeout. During outages or slowdowns, harakiri resulted in a connection churn to the RabbitMQ brokers as processes were repeatedly killed and restarted. With thousands of web workers running at any given time, any slowness that triggered harakiri would in turn contribute even more to slowness by adding extra load to RabbitMQ.</span></li>
<li><span>In production we experienced several cases where task processing in the Celery consumers&nbsp; stopped, even in the absence of significant load. Our investigation efforts did not yield evidence of any resource constraints that would’ve halted processing, and the workers resumed processing once they were bounced. This problem was never root caused, though we suspect an issue in the Celery workers themselves and not RabbitMQ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, all of these availability issues were unacceptable for us as high reliability is one of our highest priorities. Since these outages were costing us a lot in terms of missed orders and credibility we needed a solution that would address these problems as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why our legacy solution did not scale&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The next biggest problem was scale. DoorDash is growing fast and we were quickly reaching the limits of our existing solution. We needed to find something that would keep up with our continued growth since our legacy solution had the following problems:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Hitting the vertical scaling limit</strong></p>
<p><span>We were using the largest available single-node RabbitMQ solution that was available to us. There was no path to scale vertically any further and we were already starting to push that node to its limits.</span></p>
<p><strong>The High Availability mode limited our capacity&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Due to replication, the primary-secondary High Availability (HA) mode reduced throughput compared to the single node option, leaving us with even less headroom than just the single node solution. We could not afford to trade throughput for availability.</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the primary-secondary HA mode did not, in practice, reduce the severity of our outages. Failovers took more than 20&nbsp; minutes&nbsp; to complete and would often get stuck requiring manual intervention. Messages were often lost in the process as well.</span></p>
<p><span>We were quickly running out of headroom as DoorDash continued to grow and push our task processing to its limits. We needed a solution that could scale horizontally as our processing needs grew.</span></p>
<h3><span>How Celery and RabbitMQ offered limited observability</span></h3>
<p><span>Knowing what’s going on in any system is fundamental to ensuring its availability, scalability, and operational integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we navigated the issues outlined above, we noticed that :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We were limited to a small set of RabbitMQ metrics available to us.</span></li>
<li><span>We had limited visibility into the Celery workers themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We needed to be able to see real-time metrics of every aspect of our system which meant the observability limitations needed to be addressed as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The operational efficiency challenges</span></h3>
<p><span>We also faced several issues with operating RabbitMQ:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We often had to failover our RabbitMQ node to a new one to resolve the persistent degradation we observed. This operation was manual and time consuming for the engineers involved and often had to be done late at night, outside of peak times.</span></li>
<li><span>There were no in-house Celery or RabbitMQ experts at DoorDash who we could lean on to help devise a scaling strategy for this technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Engineering time spent operating and maintaining RabbitMQ was not sustainable. We needed something that better met our current and future needs.</span></p>
<h2><span>Potential solutions to our problems with Celery and RabbitMQ&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>With the problems outlined above, we considered the following solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Celery broker from RabbitMQ to Redis or Kafka. </b>This would allow us to continue using Celery, with a different and potentially more reliable backing datastore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Add multi-broker support to our </b><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a><b> app so consumers could publish to N different brokers based on whatever logic we wanted. </b>Task processing will get sharded across multiple brokers, so each broker will experience a fraction of the initial load.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade to newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ. </b>Newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ were expected to fix reliability issues, buying us time as we were already extracting components from our Django monolith in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Migrate to a custom solution backed by Kafka. </b>This solution takes more effort than the other options we listed, but also has more potential to solve every problem we were having with the legacy solution.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered: “What if clicking on a hyperlink could transport me — not just the screen in front of me — to a new location?”</p><p>That’s what the founders of Uber wondered. So, they transformed an ordinary link into a request for a ride.</p><p>This is called “hacking hypertext”.</p><p>Imagine, a link—a button, a menu, a search result—being able to accomplish something in the real world with a single click.</p><p>Google is a great example of this. They hacked hypertext in two ways: 1) They realized a hyperlink to a page meant that page is more valuable and 2) They gave everyone access to the most valuable links with the click of a Search button.</p><p>Facebook took hyperlinks to the next level by making them represent people and their relationships. Events, messages, profile pages, relationship statuses — all available with a click.</p><p>Who else has hacked hypertext?</p><ul><li>Amazon has 1-Click ordering that makes products show up at your door</li><li>Airbnb lets you rent apartments around the world with a click</li><li>Netflix makes thousands of tv shows and movies accessible with a single click</li></ul><p>These companies transform the good ol’ hyperlink into something incredibly powerful. </p><p>For most of us, though, links are still just plain, boring links.</p><p>As an ordinary person on the internet, I can’t create a link out of thin air that will show a list of my upcoming events or let someone rent my apartment — I rely on Facebook and Airbnb to create these kinds of links. </p><p>So, the question is: <em>why isn’t hypertext more powerful by default?</em></p><p>The answer is: it’s wildly expensive to transform an ordinary hyperlink into something more.</p><p>Big companies like Google and Facebook spend billions of dollars a year building the infrastructure and hiring the talent necessary to support their hypertext hacks.</p><p>Usually, the most an ordinary citizen of the internet can do is use a hyperlink to link to their social media profile or personal website.</p><p>But... what if someone decided to democratize the incredible power these big companies have to hack hypertext?</p><p>What if anyone could hack hypertext?</p><p>More and more companies are buying into the “Low-Code” movement. Companies like Stripe, Webflow, and Shopify are making it easier to create online businesses. And companies like Airtable, Bubble, and Glide are making it possible for ordinary people to build powerful experiences using a set of hypertext hacks they invented.</p><p>But the foundation is still lacking. Hypertext itself hasn’t changed that much in the past three decades. It’s still, by default, pretty weak. It’s meant to create links between pages, not links to real-world actions.</p><p>I believe there’s a stage after “Low-Code”, a kind of hypertext 2.0. Maybe it comes with virtual reality, or cryptocurrency — or maybe it’s born when someone creates a new type of web browser. I don’t know. But, when it comes, it’s going to let anyone have the power to reshape the real world with a good ol’ hyperlink.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>How does QuestDB get the kind of performance it does, and how are we continuing
to squeeze another 50-60% out of it? We are constantly learning more about the
fundamental concepts of memory performance, and this is one example of how what
we at first thought would be <em>worse</em> for performance ended up bringing us a
rather substantial boost in overall memory performance.</p><p>We will walk you through how some of our initial thoughts on storage and
memory-mapping evolved to bring us better performance overall.</p><p>If you like QuestDB, please do give us a star on
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p><h2>How the performance improvements started</h2><p>QuestDB started out with a single-threaded approach to queries and such. But one
obvious way to improve performance in a Java application like this is to
parallelize as much as you can by using multiple threads of execution.</p><p>I've written multi-threaded applications, and they are not easy to do. It's hard
to coordinate the work between multiple threads, and to make sure that there are
no race conditions, collisions, etc.</p><h2>Storage performance</h2><p>So first it's important to understand that QuestDB stores it's data in columnar
format. We store each column of data in a file. So for every column of data,
there is a file.</p><p>We then split those columns up into data frames that are independent and can be
computed completely independently of each other.</p><p>The problem we encountered with this framing scheme was that it was impossible
to frame variable length data. Data spilled out of the frame, making it
difficult to manage.</p><p>You see, we store fixed length fields with fixed length values, such that
aligning frames to 8 bytes would ensure that all our fixed length data does not
straddle frames. Hence all the columns are the same frame width. But strings and
blobs can't be forced into 8 bytes without making them useless.</p><p>So we could extract extreme performance out of all the fixed-length values, but
these variable-length values dragged the performance back down.</p><p>Which brings us to pages and how data is referenced in memory.</p><h2>Pages of data</h2><p>QuestDB uses memory-mapped pages to reference data in order to make it really
fast. If you're dividing up your data into pages, and all data has a fixed
length, then it's relatively easy to ensure that you don't have data that spans
multiple pages. You just break pages at multiples of 8-bytes and everything will
fit within page boundaries.</p><p>When you add variable-length data, suddenly you cannot ensure that everything
will line up along page boundaries and you will have the very real possibility
-- actually a certainty -- that you may have to jump from one page to another
just to get all the data contained in a frame.</p><p>This, it turns out, is hugely inefficient. If (data is in frame) then (process
that data) else (figure out where the rest of the data is, get that, then
process it all). This kind of if-then-else sprinkled throughout the code is a)
hard to debug and b) leads to lots of branching, which slows down execution.</p><p>In order to prevent variable length data from straddling frames we would need to
have different frame lengths per column. Furthermore, calculating aligned frame
lengths for variable length data is non trivial and requires scanning the entire
data set which would reversing any performance gains from parallelization.</p><h2>One page to rule them all</h2><p>(Yes, I just made a <em>The Highlander</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference</a>)</p><p>What if, in order to get around data being on multiple pages, we simply used
<em>one</em> page for all of the data? Of course my first question was "Don't you at
some point reach a limit on the page size?" but Vlad and Patrick assured me
there is, indeed, no limit on a page size.</p><p>If your page size is bigger than the available memory, the kernel will handle
swapping pages in and out for you as you try to access different parts of the
page. So of course I asked "well then, why didn't you do this from the
beginning?"</p><p>Vlad, in his typically self-deprecating style, just said "We didn't know. We
thought we should keep them to a certain size to keep them from growing out of
control" which, quite frankly, seems like the right answer.</p><p>We'd just resize those smaller pages as needed. But as Vlad explained, if you do
that then you need to copy the data over to the new, resized page and "copying
can take over your life." Databases aren't built to maximize the efficiency of
data copying. They are built to maximize the ability to extract value from data.
Copying data from one page to another isn't extracting value.</p><p>So they tried just allocating a new page, and jumping from one page to the next
as needed to find the required data. This cut down on the copying of data, but
it lead to the problems outlined in the previous section. You never knew which
page your data was going to be on, and jumping from one page to another was
hugely inefficient.</p><p>So they tried having just the one page. One massive page (that you can grow as
needed, without copying data around). Vlad, again in his style, said the
performance turned out to be "not bad" with this approach. And by "not bad" he
of course meant about a 60% performance improvement.</p><p>When you get into using one single page, of course the total available address
space comes into play. But since QuestDB only runs on 64-bit architectures, we
have 2^64 address space, which is more than enough.</p><p>This is where Patrick jumped in to explain that when you have an area of memory
mapped from a file, when the file grows you remap the new size into memory. The
operating system does not need to copy anything; the virtual memory model allows
the OS to just remap the already mapped pages into the newly mapped memory
region. In many cases, the OS may have already reserved the entire address space
for you so your new mapping is in the same region as the old, just bigger.</p><h2>Kernels are smart</h2><p>The kernel allocated a full sized address space for your file when you requested
the memory-mapped file. And apparently this is true across Linux, macOS and
Windows. So from that point on, there's really no further copying that needs to
happen.</p><p>Furthermore, the kernel is going to handle paging parts of that file in and out
of memory as needed. Now, I'm old-school Unix, and page-swapping which lead to
thrashing was always something we worried about back in the olden days. So I
asked about it. According to Patrick, this could only happen really if you have
a massive file that you are reading basically randomly at high speed. Other than
that, the kernel will handle reading ahead and pre-loading pages as needed in
order to be as efficient as possible.</p><p>Kernels, it turns out, are smart. In fact, kernels are basically smarter than
you or I will ever hope to be. They've been developed across decades to be
hugely efficient at doing these things. It's what they do. The kernel will
memory map the file into the file cache and even if it needs to move stuff
around, it can move the logical address and it's still the same underlying
physical memory pages.</p><p>If you think that you can take over caching the data from the OS and do a better
job of managing the memory space, and the allocation and re-allocation of the
memory, you're wrong. Again, this is what the Kernel does, and at some level,
even if you try to take this job away from the kernel, it is <em>still</em> doing some
amount of it anyway. So your attempts to take this memory management and
allocation away from the kernel has done little more than just add another layer
on top of what the kernel is doing anyway. Another layer on top of something is
basically never more efficient than the original thing.</p><p>When you read an offset into a file, you send a buffer to read into, the address
to start reading at, and the offset into the file. Now, the kernel is going to
cache all of that for you as you do it, because that's the kernel's job, really.
But many database developers then take that, and cache it themselves, with their
own caching scheme.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>When I asked Vlad about this, and how it relates to query speed, he was quite
explicit in saying that thinking you (a database developer) can beat the kernel
is pure folly. Postgres tries this and, according to Vlad, an aggregation over a
large (really large!) dataset can take 5 <em>minutes</em>, whereas the same aggregation
on QuestDB takes only 60ms. Those aren't typos.</p><p>To both Patrick and Vlad (and me, for what that's worth), the idea that we, as
developers, can be better at these operations than the kernel (when really we're
doing them <em>on top of</em> the kernel anyway) is simply ridiculous. If I take an
army of researchers and spend a decade of development, then <em>maybe</em> I can do it
better than the kernel, but during that time guess what? The army of people
working on the kernel will have found further improvements and left me behind
anyway.</p><p>It comes down to letting the kernel do its job, and us doing ours. And our job
is to exploit the kernel for every ounce of performance we can get out of it
without trying to do it's job for it.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>When it comes to performance claims, we always try to back them up with actual
numbers that can be replicated. You can run these tests yourself, and you can
always go and look at the
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>

September 4, 2020 | https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>
  Theoretically, staging environments sound nice. Why wouldn’t you want
  something that previews what the code will look like before production? The
  issue is what happens in practice.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a big ask. To show how much of a big ask it is let’s walk through an
  example. Say that there’s a developer named Bob. Bob works in a 7 person
  startup that is building a SaaS tool. Their stack has three parts: a static
  HTML frontend, a node backend, and a Postgres server.
</p>
<p>
  This week, one of Bob’s goals is to set up a staging environment to get those
  sweet sweet previews everyone’s been talking about. It looks simple enough,
  they’re already using serverless to deploy their frontend so the job is
  reduced down to hooking up some pipeline to deploy a version of the frontend
  for each new commit on a separate subdomain.
</p>
<h4>Issue 1: Version Incompatibilities With The Backend</h4>
<p>
  That works and he’s happy. Two weeks later though, there are some issues. The
  team is working on a major feature that’s been in development for the past few
  days on a separate branch. It includes both changes to the frontend and a new
  endpoint on the backend. So the staging environment crashes because it tries
  to talk to the backend while the backend doesn’t have the endpoint. The
  solution? Give the staging environment its backend. Bob wrangles the pipeline
  a bit to deploy a backend and a frontend for each change. After a few days of
  work, it’s done and he’s happy.
</p>
<h4>Issue 2: Handing Database Schema Changes</h4>
<p>
  Three weeks later, there's an issue again. Now the team is working on a
  feature that includes a schema change on the database. They can’t use the
  staging environment because the server crashes due to incompatibility with the
  database. The solution seems clear. Bring the database into the staging
  environment. He wrangles the pipeline to spin up a new DB for each commit and
  run migration scripts on startup every time. Now the staging environment is a
  complete miniature copy of what’s happening in production. There shouldn’t be
  any more issues going forward. Right?
</p>
<h4>Issue 3: Maintaining The Codebase For Different Target Environments</h4>
<p>
  Wrong. Bob notices something unexpected. The team is using staging
  environments less than before. Turns out it's a hassle to have to create a new
  user account and generate content every time they want to test things on the
  staging environment. They started seeding the staging database on startup, but
  then realized they now have to maintain code to seed the database for each
  table inside it, and that’s a hassle.
</p>
<p>
  <b>As the staging environment grew more complicated, it became less easy to
    work with.</b>
  In the future, the backend might need another service to function like a Redis
  instance or a new microservice. That’s gonna have to go into the staging
  environment too. Maybe Bob should have stopped at just the frontend and kept
  the staging environment hooked up to the production backend.
</p>
<p>
  But then the team risks incompatibility issues when the staging frontend
  expects a different version of the production backend it’s talking to. At
  best, the frontend will throw errors occasionally, at
  <b> worst it will silently leave corrupted data on the database</b>.
</p>
<h4>Staging Isn't Easy</h4>
<p>
  If your team doesn't have the bandwidth or the resources to build a pipeline
  that can spin up entire miniature copies of the production environment,
  <b>staging isn't for you</b>. The biggest draw for staging environments is to
  visually inspect changes to the frontend. The backend parts of the codebase
  can often be more conveniently verified through testing.
</p>
<p>
  For previewing frontends, we built Capsule for developers like Bob’s team. You
  can use the extension to make HTML recordings of the frontend. Just by linking
  to your capsule in the PRs, you'd be able to do the same thing a staging
  environment can do with none of the work of maintaining a staging environment
  pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Say that I was part of the google calendar team, and wanted to share my local
  changes. I click on the extension, and boom:
</p>

<p>
  I have a shareable link to my changes. No maintance; no deployment pipelines
  needed.
</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

<h3>Learn how to implement an automated machine learning strategy with the goal of finding the optimal stocks for algorithmic trading.</h3>



<hr>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/0*Qin1Uu6TF6EGY9Qe" alt="Image for post" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@stephenleo1982?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Leonardi</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p id="761b">With the increasing popularity of machine learning, many traders are looking for ways in which they can “teach” a computer to trade for them. This process is called algorithmic trading (sometimes called algo-trading).</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Algorithmic trading is a hands off strategy for buying and selling stocks that leverages technical indicators instead of human intuition.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p id="8e73">In order to implement an algorithmic trading strategy though, you have to first narrow down a list of stocks that you want to analyze. This walk-through provides an automated process (using python and logistic regression) for determining the best stocks to algo-trade.</p>



<p id="45b0">I will dive deeper into the logic and code below, but here is a high-level overview of the process:</p>



<ol><li>Import the historical data of every stock using yahoo finance.</li><li>Pull in over 32 technical indicators for each stock using the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</li><li>Perform a logistic regression on each stock using 5, 30, and 60 day observation time periods.</li><li>Interpret the results.</li></ol>



<hr>



<h2 id="7355">Import Necessary Libraries</h2>



<p id="9268">Running this program in python requires these libraries:</p>

<h2 id="8a50">Collecting Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="b37a">Obtaining historical data on the stocks that we want to observe is a two-step process.</p>



<ol><li>Narrow down a list of stocks that we want to observe.</li><li>Make individual calls to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>&nbsp;in order to import data about each company.</li></ol>



<p id="d925"><strong>Choosing the Stocks We Want to Target</strong></p>



<p id="b1b8">The library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>&nbsp;allows us to compile a list of stock tickers by filtering companies on aspects like market cap or exchange. For this example, I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions).</p>



<p id="b0b7">You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. This is very important. You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<p id="a75a">We also need to remove and create a folder on our local machine to hold historical stock data. Note that before this step runs for the first time, you will need to manually create this folder. This step is important because it will get rid of the data from past iterations and allow the program to start new.</p>



<div><pre data-file="https://gist.github.com/cameronShadmehry/7fd146a70470186482eadefde6dec7ea#file-atlr_gettickers-py" data-lang="Python"><code># List of the stocks we are interested in analyzing. At the time of writing this, it narrows the list of stocks down to 44.
# If you have a list of your own you would like to use just create a new list instead of using this, for example: tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", ...] 
tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)

# Check that the amount of tickers isn't more than 2000
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))

# These two lines remove the Stocks folder and then recreate it in order to remove old stocks. Make sure you have created a Stocks Folder the first time you run this.

os.mkdir("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Bayesian_Logistic_Regression\\Stocks\\")</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="c45e">Importing Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="1c9d">We will now obtain the historical price data of each stock in our tickers list by making independent calls to Yahoo Finance. After receiving the data, the program will save each company’s information in a new CSV file that will be located in the folder you created beforehand.</p>

Amount_of_API_Calls = 0

# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2
# seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again.
# Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP. The clause "(Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800)" below will stop the loop from making
# too many calls to the yfinance API.

<h2 id="2687">Importing Technical Indicators</h2>



<p id="a921">In order to run a logistic regression on each stock, we need to substantiate the independent variables. These 32+ technical indicators will act as predictor variables for the dependent variable.</p>



<p id="6e7c">To bring in the technical indicators we make use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</p>



<p id="1d04">You will also notice that we are creating three extra columns. These will act as the value we are trying to predict (dependent variable) with the model. The three variables are 5, 30, and 60 day observations of the closing prices of each stock (1 if it increased and 0 if it did not).</p>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

<p>This summer, I am again <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/11/research-assistant.html">working on Rust full-time</a>, and again I will work (amongst other things) on a “memory model” for Rust/MIR.
However, before I can talk about the ideas I have for this year, I have to finally take the time and dispel the myth that “pointers are simple: they are just integers”.
Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.</p>

<p>I also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what <em>is</em> the data that is stored in memory?
It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte?
Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)</p>

<h2 id="pointers-are-complicated">Pointers Are Complicated</h2>

<p>What is the problem with “pointers are just integers”?  Let us consider the following example:<br>
(I am using C++ code here mostly because writing unsafe code is easier in C++ than in Rust, and unsafe code is where these problems really show up. C has all the same issues, as does unsafe Rust.)</p>

    <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It would be beneficial to be able to optimize the final read of <code>y[0]</code> to just return <code>42</code>.
The justification for this optimization is that writing to <code>x_ptr</code>, which points into <code>x</code>, cannot change <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>However, given how low-level a language C++ is, we can actually break this assumption by setting <code>i</code> to <code>y-x</code>.
Since <code>&amp;x[i]</code> is the same as <code>x+i</code>, this means we are actually writing <code>23</code> to <code>&amp;y[0]</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, that does not stop C++ compilers from doing these optimizations.
To allow this, the standard declares our code to have <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/14/undefined-behavior.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, it is not allowed to perform pointer arithmetic (like <code>&amp;x[i]</code> does) that goes <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">beyond either end of the array it started in</a>.
Our program violates this rule: <code>x[i]</code> is outside of <code>x</code>, so this is undefined behavior.
To be clear: Just the <em>computation</em> of <code>x_ptr</code> is already UB, we don’t even get to the part where we want to <em>use</em> this pointer!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But we are not done yet: This rule has a special exception that we can exploit to our advantage.
If the arithmetic ends up computing a pointer <em>just past</em> the end of an allocation, that computation is fine.
(This exception is necessary to permit computing <code>vec.end()</code> for the usual kind of C++98 iterator loop.)</p>

<p>So let us change this example a bit:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>+</span><span>8</span><span>;</span> <span>// one past the end</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>==</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
      <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, imagine that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have been allocated <em>right next to each other</em>, with <code>y</code> having the higher address.
Then <code>x_ptr</code> actually points <em>right at the beginning</em> of <code>y</code>!
The conditional is true and the write happens.
Still, there is no UB due to out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>This seems to break the optimization.
However, the C++ standard has another trick up its sleeve to help compiler writers: It doesn’t actually allow us to <em>use</em> our <code>x_ptr</code> above.
According to what the standard says about <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">addition on pointers</a>, <code>x_ptr</code> points “one past the last element of the array object”.
It does <em>not</em> point at an actual element of another object <em>even if they have the same address</em>. (At least, that is the common interpretation of the standard based on which <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/vxmtej">LLVM optimizes this code</a>.)</p>

<p>The key point here is that just because <code>x_ptr</code> and <code>&amp;y[0]</code> point to the same <em>address</em>, that does not make them <em>the same pointer</em>, i.e., they cannot be used interchangeably:
<code>&amp;y[0]</code> points to the first element of <code>y</code>; <code>x_ptr</code> points past the end of <code>x</code>.
If we replace <code>*x_ptr = 23</code> by <code>*&amp;y[0] = 0</code>, we change the meaning of the program, even though the two pointers have been tested for equality.</p>

<p>This is worth repeating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal and can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this sounds subtle, it is.
In fact, this still causes miscompilations in both <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35229">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65752">GCC</a>.</p>

<p>Also notice that this one-past-the-end rule is not the only part of C/C++ where this effect can be witnessed.
Another example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict"><code>restrict</code></a> keyword in C, which can be used to express that pointers do not alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Calling <code>test()</code> triggers UB because the two accesses in <code>foo</code> must not alias.
Replacing <code>*y</code> by <code>*x</code> in <code>foo</code> changes the meaning of the program such that it no longer has UB.
So, again, even though <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the same address, they cannot be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Pointers are definitely not integers.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-pointer-model">A Simple Pointer Model</h2>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> a pointer?
I don’t know the full answer to this.
In fact, this is an open area of research.</p>

<p>One important point to stress here is that we are just looking for an <em>abstract model</em> of the pointer.
Of course, on the actual machine, pointers are integers.
But the actual machine also does not do the kind of optimizations that modern C++ compilers do, so it can get away with that.
If we wrote the above programs in assembly, there would be no UB, and no optimizations.
C++ and Rust employ a more “high-level” view of memory and pointers, restricting the programmer for the benefit of optimizations.
When formally describing what the programmer may and may not do in these languages, as we have seen, the model of pointers as integers falls apart, so we have to look for something else.
This is another example of using a “virtual machine” that’s different from the real machine for specification purposes, which is an idea <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html">I have blogged about before</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple proposal (in fact, this is the model of pointers used in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00703441/document">CompCert</a> and my <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/08/rustbelt.html">RustBelt work</a>, and it is also how <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">miri</a> implements <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fefe81605d6111faa8dbb3635ab2c51d59de740a/src/librustc/mir/interpret/mod.rs#L121-L124">pointers</a>):
A pointer is a pair of some kind of ID uniquely identifying the <em>allocation</em>, and an <em>offset</em> into the allocation.
If we defined this in Rust, we might write</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>alloc_id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>isize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding/subtracting an integer to/from a pointer just acts on the offset, and can thus never leave the allocation.
Subtracting a pointer from another is only allowed when both point to the same allocation (matching <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#6">C++</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It turns out (and miri shows) that this model can get us very far.
We always remember which allocation a pointer points to, so we can differentiate a pointer “one past the end” of one allocation from a pointer to the beginning of another allocation.
That’s how miri can detect that our second example (with <code>&amp;x[8]</code>) is UB.</p>

<h2 id="the-model-falls-apart">The Model Falls Apart</h2>

<p>In this model, pointers are not integers, but they are at least simple.
However, this simple model starts to fall apart once you consider pointer-integer casts.
In miri, casting a pointer to an integer does not actually do anything, we now just have an integer variable (i.e., its <em>type</em> says it is an integer) whose <em>value</em> is a pointer (i.e., an allocation-offset pair).
However, multiplying that “integer” by 2 leads to an error, because it is entirely unclear what it means to multiply such an abstract pointer by 2.</p>

<p>I should clarify that this is <em>not</em> a good solution when defining language semantics.
It works fine for an interpreter though.
It is the most lazy thing to do, and we do it because it is not clear what else to do (other than not supporting these casts at all – but this way, miri can run more programs):
In our abstract machine, there just is no single coherent “address space” that all allocations live in, that we could use to map every pointer to a distinct integer.
Every allocation is just identified by an (unobservable) ID.
We could now start to enrich this model with extra data like a base address for each allocation, and somehow use that when casting an integer back to a pointer… but that’s where it gets really complicated, and anyway discussing such a model is not the point of this post.
The point it to discuss the <em>need</em> for such a model.
If you are interested, I suggest you read <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Estevez/papers/KHM+15.pdf">this paper</a> that explores the above idea of adding a base address.</p>

<p>Long story short, pointer-integer casts are messy and hard to define formally when also considering optimizations like we discussed above.
There is a conflict between the high-level view that is required to enable optimizations, and the low-level view that is required to explain casting a pointer to an integer and back.
We mostly just ignore the problem in miri and opportunistically do as much as we can, given the simple model we are working with.
A full definition of a language like C++ or Rust of course cannot take this shortcut, it has to explain what really happens here.
To my knowledge, no satisfying solution exists, but academic research is <a href="http://sf.snu.ac.kr/publications/llvmtwin.pdf">getting closer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This was by no means meant to be an exhaustive list of academic research on C in general. I do not know of other work that focuses directly on the interplay of integer-pointer casts and optimizations, but other noteworthy work on formalizing C includes <a href="https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics">KCC</a>, <a href="https://robbertkrebbers.nl/thesis.html">Robbert Krebber’s PhD thesis</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">Cerberus</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<p>This is why pointers are not simple, either.</p>

<h2 id="from-pointers-to-bytes">From Pointers to Bytes</h2>

<p>I hope I made a convincing argument that integers are not the only data one has to consider when formally specifying low-level languages such as C++ or (the unsafe parts of) Rust.
However, this means that a simple operation like loading a byte from memory cannot just return a <code>u8</code>.
Imagine we <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/rlibc/blob/defb486e765846417a8e73329e8c5196f1dca49a/src/lib.rs#L39">implement <code>memcpy</code></a> by loading (in turn) every byte of the source into some local variable <code>v</code>, and then storing it to the target.
What if that byte is part of a pointer?  When a pointer is a pair of allocation and offset, what is its first byte?
We have to …</p></article></div>

                    <p>WireGuard is pretty great!</p><p>You might have noticed the buzz around <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> lately.
WireGuard is a very simple VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, and the buzz comes from both the fact that it’s simple and good at what it does, and the fact that it’s so good that it’s going to be included in the Linux kernel by default.
Linus Torvalds himself said that <a href="http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2018/08/02/124">he loves it</a>, which took the software world by storm, as we weren’t aware that Linus was capable of love or any emotion other than perkele.</p>
<p>The only problem I’ve found with WireGuard is a lack of documentation, or rather a lack of documentation where you expect it.
The <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">quickstart</a> guide, the first thing I look at, mentions a configuration file that it never tells you how to write, and it also assumes you’re more familiar with networking than I am.</p>
<p>Since the initial conditions at the creation of the universe set things up so WireGuard would eventually be underdocumented, I am going against Creation itself and showing you how to easily configure and run it.
Let’s <!-- break -->begin!</p>
<h2>Short overview</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/guard-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>A guard that looks kinda wiry, and makes sure you don't subconsciously find this post dry and boring.</span></p></div><p>At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another.
It doesn’t really let you access other computers on either end of the network, or forward all your traffic through the VPN server, or anything like that.
It just connects two computers, directly, quickly and securely.</p>
<p>To do anything other than that, you’ll need to configure your network for it, which is “out of scope” for the WireGuard docs, but which I consider very much in the scope of a VPN.
Luckily, WireGuard comes with a helper script, <code>wg-quick</code>, which will do pretty much everything the average user needs.
Keep in mind that the configuration files for <code>wg-quick</code> aren’t compatible with the <code>wg</code> executable, but <code>wg-quick</code> is all we’ll need, so that shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Let’s start setting everything up.</p>
<h2>Installation and setup</h2>
<p>To install WireGuard, see <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">the installation</a> page, it should be a pretty simple process.
After you’ve installed it, you will need to generate a private and a public key for each computer you want accessing the VPN.
Due to WireGuard’s design, both computers on either end of a connection will need to have each other’s public key.</p>
<p>Let’s generate these keys. On each of the computers that will be in the VPN, create the directory <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and run these commands <em>on each of the computers</em> in the directory you just created:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ <span>umask</span> <span>077</span>  <span># This makes sure credentials don't leak in a race condition.</span>
$ wg genkey <span>|</span> tee privatekey <span>|</span> wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</pre></div>
<p>This will generate two files, <code>privatekey</code> and <code>publickey</code> on each of the computers.
The <code>publickey</code> file is for telling the world, the <code>privatekey</code> file is secret and should stay on the computer it was generated on.
You need to paste the contents of these files in the config file, I’m afraid WireGuard doesn’t support referencing them by path yet.</p>
<p>If your VPN server is behind a NAT, you’ll also need to open a UDP port of your choosing (<code>51820</code> by default).
Do this for any computer you want to connect <em>to</em> (computers that you’ll connect <em>from</em> don’t need a port open, as far as I know, but correct me if I’m wrong).</p>
<h2>Common scenarios</h2>
<p>After you’ve done the above, you’re ready to configure WireGuard.
Go to <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and create a file called <code>wg0.conf</code> on each of your computers.
We’ll go over some common scenarions along with the configuration for each.</p>
<h3>Just a single connection</h3>
<p>If you just want a single connection between two computers (say, to connect your laptop to your home server), the configuration is pretty simple.
On the server, enter the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.1</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>51820</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2/32</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That’s all you need for the server.
Keep in mind that <code>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</code> is your home server’s <code>privatekey</code> file’s contents (<strong>not</strong> the path to the file, the actual <strong>contents</strong>, a long line of gibberish), and <code>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</code> is similarly the contents of your laptop’s <code>publickey</code> file.</p>
<p>For the client, here’s the configuration:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24</span>

<span># This is for if you're behind a NAT and</span>
<span># want the connection to be kept alive.</span>
<span>PersistentKeepalive</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, replace the keys with the appropriate strings you generated.</p>
<p>As you can see, the addresses I picked for each computer are <code>192.168.2.1</code> and <code>192.168.2.2</code>, because that subnet was free in my setup.
If there’s an interface with that subnet on either computer, you should pick another one, such as <code>192.168.3.x</code>, to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>After writing the two files, run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> on the server and then on the client.
The two machines should now be connected if you entered the server’s IP in the config and configured the port correctly, and you should be able to <code>ping 192.168.2.1</code> from the VPN client and see the responses.
To close the connection again, just run <code>wg-quick down wg0</code>.</p>
<p>I repeat that <em>this setup only lets you access the server’s interface from the client</em>, it won’t forward any of your traffic over the server or let you access any other machines on the server’s LAN.</p>
<h3>Accessing your home LAN</h3>
<p>To actually access the server’s LAN, you’ll need to make a slight modification to the configuration.
On the server’s config file, at the end of the the <code>[Interface]</code> section, add these two lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PostUp</span>   <span>=</span> <span>iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
<span>PostDown</span> <span>=</span> <span>iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that your LAN interface is called <code>eth0</code>.
If it isn’t, change the lines above to the actual name.</p>
<p>On the client, add your LAN’s subnet under <code>AllowedIPs</code>.
For example, if your subnet is <code>192.168.1.x</code>, change <code>AllowedIPs</code> to look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Briefly, the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting acts as <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing">a routing table when sending, and an ACL when receiving</a>.
When a peer tries to send a packet to an IP, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code>, and if the IP appears in the list, it will send it through the WireGuard interface.
When it receives a packet over the interface, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code> again, and if the packet’s source address is not in the list, it will be dropped.</p>
<p>You might need to enable IP forwarding on the server for this to work, but it’s a simple process for Linux. <a href="http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/">Here’s a good guide</a>. If you’re running an OS X or Windows server, you don’t deserve nice things.</p>
<p>Then run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> as above, and you should be able to ping the other computers in the LAN from the client, as if you were home.
Try <code>ping 192.168.1.1</code> or any other computer in your LAN to verify.</p>
<p>Do note that <em>this won’t forward any other traffic</em> through your server, so it won’t proxy your web browsing or anything like that.
It will just let you talk to other machines on your server’s LAN.</p>
<p>For traffic forwarding, see below:</p>
<h3>Forwarding all your traffic through</h3>
<p>If you want to forward <em>all</em> your traffic through the VPN, WireGuard can easily do that as well.
Keep in mind that, if you’re doing this to avoid ISP tracking, it won’t work against your server’s ISP.
All your traffic will just look like it’s coming from your server, but if that’s at your house, all your torrents and porn downloading is just going to look like it’s coming from there, even though you’re at a net cafe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>To forward all the traffic through, simply change the <code>AllowedIPs</code> line on the client to this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here’s the entire client config again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will make the <code>wg0</code> interface responsible for routing all IP addresses (hence the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>), and should route all your traffic over your server.
You can check by loading one of the <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">what is my IP</a> websites and seeing that your server’s IP is what’s detected.</p>
<h2>Securing and running on startup</h2>
<p>After you’re done, run the following to make the directory and files readable only by administrators (it <em>does</em> contain secret keys, after all):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo chown -R root:root /etc/wireguard/

<p>After you’ve created and secured the file, you can easily set WireGuard to initialize the VPN on startup if your OS is using <code>systemd</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl <span>enable</span> wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to start or stop the service:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>

<p>I hope this has been useful!
It’s the guide I wish existed before I spent three hours trying to configure WireGuard, and hopefully you can just copy the configs and have it work right away.</p>
<p>If you need the configuration for IPv6, I’m afraid you’re going to have to experiment yourself, as my ISP does not support it, but feel free to let me know what should be added and I can amend the article.</p>

<p>
I'm taking a break from debugging books to talk about a calamitous shitshow of textbook writing: <i>Mastering C Pointers: Tools for Programming Power</i>, by Robert J. Traister.
</p>

<p>
I learned of the book through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SUkrR7ZfTA">talk</a> by Brian Kernighan where he refers to the book as probably “the worst C programming textbook ever written.”<span>[<a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a>]</span>
He doesn't name it but <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1003411102791692288">with some help</a> I was able to track down his obliquely accurate reference.
</p>

<p>
This book has become my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20whale">white whale</a>.
Since I started reading debugging books, and especially now that I'm digging through older ones, I find bits of advice that simply don't work today.
While some of it could be construed as useless or idiotic, I've always found the authors come from a position of earnestness, attempting to draw the best conclusions based on decent principles and what they knew at the time they wrote it.
In some cases they may not have known much, but they're honestly and humbly trying to impart some wisdom.
</p>

<p>
When Kernighan put up the following example, I saw what seemed to be the opposite of that.
</p>

<pre>char *combine(s, t)
char *s, *t;
{

      int x, y;
      char r[100];

      strcpy(r, s);
      y = strlen(r);
      for (x = y; *t != '\0'; ++x)
           r[x] = *t++;

      r[x] = '\0';

      return(r);

}
</pre>

<p>
This program (formatting preserved) is taken from the first edition of the book (p.146).
It's horrific (Kernighan calls it “malpractice”).
It does not exhibit the genuineness I have seen with, say, books from the late 1970s on how to debug BASIC programs.
I didn't know what it was.
Deceit?
Laziness?
Unremitting ignorance?
What is the mindset of someone who writes this, presumably thinking it's a good idea?
Can the whole book be that bad?
Kernighan said it was.
I had to know.
</p>

<p>
The book has two editions: the first was published in 1990, the second in 1993.
The fact that there are two editions piqued my curiosity even more.
It sold enough to make another version?
Is that horrible example corrected?
I obtained a copy of each and read them.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the book is pointless.
Kernighan was right: it's garbage.
And the second edition only makes things worse.
Teaching from either one would be a breach of ethics.
If you follow Traister’s coding practices, even adjusted for today's standards, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to create defects and vicious, latent bugs.
A subtly pernicious aspect of the book is the casual tone of the writing.
It’s informal enough that if you don’t really know much about C what he says sort of makes sense, despite the sloppy terminology and mixed, inaccurate metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Any trained programmer will recognize the lessons as worthless.
His terminology is all over the map and typically inaccurate, if not plainly wrong.
Expressions “return a value.”
Values are “handed” into locations.
Constants are “written directly into the program.”
A union is a “specialized pointer.”
The terminology isn’t even consistent.
Micro-optimizations are stressed at all times, and program efficiency is valued over comprehension.
He can’t even define a pointer correctly: “A pointer is a special variable that returns the address of a memory location.”
It does not take long to realize Traister has no idea what he’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Although I’m not going to go over the content (that would take far too long since there’s nothing redeeming there), I did take extensive notes.
You can <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/notes.html">read them</a>, if you are so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I must, however, take a moment to single out the code.
It is universally bad and much of it is simply wrong.
(Imagine trying to learn programming principles from a book that contains a large number of programs that don’t even compile.)
I’ve <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/code.html">transcribed</a> some of the programs and annotated them with comments so that you can get a taste of how inept Traister is as a C programmer.
One thing to keep in mind (both for the programs and the notes) is that C89/C90 was new at the time and that the code was written on (and for) MS-DOS systems of the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Things were a bit different then.
</p>

<p>
Enough about the material.
I want to explore the question of how something so wrong even got written.  It’s not that everything in the book is wrong, but it feels like when it’s right, it’s right by accident.
</p>

<p>
Traister has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-J.-Traister/e/B001H6UPHY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1529540256&amp;sr=1-1">written</a> other books, some about electronics and some about programming, one called <i>Going from BASIC to C</i>.
In <i>Mastering C Pointers</i>, he talks about a product he created called CBREEZE that converts BASIC code to C.
Throughout the book he makes passing, roundabout references to BASIC and uses terminology that suggests he’s written a lot of BASIC code.
For example, there is a whole chapter on using pointers to access memory, where reading and writing memory is instead called “peeking” and “poking”, based on the PEEK and POKE instructions in BASIC.
He also says that it took him a couple of tries to learn C coming from BASIC.
In short, I’m convinced he’s knowledgeable about BASIC and has worked on writing software for small, electronic devices.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important?
As I read the book (and if you read my notes, you know where this is going) I started to notice something in the wording and tone.
The further I progressed the more I became convinced of it, and I think it explains how he managed to mangle the explanation of C pointers so badly.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think he understands the call stack.
</p>

<p>
My argument for this interpretation requires a little knowledge of BASIC and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
With BASIC, the key thing to know about most implementations at the time is that there were no functions and no scope aside from the global scope.<span>[<a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a>]</span>
The closest thing to a function in BASIC is the GOSUB command.
The GOSUB command jumps to a line and executes code until it gets to a RETURN statement, where control is transferred back to the line following the GOSUB command.
Within a GOSUB you can jump somewhere else with another GOSUB.
The control follows a stack principle, but no arguments are passed.
GOSUB routines are a way to factor out common code, but that common code has to work on global variables.
(And yes, it’s as terrible as it sounds.)
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the case of simple electronic devices.
Even today some embedded devices, usually programmed using C, do not have a call stack that dynamically allocates space for automatic variables.
There simply isn’t enough memory for it.
Instead, the compiler lays out memory such that each function’s local variables have fixed memory addresses (a “compiled stack” model).
The only stack you have is for return addresses and it is probably handled in hardware.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you’re used to writing BASIC for small memory electronic devices and you learn about C.
You read about pointers and realize something: it’s possible to write a subroutine that can change variables <i>without knowing their names</i>.
It’s manna from heaven!
You don’t have to devote global variables to being the “parameters” of your subroutines anymore.
Life is great.
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset I think Traister had and never got past.
In the book there is one fleeting mention of the stack in reference to excessive (automatic) memory allocation.
(On MS-DOS, if the space for local variables is too large in the program, it might not compile.)
He consistently describes variables as having “exclusive” addresses in the program.
His writing about pointers suggests that he thinks, for each function, space is set aside to hold the local variables for the duration of the program, but you can only access them when inside the function in which they were declared.
So pointers are really powerful because you can provide this address to another function and it can change the value using only a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence for his lack of understanding is that he frequently cites ridiculous space micro-optimizations within functions, such as avoiding the use of integers for index variables, if possible.
Another one, mentioned often, is local <code>char</code> arrays that have a fixed size.
There are good reasons to not use them but his are not among them.
His admonishment is that they waste space.
Technically, that is true, but they don't exist until they're on the stack.
And he never talks about global or file variables.
He only refers to locals with “exclusive” addresses “set aside” for variables.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation runs into some problems once you start asking how functions with malloc will work, but it's worth pointing out that there is almost no discussion about memory management.
In a book devoted to C pointers, that's a toxic mix of gross negligence and incompetence.
There is literally one short paragraph devoted to talking about the <code>free</code> function—and it's characterized as a “side note.”
</p>

<p>
Another sticking point in this interpretation is Traister’s incomprehensible approach to writing functions that take a variable number of arguments.
He does this by passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function (the first being the number of arguments) and accessing them using offsets from the address of the first argument.
This suggests he has some idea about parameters being passed in a dynamic fashion, but it is so spectacularly wrong<span>[<a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a>]</span> you’re left wondering if he even tried his programs out before publishing them.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, this is the most generous interpretation of the text I could come up with, and it still paints a terrible picture.
Occam's Razor suggests that Traister is just clueless.
But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01l1WIC9mBo">analyzing a terrible movie</a> that somehow gets made, it's more fun to reason through the “behind the scenes” parts.
</p>

<p>
Given the ineptness of the book, you'd think it was self-published.
You would be wrong.
It was published through Academic Press, which was a division of Harcourt, Brace &amp; World at the time, but is now an “imprint of Elsevier.”
</p>

<p>
In the preface of the second edition it says that the first edition was reviewed “by a professional C programmer hired by the publisher.”
That programmer said it should not be published.
That programmer was right, but the publisher went ahead and …</p></div></div>

This proxy battle over social status pitted "techlash" cheerleaders against those of us who understand that neither ROI nor innovation grows on trees.

First of all, how is "👏👏👏" your standard for jokes, yikes. Secondly, @VCBrags' gimmick would be considered textbook harassment if aimed at less fashionable targets.</p><p>That's the term for habitually taunting users who have blocked you, right? Are we changing the rules now and it's hunky-dory to repeatedly tweet imputed insults at women (and men) who clearly don't want to chat? Wait, I thought tech was supposed to be woke 🤔</p><p><em>I </em>didn't establish these standards as mainstream, but I sure do notice when they're violated. And frankly @VCBrags' sense of humor was cruel. Here's the most recent tweet that I consider beyond-the-pale rude, honestly just plain mean:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-7.26.42-PM.png 1168w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>She wears sunscreen and takes calls with aspiring entrepreneurs, <em><a href="https://twitter.com/VCBrags/status/1296193655615651853">quelle horreur</a></em>!

"The intention was never to punch down," hmm?</figcaption></figure><p>That post isn't out of character, nor is it a new development. The point of @VCBrags has <em>always</em> been to shit on people for celebrating, or even simply expressing enthusiasm. I don't blame Hunter Walk for being unaware, since I doubt that he's read through the backlog, but @VCBrags <em>never</em> bothered to selectively skewer the inordinately pompous.

You can't even appreciate animal onesies?</figcaption></figure><p>The reason to write about this Twitter drama is pretty simple: Culture matters. As I've pointed out before, that's why <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/multiplayer-psychosis/">everyone gets so worked up</a>. It would be ludicrous to claim that conceptions of <em>coolness</em> don't have real-world effects; I can attest that my own street cred has been hugely advantageous, and I am by no means a big deal.</p><p>If we want to <a href="https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/">build the awesome future directly</a>, we need to point out who is a pernicious influence, who focuses on tearing others down rather than building them up — <em>especially</em> if they amass clout by doing so, then use it to initiate a negativity flywheel. Personally I can excuse moderate and occasional bitchiness (including from myself), but not the devoted focus of @VCBrags.</p><p>And yes, there should be reputational consequences for this behavior. Nobody needs to be fired, I'm not advocating for that, but bad-faith critics of the tech industry and those who work in it should be identified and ignored. After all, we genuinely do want to grow and improve! Meekly accepting malice, versus insisting on constructive feedback, undermines that effort.</p><p>So let's talk about Pasquale, this story's <em>enfant terrible</em>. It may be a tad confusing if you didn't see the saga unfold on Twitter — I won't recap every detail, but you can get up to speed here:</p><figure><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/09/01/the-enduring-mystery-around-an-anonymous-twitter-account-that-infuriated-techs-kingpins-and-nearly-ruined-a-founders-reputation/#4879f4d8548d"><div><p>The Enduring Mystery Around An Anonymous Twitter Account That Infuriated Tech’s Kingpins—And Nearly Ruined A Founder’s Reputation</p><p>By lampooning venture capitalists, @VCBrags accumulated an audience that included billionaires Jack Dorsey and Mark Cuban—and enmity from many of the people it skewered.</p><p><img src="https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png"><span>Abram Brown</span><span>Forbes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat(jpg)/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f4dbdc61f01affb0ae14e3e%2F0x0.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>That post is <em>mostly</em> accurate.

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>

<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>

<p>This summer I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 at PostgreSQL Global Development Group. During these 3 months, I was working on performance and safety features for <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g">WAL-G</a> utility. I went through this summer journey together with my mentors <a href="https://github.com/g0djan">Georgy Rylov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/x4m">Andrey Borodin</a>. In this post, I will mainly focus on the work done during the program.</p>



<p>WAL-G is a tool written in Go for backing up and restoring PostgreSQL clusters (most recently MySQL, MongoDB, and FoundationDB too). It supports Amazon S3 storages (and S3 compatible analogs, like Yandex Object Storage), as well as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Swift Object Storage, and the file system.</p>



<p>In its core functionality, WAL-G is a successor of WAL-E but written in Go. WAL-G works much faster than WAL-E and also has some new cool features, one of them is delta-backups. Delta-backup, whenever possible, stores only pages, changed since the previous backup. When a full recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last base backup plus all of the delta<em> </em>backups until the point of restoration.</p>



<p>The goal of the project was to make two enhancements:</p>



<p>The first one was to improve the performance of the backup fetch process by implementing delta-backups unpacking in reverse order to avoid rewriting the same pages along with the following backup structure reorganization to avoid downloading unnecessary files.</p>



<p>The second was to provide users with the features to verify backup consistency, such as WAL’s history consistency check and page checksum verification.</p>



<p>These two enhancements were implemented as four features:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#unpackreverse">Unpack delta-backups in reverse order</a></li><li><a href="#reorganizebackup">Reorganize backup structure to avoid downloading unnecessary files</a></li><li><a href="#walhistorycheck">WAL’s history consistency check</a></li><li><a href="#checksumverification">Page checksum verification</a></li></ul>



<p>All of the four features by now are merged into WAL-G master branch. You can try them by cloning the<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g"> WAL-G repo</a>.</p>



<h2 id="unpackreverse">Unpacking delta backups in reverse order</h2>



<p>When restoring from delta backup, WAL-G at first unpacks the oldest version of the page files from base backup and then applies delta backups to the base version in historical order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CSh90AC62ojlPE7uCv0Ms2xl-buHF--mp3qZ8mb6bCGeK3V7D-S_92aaOTHFBI0h6NuAZ6fCci8DdV__6_kwh2sfVrYGsYSE1FAdWhCiHO-HxV9rygxaJXR112AuT9ERexCQkMYt" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G default backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that there are page blocks in the older backup which are going to be completely overwritten by their version from the newer backup, thus resulting in unnecessary writes to disk. The main goal of this feature was to improve backup fetch performance by implementing an unpack of delta backups in reverse order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEyTQyTvj1VzFKlSO4Jd2FQW_xofm2TBKxnHXSyY7AN94SDPFDppYL6E7J4F7QFspmLTqoFIrSVJlGIdPT99aNOV0ABgiRoNPjAmH7upqLWHy6xE5JHB3KDnDjkbEeppyAXFRzvF" alt=""><figcaption>Reverse backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this approach, pages are written to the disk only once, which noticeably improves backup restore performance. The main idea was to create page files from the latest delta backup at first, then fill the missing information from the following delta backups and the base backup.</p>



<p>The following text describes how WAL-G creates the page file without unnecessary page overwrites. It will focus on the most non-trivial case when the page file was modified multiple times since the first appearance in the base backup. Other more trivial cases are omitted for briefness. The page file is restored using the following scheme:</p>



<ol><li>Create page file from delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the previous delta</li><li>…</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the first delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the base backup</li></ol>



<h4>Create page file from delta</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G3T7fENlEHMmJUn327j1rAPyO_dzHDMYj8b7UCi5fVuTs1r_BCiO2lADT4feALN5NHdeD28F5XBVFdi5_2GQwrPqS5IRw4jpzA-T5V6EBYUwoXGwqxi0NwJDl5Y1OjQLc_RBBRmd" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G increment file header</figcaption></figure>



<p>WAL-G uses the information from the header of the delta page file to extract the final size of the page file. Knowing the final size of the page file and the PostgreSQL page size, it is possible to calculate the page count needed to write on the disk. For each page WAL-G performs the following algorithm to write the pagefile:</p>



<ol><li>If this page exists in delta backup, write it to the page file</li><li>If this page does not exist in the delta, write an empty page block to the page file</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ov865hrbNync4w4GYeICfb4qU2q4elCY5xetoJ2fglJgSjORdAPW_ywlJmHJE2t3LXjhxFheOkZ-BKnBWkQGs8YcoogD9E-dR8aZS55TyIJq-4O9DBkW9RjTvq9VSRzwfwYi25ij" alt="" width="372" height="249"><figcaption>Structure of the created page file</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the N-th delta to the page file</h4>



<p>For each next delta, WAL-G needs to write only the missing information to the page files. For each page in N-th delta backup WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the page from delta</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qraIB_-HykTegsB2Hkuhf1GsyCcL_p8PWXYwQKzKeWC1zAQBaXA0jxa6t2WcKBycDR3zG51BZhdMBftYucTB0XB3QfXnCL9JT36FlrW9uUvV-a1zv7D6ujxt0NFKGwNvwOpdwoQq" alt=""><figcaption>Application of N-th delta to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the base backup to the page file</h4>



<p>After WAL-G reached the base backup, it needs to get the missing pages from the base backup page file version. For each page in the local page file WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the base backup page</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9lBoXoMFN54cDWH9GCyXVgz4k_VxHYG6xAhmude06gNmTrVF7tLHzIHOgXwNIXSJ3jgwuXjM8P4FjK9JraZSjOtdLC4J2U1Nkf_P7nvuU-dJJN35FsZqAITcr9NrTxBDTICWh7t_" alt=""><figcaption>Application of base backup to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve implemented the proposed approach and measured performance improvement. WAL-G with reverse delta unpack turned on demonstrated about 2.5x faster backup restore compared to the standard WAL-G. If you are interested in more details, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/benchmarks/reverse-delta-unpack-26-03-2020.md">complete benchmark report</a>.</p>

<ul><li>set the&nbsp;<code>WALG_USE_REVERSE_UNPACK</code> environment variable</li><li>add the <code>--reverse-unpack</code> flag:</li></ul>



<pre><code>wal-g backup-fetch /path LATEST --reverse-unpack</code></pre>

<h2 id="reorganizebackup">Reorganization of backup structure</h2>



<p>After the implementation of the reverse delta unpack feature disk load and overall performance during backup-fetch<strong> </strong>has been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, WAL-G still needed to download absolutely all backup files from the cloud. However, with the reverse delta unpack feature implemented it wasn’t longer necessary – for example, there may have been a situation when WAL-G already had a consistent local version (no missing page blocks) of each file in the archive that was going to be downloaded. In this case, the archive contained only outdated files that aren’t useful anyway, so WAL-G can skip the download of the entire archive and proceed to the next one. The goal was to avoid downloading these unnecessary archives from the cloud and improve the WAL-G backup fetch performance even more 🙂</p>



<p>WAL-G stores each backup in the cloud split into several compressed archives. The problem is that to check which files exist in the archive you need to download and decompress it from the storage. The main idea is quite simple – store the contents of each archive in a backup JSON sentinel file so WAL-G can skip the archives without interesting files without downloading them.</p>



<pre><code>{ // this is a sample backup sentinel JSON file 
  "PgVersion": 120002,
  "UncompressedSize": 500781396,
  "CompressedSize": 100243768,
  "LSN": 17448304680,
  "DeltaCount": 8,
  "DeltaFromLSN": 16743661608,
  "SystemIdentifier": 6847498813832237599,
  "DeltaFullName": "base_00000003000000030000002F",
  "TarFileSets": { // new field to store information of contents of each tar archive here
    "part_001.tar.lz4": [
      "/",
      "/base",
      "/base/1",
      "/base/13689",
      "/base/13690",
      "/base/16384",
      "/base/16384/1259",
      "/base/16384/16397",
...
    ],
    "part_003.tar.lz4": [
      "tablespace_map",
      "backup_label"
    ]
  },
  "Files": {...},
  "DeltaFrom": "base_0000000300000003000000E6_D_0000000300000003000000D6",
  "FinishLSN": 17448304952,
  "Spec": null
}</code></pre>



<p>We’ve successfully implemented this approach and now WAL-G stores the contents of each backup archive in backup sentinel JSON by default. However, with this approach, the case when all of the files in the archive can be skipped may be quite rare. For a file that is being updated frequently, there is a high chance that some delta backup will contain only outdated information about it that WAL-G won’t need. And vice versa, if some file is being updated rarely, there is a high chance that delta backup will still hold some required data so we can’t skip the archive containing this file and we need to download the entire archive.</p>



<p>That’s why we developed an additional backup creation mode (<code><code>rating composer</code></code>) based on file update ratings. The idea was to place the files with a similar update frequency in the same archives so we can get the higher chance of the entire archive to be skipped. WAL-G needed to somehow determine the update frequency for each file in the database cluster folder. Luckily, for paged files, there is information from Postgres statistics collector – particularly <code>n_tup_ins</code>, <code>n_tup_del</code>, <code>n_tup_upd</code> columns from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> view.</p>







<p>In the rating composer mode, during backup creation, for each file WAL-G calculates the updates count using the data from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> and stores it in the current backup sentinel JSON. If available, WAL-G also reads the <code>previousUpdatesCount</code> – previous updates count value from the previous backup sentinel JSON. Using these values WAL-G then calculates the <code>updateRating</code> for each file: <code>(currentUpdatesCount * 100) / previousUpdatesCount</code>. Finally, all that left to do is:</p>



<ol><li>Sort all the files in the current backup by their <code>updateRating</code></li><li>Start packing files into archive from the file with the highest update rating</li><li>When the size of the files packed in the current archive exceeds the <code>WALG_TAR_SIZE_THRESHOLD</code> limit, create the new archive, and go to step 2.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, seems like we’re done… But actually no. To speed up things a little bit, WAL-G can do concurrent packing of multiple tar archives during backup creation (<code>WALG_UPLOAD_DISK_CONCURRENCY</code> setting). If you look closely, the above algorithm can’t be parallelized in straightforward …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The complexity of cloud costs keeps increasing - When we were building PlanForCloud in 2012 AWS had just hit 10,000 different pricing points for their services - now there are over 300,000.</p>
<p>We found existing tools fit in too late in the process and are not aimed at the people in control of the infrastructure. It’s difficult to get cost estimations when you are building and deploying your services, which often leads to bill shock and no easy way to track down these costs. So we wanted to build a CLI tool that can plug into your existing development and operations processes and bring cost visibility to the engineers.</p>
<p>Currently Infracost supports AWS and Terraform, but we will add support for more cloud vendors (GCP, Azure) and other IaC tools (Pulumi).</p>
<p>We also want to go beyond just the baseline costs of infrastructure - data transfer costs and other usage-based costs can often be a significant portion of a cloud bill, and are also the hardest to predict and track down. If you have any ideas about the best way to handle these then please <a href="https://twitter.com/aliscott" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reach out to me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Infracost is open source, you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/aliscott/infracost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/aliscott/infracost</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

<div>
<p><img src="https://fastpages.fast.ai/images/copied_from_nb/fastcore_imgs/td.png" alt="screenshot with code"></p>
<p>I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn't seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find!  That's when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests?  I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what I did over the past month!  I'm pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I've ever experienced.  I've discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also <em>why the code works the way it does</em>, and to explore edge cases while writing tests.  Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible!  It turns out the library I choose, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is a library on top of which many <a href="https://github.com/fastai">fast.ai</a> projects are built on. Most importantly, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I'm going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:</strong>  I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages.</li>
<li><strong>You get a new set of pragmatic tools</strong>: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.</li>
<li><strong>Learn more about the Python programming language:</strong>  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Making-**kwargs-transparent">Making **kwargs transparent<a href="#Making-**kwargs-transparent"> </a></h2><p>Whenever I see a function that has the argument <strong>**kwargs</strong>, I cringe a little.  This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that <code>foo</code> also accepts and additional parameters <code>b</code> and <code>d</code>.  We can fix this with <code>delegates</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can customize the behavior of this decorator.  For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping <code>**kwargs</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude arguments.  For example, we exclude argument <code>d</code> from delegation:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also delegate between classes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes">Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes<a href="#Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes"> </a></h2><p>Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in <code>__init__</code>?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Ouch! That was painful.  Look at all the repeated variable names.  Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class?  Not Anymore!  Checkout <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">store_attr</a>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude certain attributes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>There are many more ways of customizing and using <code>store_attr</code> than I highlighted here.  Check out <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">the docs</a> for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate">Avoiding subclassing boilerplate<a href="#Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate"> </a></h2><p>One thing I hate about python is the <code>__super__().__init__()</code> boilerplate associated with subclassing.  For example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#PrePostInitMeta">PrePostInitMeta</a>.  We define a new class called <code>NewParent</code> that is a wrapper around the <code>ParentClass</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Type-Dispatch">Type Dispatch<a href="#Type-Dispatch"> </a></h2><p>Type dispatch, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">Multiple dispatch</a>, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives.  This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia.  For example, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">conceptual example</a> of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting spaceship</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting spaceship</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box.  Fortunately, there is the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html#typedispatch-Decorator">@typedispatch</a> decorator to the rescue.  This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function <code>f</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html">you can read about here</a>. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch">multipledispatch</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin">Mathhew Rocklin</a> (the creator of Dask).</p>
<p>After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p><code>functools.partial</code> is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= <code>val</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can create a new function out of this function using <code>partial</code> that sets the default value to 5:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One problem with <code>partial</code> is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Composition-of-functions">Composition of functions<a href="#Composition-of-functions"> </a></h2><p>A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result.  This is especially useful when applying various data transformations.  Consider a toy example where I have three functions:  (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>But why is this useful?  You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>arrsum</span><span>(</span><span>add2</span><span>(</span><span>filter5</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>])))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You are not wrong!  However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>For more information about <code>compose</code>, read <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#compose">the docs</a>.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="A-more-useful-__repr__">A more useful <code>__repr__</code><a href="#A-more-useful-__repr__"> </a></h2><p>In python, <code>__repr__</code> helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging.  Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using <code>store_attr</code>, which was discussed earlier).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can use <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#basic_repr">basic_repr</a> to quickly give us a more sensible default:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator">Monkey Patching With A Decorator<a href="#Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator"> </a></h2><p>It can be convenient to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/">monkey patch</a> with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing.  We can use the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#patch">decorator @patch</a> from <code>fastcore.foundation</code> along with type hints like so:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now, <code>MyClass</code> has an additional method named <code>func</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Still not convinced?  I'll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="A-better-pathlib.Path">A better pathlib.Path<a href="#A-better-pathlib.Path"> </a></h2><p>When you see <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">these extensions</a> to pathlib.path you won't ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Path.readlines</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.readlines()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.read</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.read()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.save</code>: saves file as pickle</li>
<li><code>Path.load</code>: loads pickle file</li>
<li><code>Path.ls</code>: shows the contents of the path as a list. </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">Read more about this here</a>.  Here is a demonstration of <code>ls</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Wait!  What's going on here?  We just imported <code>pathlib.Path</code> - why are we getting this new functionality?  Thats because we imported the <code>fastcore.foundation</code> module, which patches this module via the <code>@patch</code> decorator discussed earlier.  Just to drive the point home on why the <code>@patch</code> decorator is useful, I'll go ahead and add another method to <code>Path</code> right now:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>That is magical, right?  I know!  That's why I'm writing about it!</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>

<h2 id="An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas">An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas<a href="#An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas"> </a></h2><p><code>Self</code>, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object.  For example, let's create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can use <code>Self</code> in the same way:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Let's create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The above QR code contains a complete Windows executable that will run on Windows 7 and up. It's a simple but fully playable implementation of Snake.</p>
<p>A QR code is a data storage medium like any other, and while it's almost always used to store ASCII text, it can also be used to store binary data. As such, virtually any computer data can theoretically be stored in a QR code provided it can fit within the size limitations.</p>
<p>A QR code comes in various standard sizes, the largest being version 40 which can store up to 2,953 bytes (roughly 2.9 KB) of binary data. The above code is not quite that large, it's only storing around 1.4 KB of data (shrunk down from 3.2 KB with <a href="http://www.crinkler.net/" target="_blank">Crinkler</a>, slightly larger than the executable shown in the video because I decided to add a little more functionality).</p>

<p><b>Method 1: Webcam (automatic)</b></p>
<p>You can treat this QR code much like a QR code in the real world by using your computer's webcam to read it (e.g. after loading this page on a phone or printing the QR code out). For this, I recommend using zbarcam. I've included a download link with everything you need:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open "Read Snake From QR.bat". After a moment, your webcam will activate.</li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and Snake will appear, freshly read from the QR code.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Method 2: Webcam (manual)</b></p>
<p>This method is the same as the above, however if you'd rather input the commands manually than running my script, go for it:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
    <li><span>cd</span> to the zbarcam folder.</li>
    <li>Run the following command:
        <p>zbarcam --raw --oneshot -Sbinary &gt; snake.exe</p>
        <p>The arguments used are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>--raw</span> - Disables any character encoding conversion.</li>
            <li><span>--oneshot</span> - Stops reading and closes zbarcam after the code has been successfully read.</li>
            <li><span>-Sbinary</span> - Informs zbarcam that the data in the code is binary data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and an executable called "snake.exe" will appear in the same folder.</li>
    <li>Open "snake.exe".</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been patched to correctly output binary data on Windows. This project exposed a bug in zbarcam where binary data was incorrectly treated as text, inadvertently corrupting it as Windows attempted to convert LF line endings to CRLF. The fix used here has since been merged into zbar's master source code, but as of July 2020 no stable release version has included the fix yet.</li>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been compiled with DirectShow support for greater compatibility with webcam devices. In my video, I use a build that has not been compiled for DirectShow (using VfW instead) which leads to a black and white webcam feed. This build provides a feed in color.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote an implementation of Snake in JavaScript that, when minified, could also fit into the maximum QR code size which I briefly showcased in the video. Some people were interested in playing this, so <a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/snake-minified.html">it is available here</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm stepping down from Rust's core team. It's my last official involvement with Rust, and I'm kinda sad about leaving. Rust is exciting and important, and I love the community and technology. It has been a joy and an education to work with the core team; they are good people.</p><p>I stopped working full-time on Rust early in 2019 when I left Mozilla. I have been contributing as part of my work at PingCAP (big thank you for that support!) and in my own time, but have had much less time for the work than it deserves. My wife and I are expecting a second daughter any day now, and I think that will nuke my remaining spare time, and any availability I have left for Rust work. Good timing for me to make space on the core team, and to focus on my databases/distributed systems work.</p><p>I hope to remain active in the community, and hopefully next year, once things have settled down a bit at home, I can again contribute regularly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/content/images/2020/09/99312bc3-a432-415b-8366-9ad1eefd47bb.JPG" alt="Ultrasound image of my daughter"><figcaption>My next project, pre-launch</figcaption></figure>

<p>As an addendum on to our four-part look at the general structures of the farming of cereal grains (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">IV</a>) this post is going to briefly discuss some of the key ways that the structures of <strong><em>rice</em> <em>farming </em></strong>differ from the structures of wheat and barley farming.  We’ll start with some of the key differences in the mechanics of rice farming itself, before moving into how those differences might motivate different social and economic organization in the countryside, before finally discussing some of the theories as to how rice farming might – or might not – impact larger structures like the state.</p>

<p>(Quick bibliographic aside: I relied primary for this on Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (206 B.C. – A.D. 220) (1980) and F. Bray, <em>The Rice Economies: Technology and Development in Asian Societies </em>(1986) which were recommended to me by specialists in the field.  The latter is a wealth of technical details on rice cultivation, although it is as focused on the transition to mechanization and modern agriculture as to the conditions of pre-modern rice cultivation.)</p>



<h2>Rice Cultivation</h2>



<p>We want to start with the rice cultivation process.  There are a <em>lot</em> of varieties of rice out there, but the key divide we want to make early is between dry-rice and wet-rice.  When we’re talking about ‘rice cultures’ or ‘rice agriculture,’ generally, we mean wet-rice farming, where the rice is partially submerged during its growing.  Wild rice, as far as we can tell, began as a swamp-grass and thus likes to have quite a lot of water around, although precisely controlling the water availability can lead the rice to be a lot more productive than it would be in its natural habitat.  While there are varieties of rice which can be (and are) farmed ‘dry’ (that is, in unflooded fields much like wheat and barley are farmed), the vast majority of rice farming is ‘wet.’  As with grains, this is not merely a matter of different methods of farming, but of different varieties of rice that have been adapted to that farming; varieties of dry-rice and wet-rice have been selectively bred over millennia to perform best in those environments.</p>



<p>Wet-rice is farmed in paddies, small fields (often <em>very</em> small – some Chinese agronomists write that the ideal size for an individual rice field is around 0.1 hectare, which is just 0.24 acres) surrounded by low ‘bunds’ (small earthwork walls or dykes) to keep in the water, typically around two feet high.  Because controlling the water level is crucial, rice paddies must be very precisely flat, leading to even relatively gentle slopes often being terraced to create a series of flat fields.  Each of these rice paddies (and there will be many because they are so small) are then connected by irrigation canals which channel and control the water in what is often a quite complex system.</p>

<p>The exact timing of rice production is more complex than wheat because a single paddy often sees two crops in a year and the exact planting times vary between areas;  one common cycle on the Yangtze is for a February planting (with a June harvest) followed by a June planting (with a November harvest).  In other areas, paddies planted with rice during the first planting might be drained and sown with a different plant entirely (sometimes including wheat) in the intervening time.</p>



<p>The cycle runs thusly: after the heavy rains of the monsoons (if available), the field is tilled (or plowed, but as we’ll see, manual tillage is often more common).  The seed is then sown (or transplanted) and the field is, using the irrigation system, lightly flooded, so that the young seedlings grow in standing water.  Sometimes the seed is initially planted in a dedicated seed-bed and then transferred to the field, rather than being sown there directly; doing so has a positive impact on yields, but is substantially more labor intensive.  The water level is raised as the plant grows; agian this is labor intensive, but increases yields.  Just before the harvest the fields are drained out and allowed to dry out, before the crop is harvested and then goes into processing.</p>



<p>Rice is threshed much like grain (more often manually threshed and generally not threshed with flails) to release the seeds, the individual rice grains, from the plant.  That is going to free the endosperm of the speed, along with a hull around it and a layer of bran between the two.  Hulling was traditionally done by hand-pounding, which frees the seed from the hull, leaving just the endosperm and some of the bran; this is how you get <em>brown</em> rice, which is essentially ‘whole-grain’ rice.  While it is generally less <em>tasty</em>, the bran actually has quite a lot of nutrients not present in the calorie-rich endosperm.  Whereas <em>white rice</em> is produced by then milling or polishing away the bran to produce a pure, white kernal of the endosperm; it is very tasty, but lacks many of the vitamins that brown rice has.</p>



<p>Consequently, while a diet of mostly brown rice can be healthy, a diet overwhelmingly of <em>white rice</em> leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine_deficiency">Thiamine deficiency</a>, known colloquially as <em>beriberi</em>.  My impression from the literature is that this wasn’t as much an issue prior to the introduction of mechanical milling processes for rice. Mechanical milling made producing white rice in quantity cheap and so it came to dominate the diet to the exclusion of brown rice, producing negative health effects for the poor who could not afford to supplement their rice-and-millet diet with other foods, or for soldiers whose ration was in rice.  But prior to that mechanical milling, brown rice was all that was available for the poor, which in turn meant less Thiamine deficiency among the lower classes of society.</p>



<h2>Farmer Terrain</h2>



<p>Because rice is such a different crop than wheat or barley, there are a lot of differences in the way that rice cultivation shapes the countryside.  We’ll move here from the relatively direct impacts on the organization of farmers and then discuss the more speculative impacts on the organization of whole societies.</p>



<p>The thing to note about <strong>rice is that it is both <em>much</em> more productive on a per-acre basis than wheat or barley, but also <em>much</em> more labor intensive</strong>; it also relies on different forms of capital to be productive.  Whole-grain wheat and brown rice have similar calorie and nutritional value (brown rice is somewhat better in most categories) on a unit-weight basis (so, per pound or ton), but the yield difference is fairly large: rice is typically around (very roughly) 50% more productive per acre than wheat.  Moreover, rice plants have a more favorable ratio of seeds-to-plants, meaning that the demand to put away seeds for the next harvest is easier – whereas crop-to-seed ratios on pre-modern wheat range from 3:1 to 10:1, rice can achieve figures as high as 100:1.  As a result, not only is the gross yield higher (that is, more tons of seed per field) but a lower percentage of that seed has to be saved for the next planting.</p>

Of particular note is how small each individual field is (compare the village on the right-hand side!).</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the same time, the irrigation demands for effective production of wet-rice requires a <em>lot</em> of labor to build and maintain</strong>.  Fields need to be flooded and drained; in some cases (particularly pre-modern terrace farming) this may involve moving the water manually, in buckets, from lower fields to higher ones.  Irrigation canals connecting paddies can make this job somewhat easier, as can bucket-lifts (there’s a picture of a simple one below), but that still demands moving quite a lot of water.  In any irrigation system, the bunds need to be maintained and the water level carefully controlled, with also involves potentially quite a lot of labor.</p>



<p>The consequence of all of this is that while the rice farming household seems to be roughly the same size as the wheat-farming household (that is, an extended family unit of variable size, but typically around 8 or so members), <strong>the farm is much smaller</strong>, with common household farm sizes, even in the modern period, clustering around 1 hectare (2.47 acres) in comparison to the standard household wheat farms clustered around 4-6 acres (which, you may note with the yield figures above, lands us right back at around the same subsistence standard).</p>



<p>Moreover, rice cultivation is less soil dependent (but more water dependent) because wet-rice farming both encourages nitrogen fixation in the soil (maintaining the fertility of it generally without expensive manure use) and because rice farming leads naturally to a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podzol">pozdolisation</a>, slowly converting the underlying soil over a few years to a set of characteristics which are more favorable for more rice cultivation.  So whereas with wheat cultivation, where you often have clumps of marginal land (soil that is too wet, too dry, too rocky, too acidic, too uneven, too heavily forested, and so on), rice cultivation tends to be able to make use of almost any land where there is sufficient water (although terracing may be needed to level out the land).  The reliance on the rice itself to ‘terraform’ its own fields does mean that new rice fields tended to under-produce for the first few years.</p>

				<p>When it comes to modern web application development, MongoDB is the king. If you are a full stack programmer, you hear about MERN or MEAN stacks every day. The <b>M</b> is in every one of them and it stands for MongoDB. The free and open source community version of MongoDB powers a large number of Web applications. From its humble beginnings in 2007, MongoDB has come a long way. It is the primary product behind the company MongoDB Inc. with over 10 billion dollars in market capitalisation. Like many other products before and after, online advertising was the key catalyst behind the vision and development of MongoDB. The story of MongoDB is an interesting one and in this article, I will take you on a journey through the MongoDB land and its history.</p>
<h2>The Idea of the Humongous Database – The Beginnings</h2>
<p>The story of MongoDB has its beginnings much earlier than 2007. In 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Merriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Merriman</a> and Kevin O’Connor created the famous online advertising company DoubleClick. Kevin Ryan joined the team soon after(Dwight and Kevin later cofounded 5 companies together – Gilt, 10gen, Panther Express, ShopWiki and Business Insider). DoubleClick soon took off and within a few years it was serving as much as 400,000 ads/second. Such large scale traffic was not anticipated by the relational database technologies available at that time. Configuring relational databases for such scale also required substantial amount of money and hardware resources. So Dwight(who was the CTO at the time) and his team wrote custom database implementations to scale DoubleClick for the increased traffic. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early talks on MongoDB</a>, Dwight talks about getting a network hardware with serial number 7 and wondering whether it will work! This was even before the invention of load balancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-people.jpg" width="300px" alt="People behind MongoDB" title="People behind MongoDB">In 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Horowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliot Horowitz</a> joined DoubleClick R&amp;D division as a software engineer immediately after his college. Within 2 years he left DoubleClick to start ShopWiki along with Dwight. Both of them realised that they were solving the same horizontal scalability issues again and again. So in 2007, Dwight, Eliot and Kevin Ryan started a new company called 10gen. 10gen was focused on creating a PaaS hosting solution with its own application and database stack. 10gen soon got the attention of the venture capitalist Albert Wenger (Union Square Ventures) and he invested $1.5 million into it. This is what <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2008/07/10gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Wenger wrote in 2008 about the 10gen investment</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen. They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service. The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby. The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Albert was refering to as “the database with interesting design” was in fact MongoDB. Rapid development on the new database was undertaken from 2007 to 2009. The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e73188b5512c82290a4070af4afddac20d0b981e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first commit of the MongoDB database server by Dwight can be seen here</a>. The core engine was written in C++. The database was named MongoDB since the idea was to use it to store and serve humongous amount of data required in typical use cases such as content serving. Initially the team had only 4 engineers(including Dwight and Eliot) and decided to focus just on the MongoDB database instead of the initial PaaS product. The business idea was to release the database as an open source free download and offer commercial support and training services on top of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB 1.0 was released</a> in February 2009. The initial version focused on providing a usable query language with document model, indexing and basic support for replication. It also had experimental version of sharding, but production ready sharding clusters were available only in version 1.6 released a year later.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongodb-user/X0Le3mBel2I/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Dwight responded to a question</a> on the suitability of Mongo for a highly scalable system (MongoDB user group – September 2009),</p>
<blockquote><p>
For horizontal scaling, one would use auto-sharding to build out large MongoDB clusters.  This is in alpha now, but if your project is just getting started, it will be in production by the time you need it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Early MongoDB Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the early years, the basic design principles behind MongoDB development were the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data model for faster programming – document model with CRUD.</li>
<li>Use of familiar language and format – JavaScript/JSON.</li>
<li>Schema less documents for agile iterative development.</li>
<li>Only essential features for faster development and easy scaling. No join, no transactions across collections.</li>
<li>Support easy horizontal scaling and durability/availability (replication/sharding).</li>
</ul>
<p>In his ZendCon 2011 presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOQJpGu1kY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“NoSQL and why we created MongoDB”</a>, Dwight talks about these principles in detail. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=2408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 minutes mark</a>, there is also an interesting discussion on the difference between replication and sharding. As the database server code matured and once MongoDB hit the mainstream, many of these principles were obviously diluted. Latest MongoDB server versions support joining to some extend and since MongoDB 4.2, even distributed transactions are supported!</p>
<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>Before we get into detailed MongoDB history and how it evolved over the years, let us briefly look at what exactly it is!</p>
<p>MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database. It can run on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and the open source version is available as a free download. MongoDB stores data entities in a container called collection and each piece of data stored is in a JSON document format. For example, if a customer submits an online order, the entire details of that order (order number, order line items, delivery address etc.) are kept in a single hierarchical document in JSON format. It is then saved to a collection named “customer_order”.</p>
<p>MongoDB also comes with a console client called MongoDB shell. This is a fully functional JavaScript environment using which you can add, remove, edit or query document data in the database.</p>
<h2>MongoDB Architecture</h2>
<p>The following MongoDB architecture diagram provides a high level view of the major components in the MongoDB server.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-architecture.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB Architecture Diagram" title="MongoDB Architecture Diagram"></p>
<p>MongoDB currently offers <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers for 13 languages</a> including Java, Node.JS, Python, PHP and Swift. The storage engine MMAPv1 is removed since version 4.2. The encrypted storage engine is only supported in the commercial enterprise server.</p>
<p>The beauty of MongoDB is that using the same open source free community server you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a simple single machine instance suitable for most small applications.</li>
<li>Run a multi-machine instance with durability/high availability suitable for most business applications.</li>
<li>Run a large horizontally scaled cluster of machines(shard cluster) handling both very large sets of data and high volume of query traffic. MongoDB provides automatic infrastructure to distribute both data and its processing across machines. A typical use case would be running a popular ad service with thousands of customers and millions of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagrams show various options available for running MongoDB instances.</p>
<h2>Single Server/Fault Tolerant Setup</h2>
<p>For small applications, a single server setup is enough with frequent data backups. For installations that require fault tolerance, a replica set implementation can be done. In the fault tolerant deployment, usually there are 3 or more MongoDB instances. Only one of them work as the primary instance and if it fails, one of the other 2 secondaries takes over as the primary. The data is identical in all instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment1.jpg" width="800px" alt="Single server/fault tolerant setup" title="Single server/fault tolerant setup"></p>
<h2>Shard Cluster for Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>For a large database with both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance requirements, a MongoDB shard cluster is configured. As can be seen from the diagram below, minimum recommended number of machines for a fault tolerant shard cluster is 14! Each fault tolerant replica set in this case handles only a subset of the data. This data partitioning is automatically done by MongoDB engine.<br>
<img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment2.jpg" width="800px" alt="Shard cluster with partitioned data" title="Shard cluster with partitioned data"></p>
<p>When you download the latest version of MongoDB (4.4) and extract it, you will find that it contains only the following 3 main files,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mongo</b> – MongoDB shell for interacting with your server using JavaScript based commands.</li>
<li><b>mongod</b> – The MongoDB main executable. This can run as a single database instance, as a database member of a sharded cluster or as a configuration server of a sharded cluster.</li>
<li><b>mongos</b> – A router application only needed for sharded horizontally scaled cluster of database servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mac machine, the total size of these 3 executables is around 150MB. These are the only components you need for any type of MongoDB deployments! In a world of bloated software, this is a welcome change! This simplicity and elegance is what makes MongoDB so powerful and reliable.</p>
<h2>Evolution of MongoDB (2009 to 2020)</h2>
<p>MongoDB 1.0 was released in February 2009 and it had most of the basic query functionalities. MongoDB 1.2 was released in December 2009 and it introduced large scale data processing using map-reduce. Realising that MongoDB has good potential, 10gen quickly ramped up the team. MongoDB 1.4 (March 2010) introduced background index creation and MongoDB 1.6 (August 2010) introduced some major features such as production ready sharding for horizontal scaling, replica sets with automatic failover and IPv6 support.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-timeline1.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB 2009 to 2013" title="MongoDB 2009 to 2013"></p>
<p>By 2012, 10gen had 100 employees and the company started providing 24/7 support. MongoDB 2.2 release(August 2012) introduced aggregation pipeline enabling multiple data processing steps as a chain of …</p></div></div>

Having spent a lot of my childhood in Cornwall and still returning to this day, I always take the chance to get out on the water.</p><p>Obviously waves are powerful things, but there is more to their power than meets the eyes and I wanted to explore their true power.</p><p>A wave breaks when it wants, it is as powerful as it wants, the wave couldn’t care less if you’re riding it or not. There is no controlling it. It’s just you responding and reacting to the wave. Your reaction is all you can control. This creates a connection, a relationship between you and the water. One that you are a part of, but just to observe and react, all you can do is do your best and the wave will do its own thing. This connection is natural and raw, just you and the elements, nothing else is interfering or interrupting.</p><p>This connection with what’s around you and the earth, as you are riding the wave to the shore, also forms with fellow surfers riding the wave. Enjoying that same moment and experience, unique in many ways.</p><p>Nothing else is in the way or is there to disturb or interrupt you, there is a indisputable focus on the present. As if time is slowing down, watching the colours, ripples and feeling the undercurrent, strength and force of the wave. Lots of this happens subconsciously but this focus on the present can be hard to replicate elsewhere.</p><p>Waves are continuous, if you miss one, another is on the horizon. If you mess it up, then you can try again on the next. You just do your best and keep at it. There is something liberating about the idea you can just try again the next day and that’s ok. No pressure, limit or finiteness.</p><p>The artistic nature of the waves swirling, building and crashing is beautiful to watch, especially up close. It’s as if the movement has emotion, yet is unaware and not caring of what’s in front. As if it has a mind of it’s own.</p><p>The true power of waves is more than just the force of the water then.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, <a href="https://www.mattswain.co.uk/newsletter">sign up to my newsletter </a>for more ideas,  thoughts and insights into thinking without limits. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Imagine a computer-based system visualizing your thoughts and secret thoughts; yes, it's possible now by artificial intelligence assistance. Recent advancements in hardware innovation have re-energized technology. It becomes more accurate, authentic, can produce better sound, accurate visualization, and understanding of the location. Outstanding computer processors support computer to make a decision, plan outputs and don't repeat the mistake as they learn from it. The four scientists in Kyoto at Kyoto University did an exceptional experiment that exceeds the global expectations about such a dreamy truth. </p><p>Tomoyasu Horikawa, Guohua Shen, Yukiyasu Kamitani, and Kei Majima recently published their <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf">results in a paper </a>on a scientific research platform &nbsp;BioRxiv. They have done their experiment in ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. Their study mainly exposes the decoding of human thoughts using an artificially intelligent system. &nbsp;The artificial intelligence system becomes so smart and real to duplicate human minds and show what they're thinking in their minds. &nbsp;Now scientists are successful in developing the next phase of AI machine, which uses human psychology. It is a leading technology from science fiction to merely science phenomena.</p><p>Below video is demonstration of Tomoyasu’s work. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrO1v7-KcXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-is-helping-human-beings"><a href="https://thinkml.ai/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-common-people/">Machine Learning is helping human beings</a> </h3><p>Machine learning is in use since many years ago in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. It helped generate a visual impact of human thinking in the form of binary mages or geographic shapes. The images obtained are of simple shapes or pixels. However, another prediction that the human brain thinks in unique patterns of image creation; different thinking levels, either with simple or complex components.</p><p>The idea of processing human thoughts is not new as we can see 1950s videos where doctors used to put contraptions on the human brain. It helps them to decipher the thoughts always running in their patient's minds. A British Serial <strong>Quatermass and the Pit </strong>shows a similar technique to translate the alien's thoughts.</p><p>The scientists from the United States, China, and Japan utilize this fantasy to change it into reality. They use <strong>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </strong>strategy for better measurement of brain activity. The deep neural networks involved in replicating human brain functioning procedure.</p><h3 id="the-emergence-of-artificial-people-with-machine-learning-system">The emergence of Artificial People with Machine Learning System</h3><p>Machines come with consciousness and result in developing a direct relationship between humans and machines. The day is coming when robots not only talk but can laugh, fight, and be cruel with the power of advancement in technology. Some research laboratories are busy making a force that can sense its surrounding environment and show response according to it. They sense human thoughts running in their minds and visualize to others. It's beneficial to know and see the thoughts of those quality people who are extraordinary but can't speak.</p><p>Alan Turing said:</p><blockquote>‘’If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, it is as intelligent as a human being.’’</blockquote><h3 id="is-it-telepathy-or-something-advanced">Is it Telepathy or Something Advanced?</h3><p>The whole world is excited about the news of AI reading minds, but the reality is somewhat not as same as appearing to us. Machine learning is still unable to detect rightly what we think, feel, desire, wish, or need at a specific time. The science is aiming to decipher the images that subjects see for a period. Thus, machine learning uses a reconstruction of a visual filed algorithm for a visual demonstration of thoughts.</p><p>In the last years, scientists strive to create a system that can judge images based on their shapes, characters, and letters when a subject’s mind view them.</p><h3 id="kyoto-university-research-by-four-scientists">Kyoto University Research by Four Scientists</h3><p>The advances in the development of artificial intelligence also use a <strong>deep neural network </strong>to decode human thoughts. &nbsp;They aimed to develop a method that not only deciphers the images but also regenerate the same one. Therefore, the four efficient scientists at Kyoto University utilized the BioRxiv platform and <strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN)</strong> as a proxy to share their findings of thought decoding. These neural systems help decode images of thoughts in the human brain and produce a visual prediction that resembles a person's thinking.</p><p>More generalized; the system should visualize the image about which its system is not trained previously after decoding the thoughts. &nbsp;It can see or covert human thoughts into images.</p><h3 id="how-does-ai-can-visualize-our-thinking-process">How Does AI Can Visualize our Thinking Process? </h3><p>The basis of this system is to scan the human brain deeply. For this purpose, the scientists introduce fMRI (Functional MRI) that scans the brain's core over traditional MRI that involves only monitoring brain activity. The unusual behavior of fMRI is its ability to track <strong>blood flow </strong>to the brain and <strong>brainwaves. </strong></p><p>It takes data from the scan and interprets what the subject was thinking when data was taken from it? The actual decoding occurs in the <strong>complex neural network </strong>that converts data into image format. But the humans have to rain the system first to get-go everything. They train the machine about the human brain thinking strategy that how it works and make a solution. It gets information from blood flow as it tracks blood's path, way, direction, and speed to reach the brain.</p><p>After it, the system starts producing images related to the information it gets by tracking blood flow. The process is only possible if the system comes with multilayers of <strong>deep neural networks. DNN</strong>involves the processing of information in image form. The information is then carried towards <strong>Deep Generator Network (DGN) Algorithm, </strong>which finally creates the image with high precision and accuracy. If we obtain images without using DGN, we can't get a high resolution or clear images of a different thought. DGN captures faces, eyes, and textual patterns and produces high-quality visual clues. With an efficient DGN algorithm, efficiency can be exceeded to 99%, and highly matching decoded images are obtained.</p><h3 id="the-methodology-of-the-experiment-deep-image-reconstruction">The methodology of the Experiment; Deep Image Reconstruction</h3><p>In simple words, the system consists of two necessary steps:</p><p>1. &nbsp;A subject sees an image, and the same image is shown to the AI system; thus, it can recreate its image.<br>2. &nbsp;After it, the subject’s brain thinks about that image, and AI recreates the same image by showing real-time response.</p><p>The scientists selected three subjects and showed them natural geometric shapes, artificial images, and other objects of varying characters. They repeated the same exposure of showing objects in varying periods for almost ten weeks and recorded their brainwaves. In <strong>experiment number one</strong>, they recorded the brain activity of the subject when seeing the particular object out of 25. In contrast, they measured brain activity by hiding the image and asked the brain to think about it (<strong>experiment number 2</strong>). </p><p>In both scenarios, they recorded the image created by artificial intelligence and then compared them to get staggering results. The filtered data is considered as a template of sorts. Then they used a decoder to identify the images via fMRI. They scanned brain activity and used the reverse-engineered method to produce an image of information obtained from thoughts. The scientists enabled <strong>deep learning networks </strong>to understand the brainwaves and decode its information to get output.</p><p>AI is so fast as it has the power of guessing about a particular problem. It asks and answers its questions at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="ai-visualizing-static-thoughts">AI Visualizing Static Thoughts </h3><p>Results were outstanding as the computer reconstructed that image but with low accuracy. The quality of images in both experiments was fizzy and comparatively low in the second experiment case. The reason was that it's difficult for a brain to remember an image as identical as it is. It enables scientists to decode ''hieratical'' images with various colors, pixels, and formations. The system establishes, for instance, can predict a picture of a bird, a plant, or an animal. Technology goes on proceeding towards refinement for better implementation of a particular process. </p><h3 id="statement-of-kamitani-about-the-project">Statement of Kamitani About the Project</h3><p>Kamitani was excited about their mutual hard work and getting mind-blowing results. He talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>as:</p><blockquote>‘’We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person sees just by looking at its brain activity. Our previous method was to suppose that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.''</blockquote><blockquote>'These neural networks or AI models can be used as a proxy for the human brain's hierarchical structure,' he added more. </blockquote><h3 id="ai-decoding-videos-you-re-watching-from-your-brain-activity">AI Decoding Videos You’re Watching from Your Brain Activity</h3><p>There is another group of scientists who published their research on ‘<strong>’Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision’’ </strong>in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>. They developed deep learning algorithms to scan the human brain and its working principles to decode its information.</p><p>Their experiment was based on three women who watched videos of hundreds of unique categories for several hours, and the scientists recorded their brain activity. The videos were on birds, airplanes, and other related objects. They obtained images from a popular Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision. The scientists used a functional MRI machine that measures signals of activity in the visual cortex. As the women watched several clips, the deep learning algorithms predicted activity closely related to the actual brain activity. Dozens of brain parts respond to a specific thought; thus, the artificial system mimics natural brain working strategies and shows visible results. </p><p>It also helped scientists to recognize which part of the cortex is involved in thought …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Dijkstra famously dissed testing by saying “Program testing can be used to show
the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”
As if you should choose one over the other.
I don’t see them as opposites but as complementary techniques that
should both be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of formal verification.
Formal verification tools can be the best bug-finding tools you have
ever used.
And they can completely eliminate entire classes of bugs from your code.
But, formal verification won’t find bugs in your
specification; or in your assumptions about your dependencies; or in your
build/CI harness, etc. (See <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/fonseca:ecs:2017">Fonseca</a> for more examples
of where testing has found bugs in formally verified systems.)</p>

<p>And, we all reluctantly agree that Dijkstra was right: even a thorough,
perfectly executed test plan can miss bugs.</p>

<p>So, for the last few months, I have been trying to have both.
We (my team and I at Google) have been reimplementing Jason Lingle’s
<a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest">proptest</a> property-testing library for use with Rust formal verification tools.
The original proptest lets you write test harnesses to test that your code
(probably) satisfies properties.
Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">a reimplementation of the proptest interface</a>
that enables you to use exactly the same test harnesses to
formally verify that the properties hold.
So far, we have only tried this with the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a>
but our implementation is based on the verification
interface used in <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/">verification competitions</a> so it should be
possible to port our library to many other verification tools.<sup id="fnref:for-Rust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:for-Rust">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[Before I go any further, I should mention that what we are <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">releasing this
week</a> is a very early research prototype.  It is not ready for serious use
and it is definitely not an official, supported Google product.  We are
releasing it now, in its current, immature state because we want to have
a conversation about how programmers want to formally verify Rust code
and we think that it is helpful to have something to push against.
We welcome pull requests that add support for other verifiers, or that
push the design in a better direction.]</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proptest-test-harness">A proptest test harness</h2>

<p>To get an idea for what property testing looks like in <code>proptest</code>,
we’ll look at an example from the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">proptest book</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_add(a in 0..1000i32, b in 0..1000i32) {
        let sum = add(a, b);
        assert!(sum &gt;= a);
        assert!(sum &gt;= b);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example defines a property called <code>test_add</code> that tests a function called
<code>add</code>.  In particular, it checks that, for non-negative values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the
result of <code>sum(a, b)</code> is at least as large as <code>a</code> and as <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The notation <code>0..1000i32</code> represents the set of all values in the range <code>[0 ..
1000)</code> and the notation <code>a in 0..1000i32</code> says that a value <code>a</code> should be
chosen from that set.</p>

<p>The <code>proptest!</code> macro converts this property into a test function
that repeatedly generates random values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and executes the
body of the property.</p>

<p>(After adding in <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">some additional glue code</a>) we can run this example with the command</p>



<p>which produces the following output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, if we deliberately write a property that doesn’t hold, then <code>cargo test</code>
produces output more like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

---- test_add stdout ----
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'Test failed: assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100; minimal failing input: a = 0, b = 0
        successes: 0
        local rejects: 0
        global rejects: 0
', src/main.rs:7:1


failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="verifying-with-propverify">Verifying with propverify</h2>

<p>Proptest checks the above property by generating random values and testing.
But we can also interpret the property as saying that for all values
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the sets, the body of the property will not panic.
That is, we can interpret it as a universally quantified specification.</p>

<p>To verify the above property, we use a script that compiles the Rust
code, invokes the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a> and filters
the output of KLEE to determine whether there is any choice of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> that can cause the body of the property to panic.</p>



<p>This produces output like this: confirming that the property does hold</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Running 1 test(s)
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed
VERIFICATION_RESULT: VERIFIED
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, if we change the example property so that the property does not hold,
<code>cargo-verify</code> produces this output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9

running 1 test
  Value a = 0
  Value b = 0
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On this example, random testing and formal verification produced similar
results.
I could have chosen an example where formal verification found a bug that
random testing misses.
Or I could have chosen an example where random testing easily finds
a bug but formal verification spins forever.
But, in this post, I wanted to focus on the similarity between the two
approaches, not the differences.</p>

<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>

<p>In this article, we used an example that was easy to explain but
does not really show off the power of <code>propverify</code>.
Some slightly better examples are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/compatibility-test/src/collections.rs#L60">collections.rs</a>
where we check properties involving standard Rust collection
types such as vectors and B-trees.
(This should be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/collection/index.html">proptest
documentation</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/0a6a0ff2b3880eb4a19d8161bfae8d163b0a65ec/compatibility-test/src/dynamic.rs#L82">dynamic.rs</a>
where we check properties involving trait objects by
quantifying over a subset of the possible instances of the trait.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, we have more documentation about</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-propverify.md">Using the propverify library</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-annotations.md">Using the lower level <code>verification-annotations</code> API</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-klee.md">The many, many flags we use when compiling Rust code so that it can be verified with KLEE</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two are mostly for the benefit of verification tool developers.</p>

<h2 id="our-next-steps">Our next steps</h2>

<p><em>[You can either read this as a sketch of what we plan to do or
as an admission of what we have not yet done.
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Fred and Ginger said</a>,
“Tomato. Tomato.”]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tools have a horrifically complicated set of dependencies.</p>

    <p>This is partly because formal verification is not quite popular
enough for enough Debian/Homebrew packages to exist and partly
because we need some very specific versions.
(It may also be possible to remove some dependencies!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-verifier">Crux-MIR</a> support to the library
and tool.
Crux-MIR is a new part of Galois’
<a href="https://galois.com/project/software-analysis-workbench/">Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)</a>
that verifies the MIR code generated by the Rust compiler.</p>

    <p>This is taking us a bit longer than using KLEE
because the functionality of our <code>cargo-verify</code> script
overlaps with the functionality of Crux-MIR but they have slightly different
approaches – we’re still working on the best way to handle the resulting
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to focus our attention on a single crate at a time.
We have some ideas for how to do that with fuzzing and verification
but we have not had a chance to try them yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not looked seriously at how well this approach scales.</p>

    <p>The collections support in the <code>propverify</code> library has a few
tricks to avoid some obvious scaling issues, but we don’t know if
those tricks work well for all verification tools and they
probably only scratch the surface of what needs to be done.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing and formal verification are usually portrayed as mortal enemies.
I think that misses a huge opportunity to use your existing familiarity and
comfort with testing to let you get value out of formal verification tools.</p>

<p>I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">our library and tool</a>,
try it out and give us feedback.
If you are working on a Rust verification tool, we would love it
if you tried to use our library with your tool.
And we would love it even more if you sent us a pull request.</p>

<p>It’s probably not a good idea to commit to using the library at this stage:
it is not very robust at the moment and I expect that it will change a lot
as we gain experience from porting the library to other types of
formal verification tools.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<section>
			<p>When we are storing data, we typically assume that our storage system of choice returns that data later just as we put it in.
However what guarantees do we have that this is actually the case?
The case made here is the case of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-bit-rot-and-how-can-i-detect-it-rhel">bitrot</a>, the silent degradation of the physical charges that physically make up today’s storage devices.</p>
<p>To counter this type of problem, one can employ data checksumming, as it is done by both btrfs and ZFS.
However, while in the long run btrfs might be the tool of choice for this, it is fairly complex and not yet too mature, whereas ZFS, the most prominent candidate for this type of features, is <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/8314">not</a> <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/">without</a> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/zfs-licensing-and-linux">hassle</a> and it must be recompiled for every kernel update (although <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Custom-Packages">automation exists</a>).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we’ll therefore take a look into a storage design that actually checks whether the returned data is actually valid and not silently corrupted inside our storage system and is completely designed with components available in Linux itself without the need to recompile and test your storage layer on every kernel upgrade.
We find that this storage design, while fulfilling the same purpose as ZFS, does not only yield comparable performance, but actually in some cases even able to significantly outperform it, as the benchmarks at the end indicate.</p>

<p>The system we will test in the following will be constructed from four components (including the filesystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dm-integrity</strong> provides blocklevel checksumming for all incoming data and will check said checksum for all data read through it (and return a read error if it doesn’t match).</li>
<li><strong>mdraid</strong> provides redundancy if a disk misbehaves, avoiding data loss. If the dm-integrity-layer detects invalid data from the disk, mdraid will see a read-error and can immediately correct this error by reading it from somewhere else in the redundancy pool.</li>
<li><strong>dm-crypt</strong> on top of the RAID, right below the filesystem will encrypt the data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>ext4</strong> as a filesystem to actually store files on it</li>
</ul>
<p>The order matters, dm-integrity must be placed between the harddisks and the mdraid, to ensure that data corruption errors can be corrected by mdraid after they have been detected by dm-integrity. Similarly, dm-crypt has nothing to do with redundancy, therefore it should be placed on top of of mdraid, to only having to be passed once, and not multiple times as it would be the case for placing it alongside dm-integrity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This yields the following storage design:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Storage system architecture</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture of the storeage system. Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems.

Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems. The encryption layer will later be ommitted when comparing performance to ZFS.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/mkstorage.sh.txt">This script will assemble the above depicted system and mount it to /mnt.</a></p>

<p>Now that we have an assembled system, we’d like to quantify the performance impact of the different layers.
The test setup for this is a <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Kobol Helios4</a> (primarily because it’s the intended target platform for this storage system) with four disks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> running Debian 10 “Buster”.
The Helios4 is powered by an energy efficient dual-core ARM SoC optimized for storage systems.
The setup was not built based on the entire disks, but on partitions of a size of 10GiB each, allowing multiple parallel designs and therefore easing the benchmarking procedure, as well as speeding up the experiments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="layer-analysis-of-performance-impact">Layer analysis of performance impact</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>To benchmark throughput, the following commands were used:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=8000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure was repeated ten times for proper statistics for the different cases for both read (<code>r</code>) and write (<code>w</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4 filesystem only (<code>f</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>encryption, topped by ext4 (<code>cf</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>mdraid (RAID6/double parity), topped by the former (<code>rcf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
<li>the final setup, including integrity (<code>ircf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layers.svg" alt="Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see different interesting results in the data:
First of all, the encryption engine on the helios4 is not completely impact free, although the resulting performance is still more than sufficient for the designated uses for a Helios4.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see that adding integrity layer does have a noticable impact on writing, but a negligible impact on reading, indicating that especially for systems primarily intended to read data from adding the integrity layer is a matter of negligible cost.</p>
<p>For write-heavy systems, the performance impact is more considerable, but for certain workloads, such as the home-NAS-case the Helios is designed for, the performance can still be considered fully sufficient, especially as normally the system would cache those writes to a certain extend, which was explicitly disabled for benchmarking purposes (see <code>conv=fdatasync</code> in the benchmark procedure).</p>
<p>The reason for the degradation in write (but not in read) is likely due to the fact that the integrity layer and the mdraid layer are decoupled from one another, the raid-layer is not aware that for a double parity setup it effectively has to write the same information three times, and the integrity layer has to account for all three writes before the data is considered synced as required by <code>conv=fdatasync</code>.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>We have found that the throguhput of such a storage design is yielding useful throughput-rates.
The next question is about the latency of the system, which we will, for simplicity, only estimate for random 4K-reads.
Again, just as above, we will investigate the impact of the different layers of the system.
To do so, we read 100.000 sectors randomly from an 18GB sized testfile filling the storage mountpoint for each configuration after dropping all caches.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Latency comparison of system layers</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layerlatencies.svg" alt="Distribution of latencies in milliseconds for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system. green denotes the median, black denotes the average of the latencies of the respective setup, access times below 1ms were considered cache hits and therefore excluded for the computation of mean and average.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure above yields several interesting insights:
First of all, we do see cache hits close to zero milliseconds, furthermore, we see that the latency distribution is fairly evenly distributed over the available range and finally and most interestingly, we see that the impact of the several layers onto the latency is measurable, but rather irrellevant for typical practical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-comparison-with-zfs">Performance comparison with ZFS</h2>
<p>So far we have tested the setup on its intended target platform, the Helios4.
To compare the resulting system against the elephant in the room, ZFS, we will use a different test platform, based on an Intel i7-2600K as CPU and 4x1TB disks, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> was not reliably buildable on Debian Buster on ARM, and when it actually built, it explicitly stated that 32bit-processors (as the Helios’ CPU) are not supported by upstream, although technically the system would run.</p>
<p>To allow for a cleaner comparison, the testbed was accordinly changed to accomodate for ZFS’s preferences.
As ZFS did not adhere to <code>conv=fdatasync</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the main memory was restricted to 1GB, swap was turned off and the size of the testfile was chosen to be 18GB.
This way, any caching happening would be at least significantly reduced as there was little space next to the OS inside of the main memory for caching.</p>
<p>All tests were run on a Debian 10 “Buster” with Linux 4.19, ZFS was used in form of the package <code>zfs-dkms</code> in version 0.8.2 from backports.
The storage layer for both setups was layouted with double parity (RAID6/raidz2) and, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> package in Debian was not able to do encryption, the mdraid-based setup was also setup without the encryption layer.</p>
<h3 id="throughput-1">Throughput</h3>
<p>The commands used for benchmarking throughput were conceptually the same as above:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=18000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>Although ZFS seemingly does not adhere to any cache dropping or syncing instructions, they were still performed and adhered to by the mdraid-based setup.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput comparison, zfs &amp; md</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-md-throughput.svg" alt="Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-testbed.txt">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The results are very interesting: While the md-based setup performs less consistent in and of itself, it still consistently outperforms ZFS in read performance.
When it comes to write, though, ZFS performs noticably better.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To investigate the cause of this unexpected balance, we note that while ZFS combines raid, integrity and filesystem in one component, for the md-based setup these are separate components.
Of these components, not only the filesystem, but also the <code>dm-integrity</code> implements journalling to avoid inconsistencies in case of a power outage.
This leads to increased work until the transaction has been fully flushed to disk, which can be seen in the next figure, where the md-based system (without the encryption layer) is tested with both journalling enabled and disabled in the integrity layer:</p>
<figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599156332456/7WwIJcqD0.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We all use some VS Code extensions for our day to day development and are always on a hunt for more useful extensions. Here is a list of mine and how I use them:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.peacockcode.dev/">Peacock</a> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593585542633/58FKxSF2u.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt=""></p>
<p>We have all been there when we have two editors open and coded in the wrong one 🤦  Peacock helps me differentiate between different workspaces by setting a different color theme to VS Code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/activeScopeBorder.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easily distinguishable bracket scopes are always good for programming and this extension does it well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/printscreen-select-lines.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you are in the flow but navigating the code from one function to another becomes tedious, this lets you bookmark code at different lines and you can easily access it using shortcuts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There have been times when I have embarrassingly spent more time than needed debugging an error only to find out it was a spelling mistake. This extension keeps that in check.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auiworks.amvim">AmVim</a></p>
<p> I am a huge fan of Vim, it legit increases your productivity without having to touch the trackpad. AmVim is one of the Vim mode extension for VSCode, I found this to be quite good and not bloaty compared to other Vim extensions.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">Settings Sync</a></p>
<p>Settings Sync helps you keep the same environment of VSCode (extensions and preferences) across machines.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log">Turbo Console log</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dysw7p/insert_log_message.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is really useful while debugging, it helps create meaningful logs using shortcuts. All you have to do is highlight the variable and press the keybindings.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode">Tab Nine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/raw/master/assets/tabnine.gif" alt="sdfsdf"></p>
<p>I just recently came across this one in one of <a href="https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips">Chris Bongers</a>'s article. Really like it! It is sometimes just scary how accurately it predicts auto-completion (It uses deep-learning model locally on your machine to come up with the predictions).</p>
<hr><p>
Other than these I use the common ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon theme</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight">Color Highlight</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wart.ariake-dark">Ariake Dark</a> is my VS Code theme.</p>

<p>Hope you found this useful and feel free to share the extensions you use in the comments below. You can also @ me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vamsirao7">twitter</a></p>

<p>How much does running a webapp in production actually cost? Maybe more than you think. Keepthescore.co is a Python flask application running on DigitalOcean and Firebase. It currently has around 55k unique visitors per month, per day it’s around 3.4k.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/money-tree.jpg" alt="A money tree">
<em>Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@micheile">Micheile Henderson</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s a monthly breakdown with some background information on each cost:</p>

<h3 id="servers-and-database-on-digitalocean">Servers and database on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $95</strong></p>

<p>The webapp runs on two identical DigitalOcean servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 80GB disk). We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>, which is a great way of running and hosting a webapp (more on that in a future post) but it does mean that you need 2 identical production servers.</p>

<p>The database is a hosted Postgres instance also on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Note: the servers are oversized for the load we’re currently seeing. The reason for that is that we tried to solve a production issue by increasing the server specs. It didn’t solve the problem, and now we can’t down-size the servers without re-provisioning them 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="code-repo-on-github">Code repo on GitHub</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $0</strong></p>

<p>This is free. Thanks GitHub!
</p><hr>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $60</strong></p>

<p>We use a reporting tool called <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to generate insights and reports from the database. The tool itself is opensource and free, but hosting it is fairly expensive. Currently it runs on an EC2 instance. There are definitely some savings that could be realised here.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $1.32</strong></p>

<p>We use Firebase for the <a href="https://keepthescore.co/basketball-scoreboard/">realtime basketball scoreboard</a>. We also use the Google Sheets API for some custom scoreboards. Overall it must be said that the Google Cloud APIs are great value for money (so far).</p>

<p>We have plans to move away from DigitalOcean and onto Google Cloud infrastructure in the next year.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="dns-hosting">DNS hosting</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $5</strong></p>

<p>Our domain is registered with <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple.com</a>.
</p><hr>



<p><strong>Costs per month: $10</strong></p>

<p>Scoreboards and this blog have the option of allowing a discussion on the same page – this uses the <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> service. Disqus has a free tier but they began showing ads so we were forced to move to the paid tier.</p>

<p>We are planning to move to <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a> in the future, which is cheaper, has no ads, and respects your privacy.
</p><hr>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-it-is-there-revenue">Is it worth it? Is there revenue?</h2>

<p>In total that’s around <strong>$171 USD per month</strong>. If you’re running a company with employees that would be peanuts, but in this case the cost is being borne by a single indie-developer out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is that on the revenue side there’s a big fat zero. This is the reason why we are currently working on monetization. This will include banner ads and payments via Stripe. Expect to see these features land by next week! Anyway, more about that in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-spending-way-too-much-money">You are spending way too much money!</h2>

<p>This post generated an interesting discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24372084">Hacker News</a>. One recurring theme
was that our stack is large and expensive and that we could massively reduce costs.</p>

<p>This is true. But here are some things that are also true:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Reducing costs” is not our primary objective at the moment: time is more valuable than money right now.</li>
<li>Our primary objective right now is velocity of product development.</li>
<li>We are not devops experts and optimizing operations takes time.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a follow up post once we do optimize our stack.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and so long, 👋</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>new</span>
  <span>FixedArray</span><span>{</span><span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedArrayMap</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span> <span>objects</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span><span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>
    <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedDoubleArrayMap</span><span>,</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span>
    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

  <div>
    
    <p>Earlier this year, we contributed a driver for the Input/Output Memory
Management Unit (IOMMU) introduced with the Allwinner H6 SoCs in Linux,
that got merged in Linux 5.8. It felt like a good occasion to write
about what an IOMMU is, what it’s useful for and how it integrates into
Linux.</p>

<p>At the low-level, a CPU executes an infinite sequence of instructions,
some of them either reading or writing to an address in memory.
Depending on the system design, the hardware maps that address to the
main RAM of the system, or to a specific device. The set of all the
memory addresses than the CPU can access is the memory space.</p>
<p>In older or simpler designs, the CPU accesses directly the physical
location on the memory bus of a memory word or register, the physical
address. This simple design is still in use on some micro-controllers
today, but it introduces some issues related to security, and
reliability.</p>
<p>Indeed, that design doesn’t enforce any isolation between processes or
permission checks. This means that any process in the system has
read/write access to the entire memory in the system, including the
kernel and other applications. This could lead to a system-wide memory
corruption if a buggy application starts to write at some random place
in memory. And this is the ideal scenario: indeed, it also allowed any
process to snoop on any memory stored by another process or the kernel,
leading to potential sensitive information leaks if that process was
malicious.</p>
<p>To fix that issue, CPU designs introduced a hardware unit called the
Memory Management Unit (MMU) that intercepts all the memory accesses
done by the CPU once enabled and translates them. This mechanism allows
to have two distinct address spaces: the physical address space that we
talked about earlier, and a virtual address space that the CPU operates
on, the MMU being in charge of translating the virtual addresses into
physical addresses when the CPU access them.</p>
<p>The best part is that the kernel can change the virtual address space
anytime, so it actually uses one virtual address space per process (and
potentially one for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">kernel</a>). In
addition, the MMU also allows to set extra attributes to carry out
access control over memory ranges, allowing to change whether we want to
allow the associated process to read, write, or execute the data stored
in a particular range.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows the kernel to prevent any process to messing with
the memory of another process at the hardware level, almost entirely
closing the class of attacks we mentioned earlier, and enables
the operating system to provide more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_virtual_memory_management">optimizations</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">features</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it looks complete, there’s a limitation though: the MMU
translates the addresses used by the <strong>CPU</strong>. Yet, some devices can also
access memory directly without the CPU intervention using a feature
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</a>,
and since the CPU isn’t involved, the MMU isn’t either. This means that we’re
still vulnerable to the same class of issues than the one we described earlier
if we perform a misconfigured DMA operation or if an attacker
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack">manages</a> to trick a device
into reading some other parts of the memory than the one it’s supposed
to access. As an example of such an attack, you can find an in-depth
article explaining how the Google Project Zero team was able to pull
this off on a Nexus 6 modem
<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To close that channel of attacks, system designers later integrated
IOMMUs, that fill pretty much the same needs and with the same features
than regular MMUs, but providing that translation and protection to
devices that perform DMA instead of the CPU. It’s not unusual to even
have several IOMMUs: the GPU almost always has its own, and then there
would be another one for the rest or a subset of the devices in the
system.</p>
<p>IOMMUs also allow to address a common issue where the device isn’t able
to access the entirety of the buffer for some reason. It mainly happens
either when the buffer it’s supposed to perform DMA on isn’t contiguous
in physical memory and is thus split between some chunks while the
device can solely perform DMA on a single chunk; or when the device
can’t access the buffer location in RAM due to some limitations. One
common limitation would be that devices can just access the lowest 4 GB
of the RAM (since it’s addressable on 32 bits), while the system might
have more than that. Either way, the way to deal with that situation is
to create a <em>bounce buffer</em>: a temporary buffer that the device can
access and where we’re going to copy the content of the original buffer
to so that the device can access it. There’s an obvious performance cost
to it though, since we could introduce a copy of the whole buffer before
the device can operate on it. Still, IOMMUs save the day once again
since you can basically create any mapping, both accommodating the
non-contiguous case by creating a mapping where the virtual buffer would
be contiguous, and using a virtual address that the device can access.</p>

<h2 id="the-iommu-framework">The IOMMU Framework</h2>
<p>Since an IOMMU is so useful, Linux gained support for IOMMUs using a
dedicated driver framework under <strong>drivers/iommu</strong>. That framework uses
three different concepts to enforce permissions as fine-grained as
possible for a given device: domains, groups, and devices.</p>
<p>A device is quite straightforward, it’s a device that can perform DMA
operations through our IOMMU, a domain is a representation of a virtual
address space and a group is a set of devices that the IOMMU can’t
isolate from each other. The framework then relies on functions to
manage those three concepts. As you can see in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/iommu.h#n191">the operations that a driver can perform</a>,
all those functions are to manage the relationships between the devices,
groups and domains that the system is going to have, and manage each
individually (to create a mapping in a particular domain for example).</p>
<h2 id="the-dma-api">The DMA API</h2>
<p>The second part of the integration in Linux, once it knows how to
manage the various address spaces through the IOMMU framework and
drivers, is to allow the drivers for the devices that need to perform
DMA to use that IOMMU.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of Linux is to be as portable as possible, and it
does so by abstracting much of the usual driver operations through
frameworks and APIs, and allows to decouple the driver itself (how does
one need to program a device to perform a given operation) from how the
platform works (in our case, how would the platform do DMA, or how
should Linux configure the IOMMU).</p>
<p>DMA is no different here, and Linux has two distinct APIs depending on
the context: the streaming API and the coherent API. As we mentioned
earlier, you would use one over the other depending on the situation
you’re in, and who is in charge of allocating the buffer that gets
accessed through DMA. If the user-space hands the buffer to the driver
(for example when you would send a network packet, or write to a file),
you’d need to setup a temporary mapping through the streaming API. In
other situations though, the kernel would be in charge of allocating the
buffer and then pass that buffer to the user-space—the Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) and Video4Linux2 (v4l2) can operate like that—, and that
would be where you’d need the coherent API.</p>
<p>The two APIs are here to make sure that the device can perform DMA on
the buffer we want to access. They thus make sure that the device can
access the buffer. What it actually means then depends on the platform,
what memory range the device can access, which memory allocator to use,
etc. Part of that decision involves whether the device accesses go
through an IOMMU, which then gets configured properly to create the
mappings for our buffer in the device’s virtual address space.</p>

<p>We contributed to Linux 5.8 a driver for the IOMMU introduced by
Allwinner in their H6 SoC. Compared to the IOMMUs found on modern PCs,
its design is a bit simple: it doesn’t support virtualization, there’s a
single address space, and it doesn’t cover all the devices doing DMA in
the system but solely the DMA intensive ones: the video and display
devices.</p>
<p>The driver thus registers and allows a single domain and group since the
IOMMU can’t isolate devices from one another, and it supports a single
address space. Despite these limitations though, it’s still a welcome
addition for all the reasons above.</p>
<p>Video and display controllers also require a lot of big, contiguous
buffers allocated through the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) on
earlier SoCs. CMA works by putting aside a part of the system RAM at
boot, and allocating big buffers from that area. There’s a big drawback
now though: the system has to maintain a rather big (in the 100 MB
order), static, pool of RAM put aside, no matter if the system is going
to use its video or display capabilities, and without any way to give
the RAM back if it doesn’t. As we discussed, an IOMMU has the capability
to map several, separate, chunks in physical memory to provide a
contiguous buffer in the device virtual space, effectively reducing (or
even removing) the need for CMA.</p>

<p>With Linux 5.8 onward, the Allwinner H6 uses its IOMMU with the DRM
display driver and the Cedrus video decoder driver. As time goes by and
we enable its usage across more drivers, it benefits more devices.
And with any luck, more Allwinner SoCs will feature an IOMMU.</p>

<p><img alt="Libvirt The Unsung Hero of Cloud Computing Platforms" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_the_unsung_hero.png"></p><p>Initially my intention was to write an article on <strong>Round up of open source Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)</strong>, but while doing research found one piece of software library so fundamental, that it holds the key to very existence of Cloud Computing services and platforms as we know it today (that includes Amazon AWS, OpenStack and CloudStack). So I decided to postpone my idea and started to write an article on this <strong>Unsung hero of Cloud Computing</strong> called libvirt <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, which I believe many people won’t have heard of. Obviously talking about software library tend to be technical, so this article will have a technical tone, but I will attempt to make it readable for everyone interested in Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualzation and these APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of Cloud Management Platform. Libvirt makes it possible to control and manage millions of compute nodes, storage and network devices via common programmable interface. Its like being able to control and orchestrate fleet of millions of car irrespective of different manufacturer, model, or engine through a common interface from a single car (it can be more then one car for redundancy and high availability). What started as a management API for Xen, today has been extended to support major components of Cloud Computing platforms.</p>
<div id="libvirt-goals-architecture">
<h2>Libvirt Goals &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>Libvirt defines following terms for its goals <a href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Mapping of libvirt terms to virtualized or containerized physical machine" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_terms_mapping.png"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong> is a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a layer of softeare allowing to virtualize a node in a set of physical machines with possible different configurations that the node itself.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> is an instance of an operating system (or subsystem in case of container virtualization like OpenVZ and lxc) running on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above terms <strong>“The goal of libvirt is to provide a common and stable layer sufficient to securely manage domains on a node, possibly remote”</strong>. So libvirt should provide all APIs needed to do the management, such as: provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate and stop the domains - within the limits of the support of the hypervisor for those operations. This implies following sub-goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API can be carried remotely though secure APIs</li>
<li>While most API will be generic in term of hypervisor or Host OS, some API may be targeted to a single virtualization environment as long as the semantic for the operations from a domain management perspective is clear</li>
<li>the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations needed to manage domains on a node, including resource provisioning and setup</li>
<li>the API will not try to provide high level virtualization policies or multi-nodes management features like load balancing, but the API should be sufficient so they can be implemented on top of libvirt</li>
<li>stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization framework</li>
<li>the node being managed may be on a different physical machine than the management program using libvirt, to this effect libvirt supports remote access, but should only do so by using secure protocols.</li>
<li>libvirt will provide APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and NUMA partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So libvirt is intended to be a building block for higher level management tools and for applications focusing on virtualization of a single node (the only exception being domain migration between node capabilities which involves more than one node).</p>
<div id="libvirt-driver-based-architecture">
<h3>Libvirt Driver Based Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt driver based architecture" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_architecture.png"></p><p>Libvirt to support wide variety of hypervisor implements a driver-based architecture. Based on car analogy, it means delegating the actual implementation of control of different cars to the drivers specifically designed for make, model and engine of the specific car. Libvirt currently supports:</p>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LXC - Linux Containers</li>
<li>OpenVZ</li>
<li>QEMU</li>
<li>Test - Used for testing</li>
<li>UML - User Mode Linux</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMware ESX</li>
<li>VMware Workstation/Player</li>
<li>Xen</li>
<li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li>
<li>IBM PowerVM (phyp)</li>
<li>Parallels</li>
<li>Remote - Accessing libvirt on remote node through libvirtd (libvirt daemon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directory backend</li>
<li>Local filesystem backend</li>
<li>Network filesystem backend</li>
<li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM) backend</li>
<li>Disk backend</li>
<li>iSCSI backend</li>
<li>SCSI backend</li>
<li>Multipath backend</li>
<li>RBD (RADOS Block Device) backend</li>
<li>Sheepdog backend</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual Networks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bridging</li>

<li>VN-LINK</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="libvirt-api-structure">
<h3>Libvirt API structure <a href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a></h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_api_structure.png"></p><p>The figure above shows the five main objects exported by the API:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>virConnectPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the connection to a hypervisor. Use one of the virConnectOpen functions to obtain connection to the hypervisor which is then used as a parameter to other connection API’s.</dd>
<dt><strong>virDomainPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one domain either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently running on that node). The function virConnectListAllDomains lists all the domains for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virNetworkPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one network either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently activated). The function virConnectListAllNetworks lists all the virtualization networks for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStorageVolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one storage volume generally used as a block device available to one of the domains. The function virStorageVolLookupByPath finds the storage volume object based on its path on the node.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStoragePoolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents a storage pool, which is a logical area used to allocate and store storage volumes. The function virConnectListAllStoragePools lists all of the virtualization storage pools on the hypervisor. The function virStoragePoolLookupByVolume finds the storage pool containing a given storage volume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These names follow C conventions, but developers of cloud computing platforms and applications do not need to use C directly, there are language bindings available for major languages. Currently libvirt API language bindings <a href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a> are available for C#, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-management-architecture">
<h3>Domain Management Architecture</h3>
<p>There are two distinct means for domain management using libvirt API.</p>
<p><strong>1. Single node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_single_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As illustrated in the figure above in this mode applications (cloud management platform i.e. CMP applications) and domains exist on the same node. In this scenario applications directly works through the libvirt api on the host operating system (os) to control and manage the local domains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_multi_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, applications (CMP applications) using libvirt API and the domains to manage or control are on separate nodes. In this mode a special domain called <strong>libvirtd</strong> (libvirt daemon) needs to run on remote nodes. The management application nodes use the nodes underlying network communicattion to communicate with remote <em>libvirtd</em> through the local libvirt using custom protocol. Actually libvirt uses Remote <a href="#f6" id="id5">[6]</a> driver for communicating with remote node and remote API calls are handled synchronously. Remote driver for libvirt supports a range of transports like:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>tls</em></dt>
<dd>TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) authenticated and encrypted TCP/IP socket, usually listening on a public port number. To use this you will need to generate client and server certificates. The standard port is 16514. This is the <strong>default</strong> transport, if no other is specified.</dd>
<dt><em>unix</em></dt>
<dd>nix domain socket. Since this is only accessible on the local machine, it is not encrypted, and uses Unix permissions or SELinux for authentication. The standard socket names are /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro (the latter for read-only connections).</dd>
<dt><em>ssh</em></dt>
<dd>Transported over an ordinary ssh (secure shell) connection. Requires Netcat (nc) installed and libvirtd should be running on the remote machine. You should use some sort of ssh key management (eg. ssh-agent) otherwise programs which use this transport will stop to ask for a password.</dd>
<dt><em>ext</em></dt>
<dd>Any external program which can make a connection to the remote machine by means outside the scope of libvirt.</dd>
<dt><em>tcp</em></dt>
<dd>nencrypted TCP/IP socket. Not recommended for production use, this is normally disabled, but an administrator can enable it for testing or use over a trusted network. The standard port is 16509.</dd>
<dt><em>libssh2</em></dt>
<dd>Transport over the SSH protocol using libssh2 instead of the OpenSSH binary. This transport uses the libvirt authentication callback for all ssh authentication calls and therefore supports keyboard-interactive authentication even with graphical management applications. As with the classic ssh transport netcat is required on the remote side.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Libvirt is one very important library on whose giant shoulders cloud computing services and platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus and numberous others are standing. Also this API enables developers and companies to build new and innovative cloud computing services or platforms and build awesome applications or services on top of it. Libvirt started in 2005 and with growing popularity of cloud computing, this project will continue to grow. But in most of the conferences, talks and papers related to Cloud Computing I did not find much coverage of libvirt, so while researching Cloud Management platform thought of writing and article on it. Kudos to all the libvirt code contributors for building a beautiful abstraction layer and making life easier for cloud computing services and platform developers. In spite of not getting as much press and coverage as …</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>

The opinions expressed in it are those of its author.)</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="695" data-original-width="695" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>
