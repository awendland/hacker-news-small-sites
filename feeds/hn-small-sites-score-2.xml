<small>2020-08-03</small><!-- RSS:2020-08-03T07:25:00Z -->
<p>I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open
    source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only
    time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly
    onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful.</p>
<p>To settle a few things. When I tweeted on this subject I only got the response that I should use vim. Thanks. Great.
    I can and do on use vim. That misses a number of points. Visual Studio Code is an immensely popular editor and
    likely the most common recommendations to new developers. The primary reason I've used Visual Studio Code is
    that it has an incredibly compelling solution for remote pairing in the form of LiveShare. I've used that for a
    while with great success mentoring, coaching and generally working with other developers of varying experience and
    editor preferences. Most programmers can handle a "normal" editor like VS Code while something like Emacs
    or Vim depends a lot more on what they've learned.</p>
<p>I also ended up enjoying the Remote series of extensions for developing effectively inside remote servers or local
    containers.</p>
<h2>These things are proprietary</h2>
<p>At some point I read a piece of license that said that LiveShare could only be used with the Visual Studio family of
    products. "Huh, that sounds weird, VS Code is open source right?"</p>
<p>Sure enough. VS Code is fully MIT. The binary distribution has a separate license to allow telemetry and protect
    Microsoft trademarks and stuff. Nothing particularly weird, I can't really get worked up about telemetry, I know
    some can. But the extensions.. These extensions are in my book core differentiators that makes VS Code compelling.
    For me it is definitely part of what pushes it beyond the much leaner Sublime (paid, closed source) I was using
    before.</p>
<p>These extensions have a license limiting them and their online service parts to only be used with the Visual Studio
    family of products. This is the <a href="https://microsoftdocs.github.io/live-share/license/eula.html" title="License for LiveShare">license for LiveShare</a> and this is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license" title="License for Remote">license for Remote</a>.</p>
<p>For me LiveShare is the most important thing. Google Docs style collaborative code editing, terminal sharing, port
    sharing and a bunch more features. I know Atom had an extension like this, I haven't checked the licensing there
    or tried it recently.</p>
<p>Remote is a very strong extension as well for anyone working on a server over SSH or in a container. It helps by
    installing extensions on the destination to allow language servers and such. I've seen it do terrible things to
    servers sometimes but it is very useful and generally works well.</p>
<p>It makes me uneasy to accept VS Code as an "open" project in any wider meaning of the word when compelling
    features are legally locked to only work inside the family of Visual Studio products. It makes me less certain that
    this isn't the Extend in Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. It also frustrates me that this prevents someone from
    building a compatible plugin for VIM or any other editor. This would be much more powerful if it could be in all the
    IntelliJs as well.</p>
<p>You'll find a repo for <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share" title="LiveShare on GitHub">LiveShare on GitHub</a> but it is only for documentation and issue tracking. There
    is no code. Same for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release" title="Remote on GitHub">Remote</a>.</p>
<h2>The entire marketplace is proprietary</h2>
<p>Some additional salt in this particular wound is that the use of the Marketplace of VS Code extensions is also
    proprietarily licensed. So all these open source developers are shoving their extensions into a competitive
    advantage for one of the world's largest tech firms. And they disallow other uses of the marketplace. Even if
    the letter of open source is followed there is none of the openness, collaborative or community essence that I think
    exemplifies open source and free software projects.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? I guess it protects from the competition. Such as the <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium" title="VS Codium">VS Codium</a> project which provides VS Code
    binaries without the proprietary parts. But also, as a consequence of this, without the Marketplace of extensions.
    There is an open source alternative called <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" title="Open VSX">Open VSX</a>, but since
    it isn't the canonical one it is missing a bunch of extensions and the big Liveshare and Remote ones are still
    not allowed.</p>
<p>This also blocks the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server" title="code-server">code-server editor</a> that
    allows running VS Code in the browser from using it which otherwise would have been perfect for me to do development
    on an iPad Pro. I can still use that but a lot of packages are not in Open VSX.</p>
<h2>What about lock-in?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is marketed with LiveShare and Remote as powerful extensions. VS Code is also marketed as open
    source. It is easy to use the editor, install the extensions and be under the impression that you are using an open
    source software suite where Microsoft simply hosts the peering service for identifying and connecting you and your
    collaborator.</p>
<p>But the peering service is not the only closed part. The extensions are not open source projects as far as I can find
    and they are licensed during distribution in a way that disallows using them with anything but Visual Studio
    products.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't sold on having an Electron-based editor to begin with but
    VS Code was substantially leaner than Atom so I've been mostly accepting it.</p>
<p>If you have good suggestions for strong collaborative development tools that are open source, please let me know at

  <p>Slow database queries are a common performance bottleneck for Ruby on Rails apps. Simplifying a complex query is often not possible due to the underlying business logic. Instead, you can extract parts of a query, cache and reuse them to improve performance. In this tutorial, I’ll describe a range of techniques on how to do it.</p>

<p>We will cover more advanced ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL topics like <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>, and query plan visualizer tool.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="when-subquery-caching-makes-sense-for-slow-activerecord-queries">When subquery caching makes sense for slow ActiveRecord queries?</h2>

<p>Subquery caching is a bit more convoluted solution for optimizing slow queries. Before you decide to implement it you should double-check if more straightforward fixes could help instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add missing database indexes and to avoid inefficient <code>Seq Scan</code> on large collections</li>
  <li>make sure that the database server is adequately scaled and has a decent cache hit rate. You can use <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/rails-pg-extras#cache_hit" target="_blank">RailsPGExtras gem</a> to validate that</li>
  <li>check if PostgreSQL configuration is correct for the type of the database server that you’re using. <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/" target="_blank">PGTune</a> is your friend here</li>
  <li>validate that your queries are not locking for too long, e.g., because of <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/rails-mistakes-downtime#detecting-deadlocks">too wide ActiveRecord transaction scope</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can read out my other blogpost for an overview of <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/slow-rails-queries">tips for optimizing slow Rails queries</a>.</p>

<p>If none of the above approaches helps, let’s discuss how you can split slow queries into the reusable parts.</p>

<h2 id="sample-database-structure">Sample database structure</h2>

<p>How to determine which part of a query to cache?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no simple answer to this question. It’s totally dependent on your application’s logic.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we will assume the following database structure to explore some common scenarios:</p>

<p><img alt="Sample PostgreSQL database structure" title="Sample PostgreSQL database strucutre" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/db-structure-for-cache-e7bbfcd8e5d7021b8291218f8b87e6d88dc4ab670a8f15885bb1c23ce57a8b11.png"></p>





<p><code>app/models/user.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:group_assignments</span><span>,</span> <span>dependent: :destroy</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:groups</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :group_assignments</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:posts</span>

<p><code>app/models/group.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>Group</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>

<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>app/models/post.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>Post</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:user</span>

    <span>{</span>
      <span>id: </span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>text: </span><span>text</span><span>,</span>
      <span>user_email: </span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span>
      <span>group_name: </span><span>group</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>app/models/group_assignment.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>GroupAssignment</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"group_assignments"</span>

  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:user</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:group</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>User</strong> can belong to many <strong>Groups</strong> with a different role via the <strong>GroupAssignment</strong> join model. <strong>Posts</strong> are published in a <strong>Group</strong> by a <strong>User</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s now explore potential slow queries that could originate in a system with similar schema.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-slow-queries">Analyzing slow queries</h2>

<p>We will focus on optimizing a single controller. It returns not approved posts that were published in groups that a current user is an admin in. It also validates if a user is an admin in at least one group.</p>

<p>A similar complexity level requiring data from four and more tables to execute a single query is common in non-trivial Rails apps.</p>

<p>We’re using <code>eager_load</code> because relation tables are used for both filter query and post’s JSON structure. It ensures that a single query will be executed to fetch and instantiate all the records eliminating N+1 issue. You can check out <a href="https://scoutapm.com/blog/activerecord-includes-vs-joins-vs-preload-vs-eager_load-when-and-where" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for more details on differences between <code>joins</code>, <code>includes</code> and <code>eager_load</code> ActiveRecord methods.</p>

<p><code>app/models/moderation_controller.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>PostsModerationController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>before_action</span> <span>:authorize_admin!</span>

    <span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span>
      <span>group: </span><span>admin_groups</span><span>,</span>
      <span>approved: </span><span>false</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>where</span><span>.</span><span>not</span><span>(</span><span>user: </span><span>current_user</span><span>)</span>

    <span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span>
      <span>"role = 'admin' and user_id = ?"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>current_user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>admin_groups</code> returns a relation object so two queries are merged together. The final query from <code>posts_to_moderate</code> method generates the following SQL:</p>

<p>I doubt you want to analyze this output line by line. I'm pasting to for reference to compare with the output after the optimization</p>


<p>You can also analyze your query using a <a href="http://tatiyants.com/pev/#/plans/new" target="_blank">visualizer tool</a>. Check out my <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/slow-rails-queries">other tutorial</a> for tips on how to do it.</p>

<p><img alt="PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE visualizer query plan" title="PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE visualizer query plan" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/visualizer-query-plan-46217140544fdf24208b6f1744776a70c530b3bd0a3e86265c172edc9c413066.png"></p>

<p>All the tests were carried out on a database seeded with ~200k objects in each table.</p>



<p>When analyzing the visualizer plans, it’s always worth noting how many <code>Join</code> operations the query performs. One way to speed up query execution is to limit the number of joins.</p>

<p>BTW all the tools mentioned above are useful if you already know which queries you want to put under the microscope. To discover the actual bottleneck queries in your application, you can use <a href="https://scoutapm.com/" target="_blank">ScoutAPM</a>. First, display the endpoints sorted by % of processing time consumed. Then you can deep dive into analyzing which action spends significant time in the database layer and precisely what queries are the most time-consuming.</p>

<p>Now that we know how to find and analyze bottleneck queries let’s learn how to split them into more performant and <em>cacheable</em> pieces.</p>



<p>The simplest extraction you can do is to fetch IDs of admin groups and reuse them for both authorization method and posts fetching. You don’t even need the actual group objects. You can read only the join model, significantly reducing the complexity. Just make sure to have all the foreign keys in place. You can read more about ensuring data integrity on the database level in <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/rails-postgresql-data-integrity">my other blog post</a>.</p>

<p><code>app/models/moderation_controller.rb</code></p>

    <span>).</span><span>pluck</span><span>(</span><span>:group_id</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This implementation will still perform two queries like the initial one, but they will be significantly less complex. Results of the query checking admin memberships are reused in posts fetching query, reducing the need for two join operations!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before I set my eyes on the Redux source code, I naively thought OOP is superior than FP(Functional Programming) as a programming paradigm. But this is not right. As we know that FP is dedicated to forming a easy to understand and clear workflow without those obscure abstracted objects and relations. It's much closer to human's procedural mode of thinking.</p><p>Now <code>React</code> has already got hooks which can handle the "states" properly event without <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a>. The demand for <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a> could be declining but its code base is still worth learning.

The return value is consistent which made the program returnings foreseeable during or after the execution.</p><p>OOP made a solid structure which defined all the attributes a data model should contain. It makes it easy to modify or configure the data model.</p><p>In <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a>, the <code>reduers</code> and <code>middlewares</code> are usually defined only once. It means, we don't need the ability to update these properties and we don't hope them to be altered during the runtime. As for FP approach, it utilizes the <code>closure</code> technique that kills the possbility of exposing the internal properties. With some fantastic FP techniques (curry, compose, pipe), it's even making the program much more human-readable than OOP.</p><p>I would say FP should be the best fit for such scenario. Of course, the FP I'm talking about here is far from the real functional programming like Haskell.

<p>  The Kassel district court found biology professor Ulrich Kutschera guilty of insulting homosexuals because of statements in an interview.  His statements are not covered by the freedom of science. </p>
</div>

<div itemprop="articleBody" data-qa="Article.Text">
<p><span>D</span>he district court in Kassel sentenced biology professor Ulrich Kutschera on Monday for insulting homosexuals.  It imposed a fine of 6,000 euros.  The court did not consider the accusation of incitement to be valid.  However, Kutschera’s statements are also not covered by the freedom of science, said the judge: “It depends on the context.” This is how the evolutionary biologist spoke in an interview and not in a lecture.  The verdict is not yet legally binding.</p>
<p>The evolutionary biologist was reported for an interview that appeared on the kath.net portal in 2017.  In it, Kutschera commented on “Marriage for All”, ie marriages between people of the same sex.  Among other things, the professor at the University of Kassel associated the right of adoption for homosexual couples with pedophilia and child abuse.  The public prosecutor accused him of attributing a fundamental tendency to sexually abuse children to homosexuals under the pretext of “life science facts”.</p><!--CusAdsVi3-->

<p>Kutschera stood by his quotes.  However, he accused critics and the public prosecutor of misinterpreting statements and taking them out of context: “The entire charge completely ignores what is said in the interview,” he said.  The prosecution failed to recognize that he referred to an experiment on gender identity in the text and that he used the term pedophilia in the sense of its author as “consensual loving acts” – delimited from child sexual abuse.  Basically, Kutschera is concerned about one thing, his lawyer said: “He is concerned about psychological problems in children from same-sex partnerships.”</p>
<p>The judge did not accept the reference to the use of technical terms: “The general public understands it as it is in general language use.”</p>
<h3>“Outrage statements by Ulrich Kutschera”</h3>
<p>This was also the view of homosexuals who acted as witnesses in court.  Among other things, a 53-year-old Berlin doctor testified before the district court, who had reported Kutschera.  He did this “because I feel that my human dignity has been violated.” With his statements, Kutschera exceeded the limits of freedom of expression and science.</p>

<p>After the trial, Kutschera’s employer, the University of Kassel, said: “Ulrich Kutschera’s statements are outrageous.” But the first-instance verdict was not yet final.  For civil servant university lecturers, the Hessian Disciplinary Act applies, according to which a possible disciplinary procedure is suspended until a legal judgment in the same matter has reached a final judgment.  A procedure for the successor of Kutschera is “on a very good way”.</p>
<p>Hesse’s Minister of Science Angela Dorn (Greens) said the ruling shows that freedom of expression works in Germany.  “It finds its limits where people and entire groups of people are insulted and disparaged.” If the judgment becomes final, the University of Kassel “as a service authority will have to check whether there are any disciplinary consequences,” said Dorn.  “I am sure that she will do this carefully.”</p>

    <p>The main options are <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/espeak">espeak</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuspeech/">Gnuspeech</a>,
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/spd-say.1.html">spd-say</a>, MBROLA, PicoTTS and the <a href="http://festvox.org/">festvox</a> project
which <a href="http://festvox.org/festival/">festival</a> and <a href="http://www.festvox.org/flite/">flite</a> are part of.
While I found espeak to be the simplest system to use, festival produced the best results when used with the right voices.
This post shall outline the various ways festival can be used and the steps required to achieve good results.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Install festival:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>festival festvox-us-slt-hts</code></pre></figure>

<p>Use festival’s interactive mode:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival <span>-i</span>
festival&gt; <span>(</span>voice.list<span>)</span>
festival&gt; <span>(</span>voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts<span>)</span> 
festival&gt; <span>(</span>SayText <span>"Don't hate me, I'm just doing my job!"</span><span>)</span>
festival&gt; <span>(</span>intro<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run commands from file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival&gt; <span>(</span>load <span>"hello.scm"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Use festival’s batch mode:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival <span>-b</span> <span>'(voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts)'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>'(SayText "The temperature is 22 degrees centigrade and there is a slight breeze from the west.")'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Use festival’s batch mode to run file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival <span>-b</span> hello.scm</code></pre></figure>

<p>Pipe text into festival’s tts mode:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span>hello | festival <span>--tts</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Pipe text to festival’s tts mode from Python with subprocess:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>subprocess</span> <span>import</span> <span>PIPE</span><span>,</span> <span>Popen</span>
<span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>'We love Raspberry.'</span>
<span>process</span> <span>=</span> <span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'festival'</span><span>,</span> <span>'--tts'</span><span>],</span> <span>stdin</span><span>=</span><span>PIPE</span><span>)</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>wait</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Use Python wrapper of festival’s C++ API:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>festival-dev
pip <span>install </span>git+https://github.com/krisfris/pyfestival</code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>festival</span>
<span>festival</span><span>.</span><span>sayText</span><span>(</span><span>'hello'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Festival also has a C, C++ and a client-server API. See <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/festival_28.html#SEC126">API</a>.</p>

<h3 id="voices">Voices</h3>

<p>The <code>voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts</code> voice (used above) can be installed easily and isn’t bad but
the Nitech HTS voices are better. HTS stands for <em>hidden-markov-model-based speech synthesis system</em> and Nitech is the Nagoya Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>The voices were not available on the original site at the time of writing this post thus I uploaded them to a GitHub repository.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Clone the github repo with the voices</span>
git clone git@github.com:krisfris/nitech-hts-voices.git

<span># Enter directory</span>
<span>cd </span>nitech-hts-voices

<span># Extract  files</span>
<span>for </span>t <span>in</span> <span>`</span><span>ls</span><span>`</span> <span>;</span> <span>do </span><span>tar </span>xvf <span>$t</span> <span>;</span> <span>done</span>

<span># Install voices</span>
<span>sudo mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /usr/share/festival/voices/us
<span>sudo mv </span>lib/voices/us/<span>*</span> /usr/share/festival/voices/us/
<span>sudo mv </span>lib/hts.scm /usr/share/festival/hts.scm

<span># List all available voices</span>
<span>for </span>d <span>in</span> <span>`</span><span>ls</span> /usr/share/festival/voices<span>`</span> <span>;</span> <span>do </span><span>ls</span> <span>"/usr/share/festival/voices/</span><span>${</span><span>d</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>;</span> <span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To set a voice as default voice edit the <code>/etc/festival.scm</code> file and add the following line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span><span>set</span><span>!</span> voice_default <span>'voice_nitech_us_rms_arctic_hts)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Note:</em> The Nitech voices are not compatible with festival versions greater than 2.1 which is from 2010. The default festival version on Ubuntu 20.04 is 2.5.</p>

<h3 id="flite">Flite</h3>

<p>Flite is a small, fast and more portable (albeit less customizable) speech synthesis engine for festival voices.
Install it with <code>sudo apt install flite</code>. Download more voices:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd
mkdir</span> .config/flite <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> .config/flite
wget <span>-r</span> <span>--no-parent</span> <span>--no-directories</span> <span>--accept</span> flitevox http://www.festvox.org/flite/packed/flite-2.0/voices/
<span>echo</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span> | flite <span>-voice</span> ./cmu_us_axb.flitevox</code></pre></figure>

<p>The downside is, you can’t use voices from festival with flite directly.
Instead you will need to convert them manually which requires time and programming knowledge.
See <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/flite_8.html">Converting FestVox Voices</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I would stick to festival unless the speed and small size of flite are
actually required.</p>

<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>

<p>The festival manual mentions a simple way of using festival from emacs.
See <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/festival_11.html#SEC37">Emacs interface</a>.</p>

<p>There is also an ubuntu package called <code>eflite</code> which is an emacspeak server based on flite.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Since the Nitech voices don’t work with newer festival versions you will have to settle for 
the <code>cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts</code> voice. If you don’t mind going commercial,
using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">AWS Polly</a> is likely a better choice.

<p><strong><u>A Money Mystery</u></strong></p>



<p>I have been unemployed for 10 months now and my net worth is greater today than it was when I quit my job. The purpose of this piece is to explain how that has happened.</p>



<p>First, I want to be clear about a few ways in which I did not make money. I did not receive any government money through unemployment nor from the stimulus checks. Unemployment money is not for people who quit their jobs voluntarily and the stimulus checks were not for people who made more than $99,000 in 2019. I have not had any paid job at any point in the last 10 months. I did not start a profitable business at any point during that time. I have not made any money from this blog. My only material source of income has been through the appreciation of investments that I have made on my own, but that is not the part the matters most.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Water Bucket Analogy</u></strong></p>



<p>What matters most is how I have kept from losing money.</p>



<p>To explain, let me introduce a simple analogy. Think about a bucket of water with a hose that fills it and a hole near the bottom where the water leaks out. The water in the bucket represents your money and the speed at which it leaks out of the hole is the speed at which your money is spent. Most people have a paying job. That’s the hose.</p>



<p>People want to increase their net worth over time and so naturally they think about how they can get more water faster from the hose. The better place to start, however, is to focus on limiting the leakage. People’s general focus on the hose rather than the hole is well demonstrated by the fact that anyone you ask will be able to tell you how much money they make by some unit of time but almost no one will be able to tell you the same in terms of their costs. They probably know the cost of their rent or mortgage payments and a number of other standalone expenses (by varying units of time) but very few will be able to tell you how much money they spend on an average day including their monthly, annual, and other periodic expenses spread out over the course of the respective period. I certainly could not have answered that question myself a year ago but doing so seemed like the sensible place to start.</p>



<p><strong><u>Base Burn Rate</u></strong></p>



<p>I knew when I quit my job in banking that in order to keep my cash burn in check I would need to get my expenses in order. I had turned the hose off so I needed to manage the hole. I started with my subscriptions (monthly and annual payments). I looked at the recurring expenses on my credit card and bank statements. I cancelled almost all of them. I had to add one significant one, health insurance, which my employer had been paying previously. I went with the second cheapest plan I could find from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield for $287/month. Next time I would instead go with the second cheapest plan from Oscar for $293/month because I like newer companies in broken industries and they tend to offer a better customer experience.</p>



<p>My next largest recurring payment was my phone bill. I went into the Verizon store and asked what the differences were between my current plan and the cheapest one I could possibly have. The only difference of any significance was the inability with the lower plan to use a hotspot. That infrequently used function was not nearly worth the ~$80/month difference in plans. I cut my phone bill in half to $78/month.</p>



<p>Below are the rest of my monthly and annual expenses as they stand today. As you will see, if I didn’t actively spend any money, these passive expenses alone would result in only a $15/day average burn. I call this my <strong><em>base burn rate</em></strong>. <em>Note: this figure was closer to $60 when I was living in New York pre-covid (+ rent, WiFi, utilities) and between $30-$60 when I was traveling in Europe and Asia (+ hostels/Airbnbs), but right now I am fortunate to be living with my family for free</em>.</p>

<p>Not bad right? It gets better…</p>



<p><strong><u>Passive Income</u></strong></p>



<p>I think about my investments in terms of three categories – crypto, stocks, and real estate. Real estate is unique among the three in that it pretty predictably generates cash flows each month. This is because our monthly rents collected from tenants are more than enough to cover the monthly mortgage payments, the cost of our property manager (10% of rent), and any necessary maintenance and/or repairs that she facilitates on our behalf over the course of a given month. Subtracting those expenses from the total rent collected each month and splitting the balance with my good friend and co-owner Kyle leaves me to expect $319/month (assuming the average amount of monthly repairs) which comes out to about $10/day. This is a far cry from the passive income of a real estate magnate but it is solid for a first property and not insignificant for me when it is the only dependable income that I have. Most importantly, this passive income offsets two-thirds of my base burn rate at the moment.</p>



<p>With my base burn rate and passive income figured out, I can calculate what I call my <strong><em>net base burn rate</em></strong> which in this case is equal to $5/day,</p>



<p><strong><u>3 Basic Principles</u></strong></p>



<p>After minimizing my base burn rate and estimating my passive income to calculate my net base burn rate, the next category I considered was comprised of the regularly re-occurring but variable expenses that cost me the most. This includes food, drinks, transportation, and entertainment. I came up with a few principles to help myself spend less in these areas. That said, I believe one of the best things money can buy is the ability not to have to worry about money so rather than force any hard rules upon myself I mostly just keep these principles in mind and try to be reasonable most of the time. <em>Note: these principles were most applicable when I was traveling and then living in New York pre-covid.</em></p>



<ol type="1"><li>Food – don’t drink a lot at restaurants. You are there for the food and the company.</li><li>Drinks – drink less and mostly at yours or friends’ places. The lower your tolerance, the cheaper the fun.</li><li>Transportation – walk when you can. Subways are usually quicker and always cheaper than cars.</li></ol>



<p><strong><u>Exceeding Expectations</u></strong></p>



<p>The goal is not to be watching your wallet all the time. It is to figure it out, then forget about it. Knowing my net base burn rate of $5/day leads to an annual burn of less than $2,000 allows me to live and spend confidently because I know if I ever want to slow my burn I can basically do so simply by doing nothing (therefore slowing my active spending). I don’t <em>need</em> to drink alcohol or go golfing and I could easily eat for a few dollars per day if I was willing to eat less healthfully and not go out for a while. Fortunately, I have not had to sacrifice any of these things. If I did have to, I know that I could, but I would probably just go and get a job at that point and realistically well before that point ever came.</p>



<p>In order to quit my job in the first place, I had to be willing to endure some level of burn in exchange for the freedom of time that I was buying for myself. I was confident that I could offset some of it with my investments in crypto and stocks, and the non- cash flow part of my real estate investment (the appreciation of the value of my equity in the property). Never would I have anticipated what has happened to date. I am pleased to say that between Bitcoin’s surge this week, Amazon’s last month, the appreciation of my Kentucky property’s value, and some other smaller stock and crypto investments along the way, my investments have now offset the entirety of my burn over the last 10 months. My net worth is slightly greater today than it was the day I quit my job, and it is not because I’ve been a hermit or lived a miserably frugal life. Quite the contrary. I traveled the world for a few months, had a four-month lease in New York City and stayed in a couple hotels before that, got a month-long Airbnb in Georgia with Lauren, have eaten well, been golfing a lot lately, and the list goes on. Not every day is roses. I would be skeptical of anyone who says that is the case. But I have not often if ever but rarely felt restrained moneywise. I have been enjoying my time quite a bit.</p>



<p>When I quit my job, I figured I would burn a good chunk of my savings in a few months and expected I would feel the need to get a job after several if not before then. I thought it would be well worthwhile to burn that money in exchange for the time that I would buy for myself to do whatever I wanted. I was right in the sense that this time has proven valuable to me but wrong in another. It hasn’t cost me a dime.</p>

    <p>As most reasonable people are familiar with the Harry Potter books,
their content serves as ideal material for building a mnemonic system.
The mnemonic major system, in particular, is used to memorize number sequences.</p>

<p>In order to implement the steps outlined in this post you need the content of the Harry Potter books (or other book(s) if you prefer).
In a previous post I showed you how to
<a href="https://darkshadow.io/2020/06/29/building-a-fantasy-book-db.html">download fantasy books and extract their text</a>.
Among the downloaded data were the Harry Potter books which I will use in this post.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-learn-the-sound-number-mapping">Step 1: Learn the sound-number mapping</h3>

<p>In the mnemonic major system each number from 0 to 9 is associated with one or more
consonant sounds. Use the following table as a reference.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number</th>
      <th>Sounds (IPA)</th>
      <th>Letters with example words</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>s, z</td>
      <td>s (see), c (city), z (zero), x (xylophone)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>

<p>In English, letters are pronounced in different ways depending on the context,
that’s why some letters are repeated in different rows. But in the end,
only the sound matters, not the spelling.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples for words, their IPA representation and the number they encode.</p>

<p>I’m going to show you how to write a training program to internalize
the concept of mapping sounds to numbers in Step 4. But first, you need the ability
to convert text automatically to numbers. This happens in 2 steps. First, the text is converted
to IPA. Then, the IPA is converted to numbers.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-converting-ipa-to-numbers">Step 2: Converting IPA to numbers</h3>

<p>The process of converting IPA to numbers is very simple. I iterate through the IPA chars
and if there is a number associated with the char I append the number to the result.</p>

<p>For example, <code>major_decode_from_ipa('dɪfəkəlt')</code> yields <code>[1, 8, 7, 5, 1]</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I define a couple functions for converting number sequences to and from strings.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>numseq_to_str</span><span>(</span><span>numseq</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Convert number sequence to string."""</span>

<span>def</span> <span>str_to_numseq</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Convert string to number sequence."""</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>s</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>isdigit</span><span>()]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For example, <code>numseq_to_str([1, 8, 7, 5, 1])</code> yields <code>'18751'</code>.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-converting-text-to-ipa">Step 3: Converting text to IPA</h3>

<p>In order to automatically convert text to IPA (and then to numbers) you need to use an IPA
dictionary.</p>

<p>Python’s <a href="https://pypi.org/project/eng-to-ipa/">eng-to-ipa</a> package is able to convert text to
IPA using the <em>Carnegie-Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary</em>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>eng_to_ipa</span>

<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>'“I’ll bring up some sandwiches.”'</span>  <span># Sentence from the HP books

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>ipa</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This yields:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">['“i’ll* brɪŋ əp səm sandwiches.”*']</code></pre></figure>

<p>According to the docs, eng-to-ipa will reprint words that cannot be found in the CMU dictionary
with an asterisk. Thus, <code>“i’ll</code> and <code>sandwiches.”</code> have not been found. Clearly, the punctuation is the issue.
I preprocess the text in order to ease the conversion to IPA.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Punctuation including unicode chars

<p>As you can see, there are 3 ways to pronounce this sentence depending on whether you like
to pronounce <code>sandwich</code> with <code>m</code>, <code>n</code> or <code>nd</code>. In order to use the major system effectively,
you should use the version that sounds most natural to you.</p>

<p>Let’s look at another example.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eng_to_ipa</span><span>(</span><span>preprocess</span><span>(</span><span>'Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!'</span><span>),</span> <span>retrieve_all</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">['wɛl ɪf jur ʃʊr bɛtər bi gryffindor*', 'wɛl ɪf jʊr ʃʊr bɛtər bi gryffindor*']</code></pre></figure>

<p>The word <code>gryffindor</code> was not found in the CMU dictionary, which can be expected.
After a quick search for the word’s pronunciation I found <a href="https://youglish.com/pronounce/gryffindor/english">YouGlish</a>
which uses YouTube videos to find IPAs. While their API is not free, a limited number of IPA’s can be scraped
for our purpose.</p>

<p>As you can see, this function is semi-interactive. Without user intervention it will
get stuck on a CAPTCHA. Even then, you’ll eventually reach their daily usage limit
and won’t be able to continue. For our purpose this shall be good enough though.</p>

<p>I have shown that for many words there are several possible pronunciations, from which you need to choose
your preferred one, and that some words are not in the CMU dictionary and
require scraping the IPA from another source or are not available at all.
For these 2 reasons, you will need to build your own personal IPA dictionary.</p>

<p>I’m going to build my IPA dictionary by iterating through the words of the Harry Potter books
and adding each word and the corresponding IPA to my dictionary.</p>

<p>First, I define
some functions for managing my dictionary (a simple JSON file in this case).</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>os</span><span>,</span> <span>glob</span><span>,</span> <span>json</span>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Feedback loops are so important. (If you’re not sure what that is, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603580557">“Thinking in Systems”</a>.) </p>



<p>These loops help systems improve. If you don’t have feedback, you’ll improve more slowly, in my experience. Why? Because you won’t know what you are doing that is good and what is garbage. It’s really hard to evaluate that kind of stuff yourself. You can do it, it just takes time and perspective.</p>



<p>And of course, you want to do more of what is good. Here are some kinds of feedback loops which have helped me.</p>



<ul><li>tests</li><li>one to ones</li><li>public writing</li><li>being a contractor</li></ul>



<p>Automated tests are a really tight feedback loop. You can make changes to code and know if you’ve blown things up. (Type systems are another tight feedback loop preferred by some.) This is helpful in many situations, including when you are <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/01/20/on-debugging/">debugging a problem</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/03/16/how-to-manage-one-to-ones/">One to ones</a> are a great way to gather feedback from your manager on problems, challenges and situations that you have faced. By doing it in a one to one (rather than a one off meeting), you’ll build context and history around these. After all, the tenth time you bring up the fact you find front-end development challenging indicates that this is a pattern, and you should evolve yourself or the position to help with the challenge. When you have your meeting, make sure you ask for feedback explicitly. When you get it, avoid being defensive. If you make it hard to get feedback, you’ll get less.</p>



<p>Public writing, especially <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/12/10/start-a-blog/">a blog</a>, is a great way to get feedback. You’ll be able to put your thoughts out in public. This can be scary and frustrating; some communities are more gentle about feedback than others. But the act of writing forces you to make the implicit explicit. And sharing that knowledge is a great way to get feedback. (Even a lack of response is feedback; what you were writing didn’t resonated with the audience you shared it with.)</p>



<p>I think everyone should <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/11/12/try-contracting/">try being a contractor</a>. First it makes you appreciative of everyone else in a business, because when you are contracting, you often have to take on roles outside of development (sales, accounting, marketing). But for the purposes of this post, contracting is a great way to get feedback from the market. You’ll learn about which skills are in demand and what organizations will pay for those skills. Of course, you can find this out as an employee, but if you are a contractor, especially a short term one, you’ll be interacting with possible hiring managers much more often than as an employee. And the feedback loop is brutal and blunt: do they hire you or not. </p>



<p>Feedback loops are a key way to find out whether what you are doing is working or not. Seek them out. </p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

<p>The modern age of computers is amazing to me. In a few mere minutes we can spin up a seemingly unlimited number of virtual servers on any one of the hundreds of cloud providers out there around the world.</p>
<p>With all of this added ability of compute power we also increase our ability to distribute our HTTP requests over a larger and larger pool of networks. I came across this awesome project on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/proxycannon/proxycannon-ng">proxycannon-ng</a>.</p>
<p>It started as a hackathon project and has since seemingly halted development, however we can still use their code to spin up a network of computers to proxy our requests through!</p>
<p>They provide a nice diagram to explain what we’re making here. For our examples we’ll only be using AWS but the concept is the same across the board.</p>

		<blockquote>
  <p><em>Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth. —Oscar Wilde</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For fun over the past few weeks I’ve been working on a little project that I’m launching today. It’s called <a href="https://club.sometimesright.com/">Club P.</a> and it’s an anonymous and ephemeral discussion board like 4chan, but membership-based. So why did I make this?</p>

<p>Like many people, I’m increasingly frustrated with social media. Speech policing and growing pressure to conformity are leading me and many others to retreat to what Venkatesh Rao calls the <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">cozyweb</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike the main public internet, which runs on the (human) protocol of “users” clicking on links on public pages/apps maintained by “publishers”, the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot. It lives in a high-gatekeeping slum-like space comprising slacks, messaging apps, private groups, storage services like dropbox, and of course, email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kickstarter founder Yancey Strickler talks about a “<a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1">dark forest theory of the internet</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.</p>

  <p>This very piece is an example of this. This theory was first shared on a private channel sent to 500 people who I know or who have explicitly chosen to receive it. This is the online environment in which I feel most secure. Where I can be my most “real self.”<br>
…<br>
Dark forests like newsletters and podcasts are growing areas of activity. As are other dark forests, like Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, WeChat, and on and on. This is where Facebook is pivoting with Groups (and trying to redefine what the word “privacy” means in the process).</p>

  <p>These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments. The cultures of those spaces have more in common with the physical world than the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the reaction? There are many reasons, but here’s what I think about.</p>

<p>On social media platforms like Twitter, users have a persistent identity (even if, rarely, it is a pseudonym). This fosters completely natural incentives for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Animal-Science-Evolutionary-Psychology/dp/0679763996/">status competition</a>, but those incentives are unnaturally exacerbated by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy-ebook/dp/B07DBRBP7G/">gamification</a> inherent in likes, retweets, and follower counts. Additionally, your view on the world is limited by the set of people you have chosen to follow, as well as how a platform’s algorithm has chosen to present their messages. The result is conversation that is often performative and susceptible to groupthink and tribalism.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Show me a writer's audience, and I'll show you their opinions.</p>— Antonio García Martínez (@antoniogm) <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/1288156495947821056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>An interesting alternative mode of online conversation that is still public, and not cloistered, is that of anonymous “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboards</a>” made (in)famous by 4chan. They are web discussion forums with no user registration and no identities tied to posts. Postings are also ephemeral and are erased after a short time. Thanks to this architecture, imageboards foster a very different kind of conversation. Because there are no usernames, no follower counts, and no likes or retweets, there is no ego or status-seeking tied to users’ expressions. Because user content is presented chronologically, and neither you nor an algorithm curate what you see, you’re exposed to a greater set of expressions. Without identity everyone’s expression is on equal footing and can be judged on its own merits regardless of its authorship.</p>

<p>Such a peculiar arrangement can engender unreserved contributions to group creativity, which is why the origins of so much of what we take for granted as “internet culture” today—from lolcats to rickrolling—can be traced back to 4chan. As Hao Li has <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/anonymity-internet-4chan-277953">put it</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anonymity frees individuals from the burden of the ego, which is afraid of judgment, wants recognition, and acts defensively towards disagreements from others.  In a collaborative environment, it blocks creativity and distorts incentives. When the ego is removed, unfiltered and raw truth comes out. … Once the ego is gone, anonymous individuals identify with an amorphous entity that transcends individuality. It’s not that online anonymity leads to groupthink; it actually encourages creativity and non-conformity. Instead, anonymity brings individuals closer through cutting the personal prejudices and allegiances that divide them apart in real life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, as 4chan itself shows, anonymity can have a very dark side. Without identity there is no accountability, and without account registration there is no way to screen out trolls and troublemakers. So, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about how we might be able to get the good of an anonymous discussion forum without so much of the bad. What I’ve come up with is <a href="https://club.sometimesright.com/">Club P.</a> and I’m launching it today.</p>

<p>Club P. is essentially an anonymous discussion forum but with important differences compared to traditional imageboards. Most significantly, you have to be a member to post, and membership costs $2 per month. That’s a modest amount that after hosting and service fees should leave me no profit, but it will be a barrier to entry that I hope will screen in earnest folks. Membership means that, unlike completely anonymous forums, users do have to create an account, which will help with moderation. No identifying information will ever be presented on the site—no username, nor email address, nothing. On the backend, however, users are assigned a unique alphanumeric ID (like 5f20bwcd1f516020410b8e9) and their posts are associated with that ID so that, if I had to do it, I could ban the author of a particular post without ever knowing their name.</p>

<p>The functionality of the site is very simple. On the homepage is a listing of all threads posted in the last 48 hours. After 48 hours threads are deleted, so all conversations are ephemeral. (I would like to eventually bring that down to 24 hours or less.) Anyone can read the threads, but only logged-in members can start new threads and post replies to existing threads. Search engines are directed not to index the site, so posts should not show up in search results.</p>

<p>The design of the site is heavily influenced by Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood’s thinking on forum architecture. Threads are <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/web-discussions-flat-by-design/">flat rather than presented in a tree structure</a>. If a link to a thread is blue on the homepage, then either you haven’t visited it or there is a new reply post you haven’t seen. Once you’re logged in, posting new threads and replying to existing ones is effortless. Messages (both initial posts and replies) are limited to 2,020 characters in honor of this exceptional year.</p>

<p>I also plan to crib from Spolsky’s <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/03/03/building-communities-with-software/">moderating philosophy</a>, which means I don’t have to post a list of content rules because we all have a good sense of what’s clearly in-bounds and what’s not. As Spolsky says, “posting rules is just a way to insult the majority of the law-abiding citizens and it doesn’t deter the morons who think their own poo smells delicious and nothing they post could possibly be against the rules.” Things will get deleted when they have to be and users will be kicked out when necessary, but I hope we can avoid that, and I think the fact we’ll all be members of a club will help.</p>

<p>One frequent question from beta testers was, <strong>“How is this anonymous if you have my email and credit card info?”</strong> The answer is that it’s not. It’s an anonymous discussion forum in the sense that users posting in the forum will be anonymous to everyone reading those posts. But yes, unlike 4chan, you do have to create an account with personal info to use the site, so in that way it’s not completely anonymous … which is kinda the point! In the end, though, I will have no more info about you than Jack does if you have a pseudonymous Twitter account. In fact, I will have less info because I do not collect your name, only the email address you use at sign-up (feel free to use a throwaway), and your credit card info stays with Stripe and I never see it.</p>

<p>Finally, let me say this is just an experiment to see if we can get the benefits of anonymous forums with less of the downsides. It’s a fun hobby project for me and that’s it. I reserve the right to change the variables described above and to shut the whole thing down if it doesn’t work out, but I hope it does. And I welcome you to join me in this experiment. <a href="https://club.sometimesright.com/#/ms/signup/5f177770a57015000438bdea">Sign up now.</a></p>

The results of three studies show a minimum increase of 119.25% and a maximum increase of 304.88%.<br></p></li><li><p>Attractiveness had little to no effect on a judge’s verdict of guilt. Attractive and unattractive criminals were convicted equally.<br></p></li><li><p>Mock jurors generally sentenced unattractive criminals significantly higher than attractive criminals. However, as jurors do not determine sentencing in real court cases, these results are not directly applicable.<br></p></li><li><p>Attractiveness had minor effects on mock juror’s verdicts. Some studies reported minor effects and some studies reported no effects.<br></p></li><li><p>Generally, attractive people are perceived as more intelligent, more socially skilled, more appealing personalities, more moral, more altruistic, more likely to succeed, more hirable as managers, and more competent. Attractive people tend to have better physical health, better mental health, better dating experiences, earn more money, obtain higher career positions, chosen for jobs more often, promoted more often, receive better job evaluations, and chosen as business partners more often, than unattractive people.<br></p></li><li><p>I believe that the attractiveness bias is rarely conscious. I do not think people are consciously disfavouring unattractive people. I also do not place moral blame on the typical person for their unconscious bias.</p></li></ol><p>* * *</p><h2><strong>REAL JUDGES: SENTENCING</strong></h2><p><strong>THE MISDEMEANOUR STUDY </strong><em>[1]</em></p><p>The first study we will observe is the research conducted by Downs and Lyons.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to find a link between a criminal’s attractiveness and sentencing outcomes.</p><p>They gathered a group of police officers and students to rate the attractiveness of over 2000 criminals. A scale of 1 - 5 was used and their ratings were mostly similar.</p><p>Then, the judges sentencing decisions were divided into two main categories: misdemeanors and felonies. Misdemeanors were separated into to 3 classes, related to the severity of the crime.</p><p><em>The Results &amp; Key Takeaways</em></p><p>For misdemeanours, the judges fined unattractive criminals significantly more than attractive criminals. The fine incrementally increased as the attractiveness decreased.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minor Misdemeanours = +224.87%</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderate Misdemeanours = +304.88%</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious Misdemeanours = + 174.78%</p><p>The results are graphed below.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_6_1489459079955_48500"><div>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>It’s possible to build some pretty nifty applications without having a good understanding of how the code is working. You copy and paste some online examples here, you try random things until one of them works there, and eventually you’ve got a sort of copy-pasted Rube Goldberg machine that basically works even if you’re not entirely sure how.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, something is going to go wrong that cannot be fixed without a decent understanding of what’s going on under the hood. And when that does happen it is scary and stressful and not at all the best time to discover that the plumbing of your code is a deep, impenetrable mystery.</p>
<p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1596486778/372/" alt="dialog box that says error, please contact support"></p>
<p>Getting practice understanding your code and fixing problems with it before things like that happen can be incredibly helpful. Unfortunately, the only way to get practice fixing broken code is for your code to break, and broken code doesn’t happen when it’s convenient and you’d like some practice.</p>
<p>Although I think most coding schools have debugging exercises here and there, I have spent a lot of time wishing that we had some better ways to give students more regular practice with debugging.</p>
<p>Recently, I finally got a chance to take the time to sit down and write a tool for debugging practice that I’ve been thinking about making for a while to solve this exact problem.</p>
<h2>Introducing debug_trainer!</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/debug_trainer"><code>debug_trainer</code></a> is a terminal program that breaks your code! Run the <code>break</code> command on a file of your choice and it will introduce a random breaking change into that file (or several changes if you’re feeling adventurous). Then you, the programmer, can put your debugging skills to work and try to find the change that was made.</p>
<p>Let's say you've got a file, <code>my_file.py</code>, that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, "</span> <span>+</span> <span>name</span> <span>+</span> <span>"!"</span><span>)</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"Stacey"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You'd run <code>debug_trainer</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; debug_trainer break my_file.py 


Breaking my_file.py...


...done!


Good luck debugging! I believe in you! Don't forget to make your program print things out if you don't know what they are. ❤️
</code></pre><p>And it might, for example, change the file to this (see the error?):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>greet</span><span>():</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, "</span> <span>+</span> <span>name</span> <span>+</span> <span>"!"</span><span>)</span>

<span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>"Stacey"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The changes it can make are all based on common issues I’ve seen students struggle with. It might change the first letter of a variable name from capital to lowercase. It might remove the word ”return” from a return statement in a function. It might rearrange or remove the arguments in a function declaration. Malevolent!</p>
<p>If you get stuck, you can ask <code>debug_trainer</code> to give you some hints with the <code>error-type-hint</code> and <code>line-hint</code> commands. <code>error-type-hint</code> will tell you what kind of change it made (for example, “somewhere in this file, <code>debug_trainer</code> changed the arguments to a function”). <code>line-hint</code> will tell you what line the change was made on. If you get really stuck, you can have it tell you exactly what it did with the <code>explain</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; debug_trainer error-type-hint my_file.py

HINT: somewhere in this file, debug_trainer changed the arguments to a function.
</code></pre><pre><code>&gt; debug_trainer line-hint my_file.py

HINT: The line where the change was made was line 1 of the original file.
</code></pre><pre><code>&gt; debug_trainer explain my_file.py

removed the name argument from greet on line 1 of the original file
</code></pre><p>And once you’re done, whatever file <code>debug_trainer</code> changed, you can reset it back to it’s working state with the <code>reset</code> command. Then you can do the same thing all over again as many times as you want!</p>
<pre><code>&gt; debug_trainer reset my_file.py

my_file.py has been reset!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <p dir="ltr">GPT-3, the most powerful language model to date, has been all the rage in the tech industry lately. If you don’t know much about it, here are two pretty good pieces that explain: Azeem Azhar’s <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/p/a-short-history-of-knowledge-technologies">Exponential View newsletter </a>(which also goes into the history of “knowledge technologies”) and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">MIT Technology Review.</a></p>

<p>As expected, many newsletters have been discussing GPT-3 too--&nbsp;and <strong><span>we thought it would be fun to give GPT-3 the opportunity to review them back.</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 dir="ltr">Here’s what GPT-3 had to say:</h2>

<p dir="ltr">(Note: Each one has a <em>title </em>for the review and then the review itself.)</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/future-of-finance.html">The Fintech Blueprint</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The future of fintech is here and it’s better than you think</em></p>

<p>Who doesn't want more blockchain in their inbox? The Fintech Blueprint is a daily, blockchain-focused newsletter that picks out only the best stories on the burgeoning industry. With rising coin prices, hacks, ICOs, and so many other stories, the Fintech news is never ending. Keep up with the best in one spot, without the clutter.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/import-ai.html">Import AI</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>It's like an AI, but it isn't really. It just tells you what to do and how to think all day long.</em></p>

<p>Since I work at a company in the field of artificial intelligence, I try to follow what's going on in the field. This typically means going to a lot of conferences, reading tons of papers, and keeping up with research coming out. There's no real way to do this but to just put in the time. That being said, I usually don't have the energy to do this until I've woken up, so I rely on newsletters and Import AI is probably my most looked forward to in the morning. It's usually the most accurate and well-written.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/moontower-by-kris-abdelmessih.html">Moontower</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em></p>

<p>Moontower is a daily or weekly (you can set your preferences) curated newsletter of the top tech news. It takes a simple, no-nonsense approach to the news and it has some fantastic content. What I really love about it is the content is far less "clickbait-y" than most tech newsletters. Clickbait tends to get old and any decent reader can see right through it. Moontower has quality content that is always interesting and I look forward to receiving it daily.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/minutes.html">Minutes</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>It's Not Going to Change Your Life, But You Might Enjoy Reading It Anyway.</em></p>

<p>minutes is a newsletter created by Eyeo, the company that makes AdBlock. I get why you might be skeptical of them given that they're not a "traditional news outlet". However, when I learned that they only make the product because advertising dampens the experience of using the internet to an alarming degree, it won me over. Using their own product, I have to say minutes creates a great newsletter. They link out to a variety of different articles, all of which are relevant to web-dev/technology in one way or another. I always feel like I'm staying up-to-date with the latest news in the space.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/marketing-bs-with-edward-nevraumont.html">Marketing BS with Edward Nevraumont</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>A guide To The Most Common Marketing Myths And How They're All Wrong!</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">As a CMO and working on my MBA, I can appreciate the value that 'Marketing BS' brings to the table. It is chock full of great information that is delivered in an organized and useful format that has, on many occasions, provided me with insight and ideas that I wouldn't have thought of on my own. Sometimes it even gets me thinking about things in ways I never had before. I believe that 'Marketing BS' is an invaluable resource that has already paid for itself and then some. Thanks!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/desk-of-tobias-van-schneider.html">Desk of Tobias van Schneider</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Tobias' Desk is a Good Place to Start Your Day, and It's Not Even in New York City!</em></p>

<p>I have been a regular reader of the Desk of Tobias Van Schneider for several years. Before that, I used to watch his newsletter's author's YouTube Channel, which he hasn't done in a while but is still up. I absolutely love the humor, wit and depth of his writing. He offers so much advice that is very helpful for me as a creative marketer at a tech company. He's provided super-useful career advice, lessons learned in his own journey, and other insights that are just great for anyone with a creative bone in their body.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/operators-and-delians-ramblings.html">Operators &amp; Delian's Reamblings</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Operator's Guide to Delian's Ramblings.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Operators Delian's Ramblings, written by Delian Smarts, is a curation of some of the greatest recent writing on the net. The newsletters I was subscribed to were all niche and highly technical. Delian's Reamblings is an absolute breath of fresh air in that regard, and the absolute best part about it? It's weekly! Delian's choices have always been super high quality, and I look forward to it every week.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/data-science-weekly.html">Data Science Weekly</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Future is Data Science Weekly</em></p>

<p>DSW is a weekly must-read. There is a lot going on in the world of data science, and staying up to date and knowing what's important is really tough. The DSW newsletter does that for you! They link to all the latest articles from around the web, and filter out all the noise.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most Importantly... it's fun! I look forward to it every week.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/maker-mind-by-anne-laure-le-cunuff.html">Maker Mind</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Future is Here, and It's Going to Be Awesome.</em></p>

<p>I read as many news letters as I can when it comes to self-improvement and personal development. I think it's one of the most important things a human being can endeavor to do. I'm actually subscribed to dozens of them. Many are great. This one is the best. Of all of them, this is the one I can't do without and look forward to every week. Great stuff!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/the-nutgraf.html">The Nutgraf</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Nutrition For The Masses</em></p>

<p>I love this one. It's simple, easy to digest, and always has important information that I never knew. The world of business is pretty complex and overwhelming, but they have a great way of explaining it. It's too bad I only found out about this one AFTER I had already started my own company! For all those future entrepreneurs out there, start reading this one as soon as you can!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/axios-science.html">Axios Science</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Future of Journalism is…</em></p>

<p>There are several science-based newsletters, and they're all great, but Axios Science just gives you the news straight up. No weird metaphors or crazy scientists behaving eccentrically. Some days it's the most exciting thing I read all week, other days it's just a good way to get a non-partisan understanding of where the science field is at.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/mikes-newsletter-by-mike-lewis.html">Mike's Newsletter</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>It's Mikey And He Has Great Taste</em></p>

<p>Mike's Newsletter is the source for an ever-constant source of quirky and fascinating stories about the world around us. I've learned about everything from Native American role-reversals with Christian missionaries, to random facts about the far reaches of space. No matter what area you're interested in, Mike can probably make it interesting.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/exponential-view.html">Exponential view</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet.</em></p>

<p>A few months ago I was ranting on Facebook about singularity and how I hate the fact that people aren't writing about it enough. One of my friends suggested this newsletter by Azeem Azhar, and while it's not singularity focused, it is focused on exponential technology and all that entails. I'm about 3 months in and absolutely loving the newsletter. Every edition has a theme and mixes commentary with article snippets that are linked to for further reading. It really is great stuff and an enjoyable read!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/the-weekly-chartr.html">Chartr</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>It's not really that bad.</em></p>

<p>The best way to stay informed is by consuming all news all the time. The problem is, you'll get burned out by being overwhelmed by constant stress and anxiety. You can slow it down and Chartr is my go-to. Besides, the financial insights alone are enough to justify signing up.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/water-music.html">Water &amp; Music</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Best of Water Music</em></p>

<p>Water &amp; Music by Cherie Hu is a must-read. It sends music news &amp; industry related tidbits that are most definitely from an insider's point of view. Its content is second to none as far as newsletters go. You'll definitely walk away learning something new every time.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/inside-business.html">Inside Business</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The New Year's Mailbag</em></p>

<p>‘Inside Business' is yet another great daily newsletter that keeps you up to speed on the latest business and marketing news. They really pack in a lot of information in a small amount of words, and it's always good quality stuff. I've come to appreciate business a lot more since I subscribed to this newsletter.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">...and here are a few bonus ones that didn’t mention GPT-3 but GPT-3 offered opinions on just for giggles&nbsp;</h3>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/the-diff-by-byrne-hobart.html">The Diff</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>A Guide to the New World Order&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The Diff is a trusted source of information with some fun thrown in for good measure. Since the rise of AI and machine learning, a lot of white-collar workers have been apprehensive about their jobs, well, at least those that are repetitious or involve data entry. This tech newsletter does a great job at presenting an alternate view and options so that its subscribers don't have to worry.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/parentdata-by-emily-oster.html">ParentData</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The newsletter that doesn't suck and is really useful for parents of young children.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>There are huge piles of books on parenting and thousands upon thousands of articles from magazines and journals, so how could anyone keep up with it all? The answer is simple: they can't. That is why ParentData was created. They deal with topics on Infant &amp; Toddler development, strategies to motivate your child, discipline tips, what children are Learning, health and safety guidelines, teenage issues and good nutrition. Some of the top stories from a recent newsletter include the importance of healthy eating and how your kids can improve their behavior.</p>

<h3><em><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/daily-skimm.html">The Skimm</a></em></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Skimm is a very useful tool for your business</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">It's come under fire lately for not being the most diverse newsletter, but it's my favorite to start my day. I really enjoy the tone and the simple writing style. It's a nice reminder of what the day holds, and it usually makes me smile. I love having an outsider's look at the American elections, too.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://narrowscale.com/newsletters/a-media-operator-by-jacob-cohen-donnelly.html">A Media Operator</a></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><em>The News-Ticker's Guide to Life in the 21st Century</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">A Media operator is a weekly digital news service that helps content creators, entrepreneurs and investors build a sustainable business on the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[Go vs. Rust: Writing a CLI Tool]]>

August 3, 2020 | https://cuchi.me/posts/go-vs-rust | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cuchi.me/posts/go-vs-rust">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cuchi/59255d61717e2d469263eb86cf083067/raw/6ef1a42f335022adf481fb84cabc32ac47f18679/go-vs-rust.png" alt="Go vs. Rust"></p>
<p>This text is about my adventure writing a small CLI application (twice) using
two languages I had little experience with.</p>
<p>If you are eager to jump right into the code and compare it yourself, check it
out the <a href="https://github.com/cuchi/hashtrack/tree/master/cli-go">Go source</a> and
the <a href="https://github.com/cuchi/hashtrack/tree/master/cli-rust">Rust source</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>I have a <em>pet project</em> called Hashtrack, which is a full-stack web application I
wrote for a technical interview. This project is rather small and it is simple
to use:</p>
<ol>
<li>You authenticate - considering you already created your account</li>
<li>You input hashtags you want to track</li>
<li>You wait for the <em>captured</em> tweets to show on your screen</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://hashtrack.herokuapp.com/">Check it out here.</a></p>
<p>After my interview, I kept improving this project just for fun, and I noticed
that it could be a perfect place to test my skills by implementing a CLI tool. I
already had the server, so I just needed to pick a language to implement a small
set of features under my project's API.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>hashtrack login</code> - Creates a session token and store it in the local
filesystem in a config file.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack logout</code> - Remove the locally stored session token.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack track &lt;hashtag&gt; [...]</code> - Tracks one or more hashtags.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack untrack &lt;hashtag&gt; [...]</code> - Untracks one or more previously tracked
hashtags.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack tracks</code> - Displays the hashtags you are tracking.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack list</code> - Displays the latest 50 captured tweets.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack watch</code> - Stream and display the captured tweets in real-time.</li>
<li><code>hashtrack status</code> - Displays who you are, if logged in.</li>
<li>Should have an <code>--endpoint</code> option to point the CLI to another server.</li>
<li>Should have a <code>--config</code> option to load a custom config file.</li>
<li>This config file could also share the <code>endpoint</code> property.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we have to know beforehand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CLI should use the project's API, which is GraphQL under HTTP +
WebSockets.</li>
<li>The CLI should use the filesystem to store a config file.</li>
<li>The CLI should parse positional arguments and flags.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How did I end up using Go and Rust?</h2>
<p>There is a large set of languages you can use to write CLI tools.</p>
<p>In this case, I wanted a language I had little or no prior experience with, I
also wanted one that could easily compile to a native executable, which is a
nice perk to have on a CLI tool.</p>
<p>My first obvious choice was Go, maybe because a lot of CLI tools I use are
implemented using it. But I also had little experience with Rust, and I saw it
could also be a good fit for this project.</p>
<p>So... why not both? Since my main objective here is to learn, could be a great
opportunity to implement this project twice and find what are the <em>pros and
cons</em> of each one from my point of view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honorable mentions to <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> and
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>, those were very promising options too. I'm looking
forward to learn about them in another pet project.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Local environment</h2>
<p>The first thing I look when using a new toolset is whether it has an easy way to
make it available for my user, without using the distribution package manager to
install it system-wide. We are talking about version managers, they make our
life easier by installing the tools in a user-wide manner instead of
system-wide. <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">NVM</a> for Node.js does it very well.</p>
<p>When using Go, there is the <a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gvm">GVM</a> project which
handles the local install &amp; version management, and it is easy to setup:</p>
<pre><code>gvm install go1.14 -B
gvm use go1.14
</code></pre>
<p>There are also two environment variables we need to know, they are <code>GOROOT</code> and
<code>GOPATH</code> -- You can read more about them
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-goroot-and-gopath.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first <em>problem</em> I found using Go, was when I was figuring out how the module
resolution worked along with the <code>GOPATH</code>, it became quite frustrating to
set up a project structure with a functional local development environment.</p>
<p>In the end, I just used <code>GOPATH=$(pwd)</code> in my project's directory, the main perk
was to have a per-project dependency setup, like a <code>node_modules</code>. It worked
well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After finishing my project, I found out that
<a href="https://github.com/GetStream/vg">virtualgo</a> existed and would solve my problems
with <code>GOPATH</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rust has an official project called <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a>, which manages
the Rust installation, also known as <em>toolchain</em>. It can be easily set up with a
one-liner. Also, there is a set of optional components using <code>rustup</code>,
such as the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls">rls</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt</a>.
Many projects require a <em>nightly</em> version of the Rust toolchain, with <code>rustup</code>
there was no problem switching between the versions.</p>
<h3>Editor Support</h3>
<p>For both of the languages, editor tooling was flawless, as a VSCode user, I can
find extensions for both Go and Rust in the marketplace.</p>
<p>When debugging with Rust, I had to install the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb">CodeLLDB</a>
extension after following
<a href="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/how-to-debug-rust-with-visual-studio-code/">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2>Package management</h2>
<p>Go doesn't have a package manager or even an official registry. Instead, its
module resolution works in a way you can import them from external URLs.</p>
<p>For dependency management, Rust uses the Cargo, which downloads and compiles
dependencies from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is the official
registry for Rust packages. Packages inside the Crates ecosystem can also have
their documentation available in <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a></p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>My first objective was to see how easy could be to implement a simple GraphQL
query/mutation over HTTP.</p>
<p>For the Go language, I found some libraries, like
<a href="https://github.com/machinebox/graphql">machinebox/graphql</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/shurcooL/graphql">shurcooL/graphql</a>, the second one uses
structs for (un) marshaling the data, that is what made me stick to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used a fork of shurcooL/graphql, because I needed to set the
<code>Authorization</code> header in the client, the changes are in
<a href="https://github.com/shurcooL/graphql/pull/48">this pull request</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Go example of an GraphQL mutation call:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> creationMutation <span>struct</span> {
    CreateSession <span>struct</span> {
        Token graphql.String
    } <span>`graphql:"createSession(email: $email, password: $password)"`</span>
}

<span>type</span> CreationPayload <span>struct</span> {
    Email    <span>string</span>
    Password <span>string</span>
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>Create</span><span>(client *graphql.Client, payload CreationPayload)</span> <span>(<span>string</span>, error)</span></span> {
    <span>var</span> mutation creationMutation
    variables := <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>interface</span>{}{
        <span>"email"</span>:    graphql.String(payload.Email),
        <span>"password"</span>: graphql.String(payload.Password),
    }
    err := client.Mutate(context.Background(), &amp;mutation, variables)

    <span>return</span> <span>string</span>(mutation.CreateSession.Token), err
}

</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, I had to use two libraries to make GraphQL calls. That is because
<code>graphql_client</code> is protocol-agnostic, it only focuses on code generation for
serializing and deserializing data. So I needed a second library (<code>reqwest</code>) to
take care of the HTTP requests.</p>
<pre><code><span>#[derive(GraphQLQuery)]</span>
<span>#[graphql(
    schema_path = <span>"graphql/schema.graphql"</span>,
    query_path = <span>"graphql/createSession.graphql"</span>
)]</span>
<span><span>struct</span> <span>CreateSession</span></span>;

<span>pub</span> <span><span>struct</span> <span>Session</span></span> {
    <span>pub</span> token: <span>String</span>,
}

<span>pub</span> <span><span>type</span> <span>Creation</span></span> = create_session::Variables;

<span>pub</span> <span>async</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>create</span></span>(context: &amp;Context, creation: Creation) -&gt; <span>Result</span>&lt;Session, api::Error&gt; {
    <span>let</span> res = api::build_base_request(context)
        .json(&amp;CreateSession::build_query(creation))
        .send()
        .<span>await</span>?
        .json::&lt;Response&lt;create_session::ResponseData&gt;&gt;()
        .<span>await</span>?;
    <span>match</span> res.data {
        <span>Some</span>(data) =&gt; <span>Ok</span>(Session {
            token: data.create_session.token,
        }),
        _ =&gt; <span>Err</span>(api::Error(api::get_error_message(res).to_string())),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Neither of the libraries for Go and Rust had any implementation for GraphQL via
WebSocket protocol.</p>
<p>In fact, <code>graphql_client</code> for Rust supports <em>Subscriptions</em>, but since it is
protocol-agnostic, I had to implement the whole GraphQL WebSocket communication
on my own,
<a href="https://github.com/cuchi/hashtrack/blob/b5a75f4368837cd51c621b6560a03e1835ec4e5b/cli-rust/src/tweet.rs#L90">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>To use WebSockets in the Go version, the library should be modified to support
the protocol. Since I was already using a fork of the library, I didn't feel
like doing it. Instead, I used a poor man's way of "watching" the new tweets,
which was to request the API every 5 seconds to retrieve them,
<a href="https://github.com/cuchi/hashtrack/blob/b5a75f4368837cd51c621b6560a03e1835ec4e5b/cli-go/src/hashtrack/tweets/tweets.go#L65">I'm not proud of it</a>.</p>
<p>Using Go, there is the <code>go</code> keyword to spawn a lightweight thread, also called
<em>goroutine</em>. In contrast, Rust uses operating system threads by calling a
<code>Thread::spawn</code>. Besides that, both implementations use channels to transfer
objects between their threads.</p>
<h2>Error handling</h2>
<p>In Go, errors are treated just like any other value. The common way to handle
errors in Go is to just check if they are present.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(config *Config)</span> <span>Save</span><span>()</span> <span>error</span></span> {
	contents, err := json.MarshalIndent(config, <span>""</span>, <span>"    "</span>)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> err
	}

	err = ioutil.WriteFile(config.path, contents, <span>0</span>o644)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> err
	}

	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust has the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> enum, which can encapsulate an <code>Ok(T)</code> for success,
or an <code>Err(E)</code> for errors. It also has the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum, with <code>Some(T)</code> or
<code>None</code>. If you are familiar with Haskell, you may recognize
those as the <code>Either</code> and the <code>Maybe</code> monads.</p>
<p>There is also a syntactic sugar for error propagation (the <code>?</code> operator) that
resolves the value from the <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code> structure, automatically
returning <code>Err(...)</code> or <code>None</code> when something goes bad.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>save</span></span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) -&gt; io::<span>Result</span>&lt;()&gt; {
    <span>let</span> json = serde_json::to_string(&amp;<span>self</span>.contents)?;
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> file = File::create(&amp;<span>self</span>.path)?;
    file.write_all(json.as_bytes())
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above is the equivalent of</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>save</span></span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) -&gt; io::<span>Result</span>&lt;()&gt; {
    <span>let</span> json = <span>match</span> serde_json::to_string(&amp;<span>self</span>.contents) {
        <span>Ok</span>(json) =&gt; json,
        <span>Err</span>(e) =&gt; <span>return</span> <span>Err</span>(e.into())
    };
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> file = <span>match</span> File::create(&amp;<span>self</span>.path) {
        <span>Ok</span>(file) =&gt; file,
        <span>Err</span>(e) =&gt; <span>return</span> <span>Err</span>(e.into())
    };
    file.write_all(json.as_bytes())
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust has:</p>
<ul>
<li>monadic constructs (<code>Option</code> &amp; <code>Result</code>)</li>
<li>the error propagation operator</li>
<li>the <code>From</code> trait, to automatically convert errors on propagation</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of the three features above makes up the best error handling
solution I saw in a language, being simple, sound, and maintainable at the same
time.</p>
<h2>Compilation time</h2>
<p>Go is built with fast compilation time as a critical requirement, let's see:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; time go get hashtrack 
go get hashtrack  1,39s user 0,41s system 43% cpu 4,122 total

&gt; time go build -o hashtrack hashtrack 
go build -o hashtrack hashtrack  0,80s user 0,12s system 152% cpu 0,603 total

&gt; time go build -o hashtrack hashtrack 
go build -o hashtrack hashtrack  0,19s user 0,07s system 400% cpu 0,065 total

&gt; time go build -o hashtrack hashtrack 
go build -o hashtrack hashtrack  0,94s user 0,13s …</code></pre></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For the last year-plus, for most of my solo work, I’ve used a tool called <a href="https://github.com/abe-winter/automigrate">automig</a> to automatically turn my SQL schema changes into deltas that can be applied to a DB
(plug – I wrote it).</p>

<p>I hate writing migrations because it feels like work a computer should know how to do,
and because in general there’s no guarantee that the migrations produce something equivalent to your ‘schema.sql’ or ORM definition.</p>

<p>(SQLAlchemy’s alembic has an <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html">autogenerate feature</a> which compares a running DB to your ORM spec;
having a running DB in the loop for migration generation creates a different set of tradeoffs than automig, which analyzes the sql files directly).</p>

<p>This article is a pros and cons retrospective on that year.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#pros" id="markdown-toc-pros">Pros</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cons" id="markdown-toc-cons">Cons</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

<p><strong>I haven’t written a migration in 1+ years</strong>.
And I don’t love writing migrations.
My process to add a column has fewer steps.
This is a win.</p>

<p><strong>Simple and readable source of truth</strong>.
As long as you trust that the tool knows what it’s doing,
you can open up the <code>schema.sql</code> file (or whatever you choose to name yours) and get a schema that is <em>both</em>
a readable doc of what the database should have
and a reliable indicator of what the database actually has.</p>

<p><strong>Standard tool across different languages</strong>.
I’ve used automig on different python and golang projects and it doesn’t care.
It’s not linked to any design or tool decision inside the codebase.
Automig isn’t a standard tool, but if it were, it would be a portable skillset.</p>

<p><strong>No cluttered migrations dir</strong>.
More of a personal hygiene decision than a legit gripe, but migration directories aren’t my favorite; hundreds of files that do very little good.
Automig is also faster at reinitialization because you can start from git HEAD rather than applying hundreds of changes from the last 36 months.</p>

<p><strong>Turns something complicated into something simple and almost as good</strong>.
There are cons (see below) but there’s a bunch of migration-related work that I no longer think about.
I no longer dread adding a DB column or an index.
If my capabilities are less because the tool is simpler and declarative, that’s a tradeoff, but it’s one that I’ve lived with happily.</p>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

<p><strong>Data migrations not supported</strong>.
Automig is good at schema migrations but doesn’t have an easy way to transform columns or run code on your DB.
The tool has an answer to this in the roadmap.
For my own needs I’ve been able to work around this by doing two-step migrations with default values.</p>

<p>For larger users, data migrations involve lots of design (see for example github’s GH-OST tool).
In the future I think migrations should be a native feature in the DB –
you should upload a schema and specify whether migrations run up-front or on read.
And we shouldn’t tie type to storage locality.</p>

<p><strong>When something goes wrong, I have to fix it</strong>.
This is 50% a gripe about using a tool that I maintain and am the only user of.
But 50% a legit point that a ‘declarative diffing’ tool has more logic in it than migrations that you write yourself in SQL.
Running arbitrary SQL gives you a lot of flexibility and gives you infinite freedom to choose incompatible dialects.</p>

<p><strong>Extra lifting to integrate with ORMs</strong>.
Automig can generate SQLAlchemy definitions from your schema.sql, but that’s it.
If you use a single language / framework, defining your DB in an ORM is probably more useful than having it specified using SQL.</p>

<p><strong>Dialect support is no picnic</strong>.
When I switched from postgres to sqlite for some projects, it was a pain to support the different dialects.
I ran into things like different support for transactional DDL.</p>

<p>(Since I first wrote this I’ve seen comments from the skeema and migra committers.
Both of these tools support <em>only one</em> DB: mysql and postgres respectively, and rely on the DB to do the heavy lifting.
There are a lot of positives to this approach).</p>

<p><strong>Branch conflict issues + rebasing</strong>.
Any nonlinear git history can be a source of errors.
Automig has an <code>--opaque</code> switch to work around these, but manually-specified migrations are likely better at branches, especially if you need to support out-of-order changes.
I haven’t encountered these problems because I’m in solo codebases, but I can see there being issues in big teams who sometimes deploy from non-main branches.</p>

<p><strong>Migrating production involves up-front work</strong>.
If you use your main backend language / framework to run migrations, life is easy.
Automig has extra requirements: it needs to bundle the <code>.git</code> folder (i.e. whole history).
When I ran this on lambda, I had to also bundle a git binary, and my ubuntu binary <em>didn’t work</em>.
I spent a whole day learning how to build git statically before I realized I could just grab the centos one.
The good news is that this work only has to be done once per platform.</p>

<p><strong>Testing is annoying</strong>.
Because automig only works on committed changes, I sometimes have to do a few rounds of <code>git commit --amend</code> before things work.</p>

<p><strong>Column order</strong>.
Automig doesn’t guarantee column order (it does <code>add column</code> but not <code>add column b after a</code>).
This has caused issues with backup / restore.
It’s a problem with the tool but not necessarily with the approach of using git + sql as the source of truth.</p>

<p><strong>Weird parser</strong>.
My parser library is easily confused, especially by uppercase / lowercase and names that look like keywords.
And it’s multi-layer (I use python sqlparse and then wrap it), i.e. janky.
This isn’t an issue with the approach so much as the specific tools I use, but it causes problems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobhscott/"><strong>Jacob Scott</strong></a> is an experienced engineer and enthusiastic participant in the resilience engineering community, having spent time caring for the technology systems powering high-growth startups as well as unicorns like Lyft and Stripe. He is deeply passionate about how to apply learnings from modern safety science to real, complex socio-technical systems.<br></p><p>Blameless SRE <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellpappa/"><strong>Darrell Pappa</strong></a> recently interviewed Jacob to delve into how his research has informed his career journey and experiences to-date, especially in his latest role at Stripe where he helps operate the economic infrastructure of the Internet.<br></p><p>The following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.<br></p><p><strong>Darell Pappa</strong>: Jacob, it’s great to connect. How's it going?<br></p><p><strong>Jacob Scott</strong>: There's actually some interesting <a href="https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/">Adaptive Capacity Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/">Learning from Incidents</a> stuff on <a href="https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/resilience-engineering-diary-covid-19/">this topic</a>, of <em>“How's it going”</em> during the coronavirus. When you meet someone, it's usually like, <em>"How are you?</em>" And, <em>"I'm good." </em>I think it's helpful to be like, <em>"Well, I'm good, given the circumstances."</em> Right? The world is in an odd and unfortunate place, but given where it is, I'm doing pretty well. How about yourself?<br></p><p><strong>Darell Pappa:</strong> Yeah, especially with the circumstances, it's been challenging for sure, but I'm happy we can connect. <strong>I wanted to first kick us off by diving into your background and some highlights from your journey to date.</strong><br></p><p><strong>Jacob Scott:</strong> A long time ago I was actually a theoretical computer scientist&nbsp; Approximation algorithms, combinatorial optimization. I did research in that domain in undergrad. I went to grad school. I dropped out with a master's. And then in 2008, when I left grad school and started my career in industry, I joined Palantir. This was an interesting company to join. It was a different president, different time, but with everything that's happening in the intersection of society and technology today, it’s really interesting to reflect on working in a company at the center of that.<br></p><p>I was there from 2008 to 2013, and saw it go from 100-200 people to over 1,000. I was a backend generalist in Java, frequently a tech lead or lead engineer on a variety of projects. Then after Palantir, a friend from grad school convinced me to join as a very early engineer at a startup doing productized machine learning on sales and marketing data, solving the same problem for many SMBs. That was pretty interesting. I had a horizontal portfolio as there weren't that many engineers—maybe there were 10 or 20 engineers max—and so there I did a lot more. It was Python instead of Java. I did a lot of Postgres stuff, data pipelines, external data integrations, all sorts of random things.<br></p><p><strong>Darell Pappa: </strong>Looks like a pretty big change from your previous role.<br></p><p><strong>Jacob Scott: </strong>It was, with the intent of optimizing for learning new experiences. It's an approach that I have. Who knows what will make me the most energized and fulfilled? But if I triangulate, I'll learn more by doing something sort of different. You learn a lot, not just technically, but about how the industry works, how Silicon Valley works.<br></p><p>An interesting thing throughout my career, both at Palantir, and then at Infer, Lyft and Stripe, has been the relationship between the business and the technology. There’s always someone on Hacker News saying, <em>"Well, why didn't you use this?</em>" Or, <em>"I could build this thing in a weekend with my buddy."</em> But you can't necessarily build the support arm, the data science arm, the regulatory compliance arm, everything you need to actually have a functioning business. When you're growing and you're the darling of Silicon Valley and you're getting lots of money, you can attract all the right people. This lifts all your boats.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I was at Palantir for about five years, Infer for four years. I left Infer and ended up going to Lyft. At Infer, if you had the AWS root [access], and the log-in, if you were one of the early people setting up the TSDB, basic observability stack, you just kind of did it and hopefully the site wouldn't crash. I went to Lyft with that context.<br></p><p>Lyft obviously has a very sophisticated observability service mesh set up. <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/talking-with-matt-klein-about-a-culture-of-reliability">Matt Klein</a> wrote <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> at Lyft having seen a lot of stuff at Twitter and AWS that helped inform that. He wrote it with the team at Lyft, and it was interesting to see that technology. Palantir had been early, maybe early 2008 to 2013. People were doing whatever made sense. Then Infer was small. Lyft had an incident program. But despite the sophisticated measures in place, incidents would still arise. Whether they're related to your project or not, they overlap your sphere of ownership and things derailed a bit.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So I got curious about the fact that there were so many smart people — the number two ride sharing company, raised lots of money, very sophisticated technology — but the incidents would sometimes be kind of like, <em>“We didn't have this graph, this detector, we didn't notice this thing."</em></p><p>It went on. Not like a hard failure, not like 500s and everything smashed. But especially if you're dealing with machine learning, something can be wrong and have a financial or user impact failure. You can notice these sorts of grey failures later than you'd like, and you end up with an impactful incident<br></p><p>You wish it wouldn't have happened, and so it's like,<em> "How did we get here?"</em> <strong>How do you make sense out of the fact that there's so much success, and so much on fire. </strong>That led me at Lyft to move teams. I joined initially to work on problems in the mapping space, which is interesting for Lyft because time and distance play an important role in which driver you dispatch to what passenger, and they also play in pricing. They're low-level Lego bricks. I moved from there to a team focused on chaos engineering and cross-cutting reliability, working on bot-based load testing that was actually a very successful source of reliability for Lyft. Eventually in the summer of 2019, I ended up leaving Lyft, and was lucky enough to spend about six months exploring resilience engineering.<br></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/MissAmyTobey">Amy Tobey</a> is at Blameless now, and she's obviously in that community and amazing. Something I got really interested in was: Whether it's socio-technical systems or cognitive systems engineering or the intersection of modern safety science and software systems, there’s this sort of explanatory power or interesting perspective that could say, <em>“Well... If you look at this dynamic system in a much larger sense, maybe you could see how you could get such a bad break. How could </em><a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/cloud-networking/19009"><em>Google go down for six hours last summer</em></a><em>? How could CloudFlare </em><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/"><em>ship a regex bomb in their </em></a><em>WAF rules?”</em> People want functionality, right? You can't test things perfectly.<br></p><p>And so after being lucky enough to spend some time at the <a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/">South Park Commons</a>, which is a group in San Francisco for people in between, I decided it was time to go and reapply all this. And so I joined Stripe in February just in time, just before Coronavirus.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Darell Pappa: </strong>Nice. <strong>What is it that fascinates you, draws you to resilience engineering.</strong> It seems to me it expands outside of software. Amy just did a relevant <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/sre-leaders-panel-managing-systems-complexity">panel discussion</a> with Ward Cunningham and Tim Tischler from New Relic and Jessica Kerr.<br></p><p><strong>Jacob Scott: </strong>Yeah. I need to watch that. I try to keep up with talks online with various folks in the wider <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/">Learning from Incidents</a> community, and ground myself in thinking about modern safety science as applied to tech industry startups, unicorns, etc. Resilience engineering actually is one flavor of modern safety science. There's also, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_reliability_organization#:~:text=A%20high%20reliability%20organization%20(HRO,to%20risk%20factors%20and%20complexity.">high reliability organizations</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Resilience engineering is this sort of academic practitioner core of scientists and researchers such as <a href="https://erikhollnagel.com/ideas/resilience-engineering.html">Hollnagel</a>, <a href="https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/david-woods/">Woods</a>, <a href="http://sidneydekker.com/">Dekker</a> who write about it and have studied it for a couple of decades. <strong>There's an evolving view of what does safety mean?</strong> <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/">Leveson</a>. It’s all there in factories, cars, medicine, power plants, software systems. We want systems to do some things and not others, sometimes implicitly. That's where edge use cases have come from. <em>"I would like A plus B to equal C."</em> It's like, <em>"Well, what about overflow, underflow, floats, conversion?</em>" I don't want to think about that; infer what I want. But computers aren't that smart.<br></p><p><strong>When I think about resilience engineering or modern safety science in general, it sprawls very quickly. It’s first really embracing the totality, a larger view of a system.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>So rather than saying, <em>"I want a service mesh, so I should use Envoy. And if I have my generate retries and circuit breakers and all these things set correctly, and I have the right dashboards and all of these things, then I'll have a reliable system"...</em><br></p><p>Resilience engineering would say, <em>"Okay, but who are the people? Who's going to get paged? What's going to happen when they get paged? How ergonomic will the dashboards be? Do you understand these systems? If there's a high-priority feature request from the business, will that draw resources away? You plan to deploy Envoy, does it sort of pause well? Can you go partway into this migration? Are you setting yourself up for a fragile, brittle, all-or-nothing sort of situation?”</em><br>Specifically, questions in resilience engineering that I find myself relying on a lot...one is, <strong><em>“How did it make sense at the time?”</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>Which is maybe cognitive systems engineering. People generally don't show up to work to mess up and ruin things for customers or their coworkers. If something bad happened then it's because someone tried to do the right thing, or took a series of actions that they thought would have a positive outcome, but it did not. How did it make sense to them? This is cognitive perspective.</p><blockquote>People generally don't show up to work to mess up and ruin things for customers or their coworkers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the era of reliability, where mere minutes of downtime or latency can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, 24x7 availability and on-call coverage to respond to incidents has become a requirement for the vast majority of organizations. But setting up an on-call system that drives effective incident response while minimizing the stress placed on engineers isn’t a trivial task. Establishing equitable on-call rotations, putting the right guardrails and automation in place, and regular incident practice are key. In this blog, we’ll share key tools and practices to ensure your on-call engineers are set up for success.</p><h3>On-call practices and policies</h3><p>When setting up your on-call system, it is important to define clear and consistent policies and practices. When taking on on-call responsibilities, engineers shouldn’t need to reinvent the wheel when the pager goes off; ideally, the planning around severity, incident playbooks, and more should take place during peacetime. The team should work together to create rules that dictate when and how on-call escalations happen. Make sure you have the following worked out before implementing an on-call system.<br></p><h4><strong>Creating Rotation Schedules</strong><br></h4><p>First, you’ll need to build your on-call schedule. Work out which engineers would need to be available for different system areas where incidents could occur, by looking at where each engineer has ownership and domain expertise. Create teams to maximize diversity and coverage, allowing for each time to respond effectively to many different types of incidents. Fill out a calendar with these teams, making sure every shift is covered for your rotation period.<br></p><p>During all of this, consult with your engineers to ensure that your schedules are reasonable and fair. How long should an on-call shift last? How frequently should a team go on-call? What should the procedure be if an engineer has to change shifts? To keep morale high and teams responding effectively, make sure every engineer has a fair say in these choices.<br></p><p>Be prepared to change your rotation schedule frequently, even after implementation. The reality of working on-call shifts is often very different than predicted, so look at on-call data to uncover whether certain individuals are overburdened with off-hours interruptions or critical incidents, and load balance accordingly. Be flexible in hearing out people’s concerns as they develop. External business changes and stages in development cycles can also drastically change the nature of on-call shifts, so be prepared to reflect those with adjustments to shift lengths and rotation frequencies.<br></p><p>Because of these constant changes, it’s important to keep the rotation schedule up-to-date. Make sure it’s kept in a place where it’s convenient to make changes, automated and easy to integrate with different systems, and accessible to anyone. Many on-call platforms also offer scheduling tools to make this process easier and more robust.</p><h4><strong>Defining Escalation and Response Policies</strong><br></h4><p>The next set of policies you need to define is to decide when your on-call teams are actually contacted and how they respond. To combat alert fatigue, you’ll want to be judicious about when your teams are notified, but also ensure that critical incidents are not overlooked.<br></p><p>You should have a system to <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">classify incidents</a>, sorting them based on severity and affected area into established classifications. These classifications will determine who is alerted and what response is necessary. This response should also include timelines for when incidents of severity need to be resolved before you violate <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs or SLAs</a>.<br></p><p>You can determine severity by looking at the <a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">business impact</a> of an incident — issues preventing customers from using services or violating SLAs require a much faster and larger response than a small component loading slightly slower than usual.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You’ll also need to prepare a defined response to each category of incidents. Engineers should be equipped with tools like <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">runbooks</a> to begin tackling an incident as soon as they’re alerted. These runbooks can also include checks for triggering further escalation. Make sure your on-call engineers are familiar with these runbooks, and confident about executing them when the time comes. Schedule regular review sessions to update runbooks based on incident retrospectives.</p><h4><strong>Cultivating On-Call Culture</strong><br></h4><p>Between being called out of bed in the wee hours, having to handle incidents with fewer teammates and resources than normal, and facing extreme pressure to restore service as business reputation is on the line, on-call can be an extremely stressful experience. Being overwhelmed by on-call responsibilities, believing that on-call duties are assigned unfairly, or generally feeling under-appreciated can quickly destroy engineers’ morale and accelerate burnout.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Combat these challenges by cultivating an empathetic on-call culture that puts people first.<br></p><p>Involve engineers in setting schedules and other policies. Hear out their experiences, celebrating their successes and addressing their struggles. Make sure you hear these concerns blamelessly; instead of attributing setbacks or miscommunications to individuals, look at the systems behind them. Protect against a ‘hero’ culture, and embrace sustainable on-call through eliminating single points of failure, and embracing smaller and more frequent changes, distributed rotations, and continuous learning.<br></p><blockquote>Reframe incidents from failures and setbacks to investments in future reliability — every incident, when properly addressed, makes the response to each future incident better. Likewise, each on-call shift is an investment in making future on-call shifts better. When there’s challenges in load balancing, having effective responses prepared, or proper escalation, embrace them as opportunities to refine and grow.<br></blockquote><p>For more tips on how to implement empathetic and effective on-call practices, check out our top 5 on-call practices <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/our-top-5-on-call-practices">here</a>.</p><h3>On-call Software</h3><p>Implementing on-call practices is a complicated process, but fortunately there are great paid as well as free on-call tools and platforms to help. The most popular tools include PagerDuty, OpsGenie, VictorOps, Cabot, and LinkedIn On-Call (open source)<br></p><p>When selecting an on-call tool, some important requirements to consider include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Alerting through phone, SMS, Hipchat, or email</li><li>Breadth of integrations across the tech stack, from cloud monitoring to source control</li><li>Alert grouping, filtering, and de-duplication</li><li>Team-based management</li><li>Simple visualization of teams’ statuses across the calendar</li><li>Rock-solid reliability</li></ul><p>On-call is an essential component of a reliable system. To take your on-call and reliability practice to the next level, you’ll need to codify context into guardrails and automation, minimize toil, and foster a culture that is inclined toward curiosity instead of blame. Blameless can help you get more out of your on-call and broader reliability efforts&nbsp; by integrating valuable data from SLOs, incident checklists, , postmortems, follow-up action items, and much more.

Yet, the Baidu authors write:</p><figure><pre><code>This paper is not intended to introduce a novel object detecotor. 
It is more like a recipe, which tell you how to build a better detector step by step.</code></pre><figcaption>Mysterious introduction in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO paper</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let's unpack that.</p><h2 id="yolo-development-history">YOLO Development History</h2><p>YOLO was originally authored by Joseph Redmon to detect objects. Object detection is a computer vision technique that localizes and tags objects by drawing a bounding box around them and identifying the class label that a given box belongs too. Unlike massive NLP transformers, YOLO is designed to be tiny, enabling realtime inference speeds for deployment on device. &nbsp;</p><p>YOLO-9000 was the second "YOLOv2" object detector published by Joseph Redmon, improving the detector and emphasizing the detectors ability to generalize to any object in the world.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-2.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/image-2.png 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-2.png 1810w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection/blob/release/0.4/docs/tutorials/Custom_DataSet.md">PP-YOLO</a> is being trained to identify different fruit flies in this photo.</figcaption></figure><p>YOLOv3 made further improvements to the detection network and began to mainstream the object detection process. We began to publish tutorials on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/releasing-a-new-yolov3-implementation/">how to train YOLOv3 in PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-a-yolov3-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLOv3 in Keras</a>, and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov3-versus-efficientdet-for-state-of-the-art-object-detection/">compared YOLOv3 performance to EfficientDet </a>(another state of the art detector).</p><p>Then Joseph Redmon stepped out of the object detection game due to ethical concerns. </p><p>Naturally, the open source community picked up the baton and continues to move YOLO technology forward. </p><p>YOLOv4 was published recently this spring by Alexey AB in his for of the YOLO Darknet repository. YOLOv4 was primarily an ensemble of other known computer vision technologies, combined and validated through the research process. See here for a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">deep dive on YOLOv4</a>. The YOLOv4 paper reads similarly to the PP-YOLO paper, as we will see below. We put together some great training tutorials on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLOv4 in Darknet</a>.</p><p>Then, just a few months ago <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov5-is-here/">YOLOv5 was released</a>. YOLOv5 took the Darknet (C based) training environment and converted the network to PyTorch. Improved training techniques pushed performance of the model even further and created a great, easy to use, out of the box object detection model. Ever since, we have been encouraging developers using Roboflow to direct their attention to YOLOv5 for the formation of their custom object detectors via this <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/">YOLOv5 training tutorial</a>.</p><p>Enter PP-YOLO.</p><h2 id="what-does-pp-stand-for">What Does PP Stand For?</h2><p>PP is short for PaddlePaddle, a deep learning framework written by Baidu. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-9.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-9.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/image-9.png 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-9.png 1634w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/">PaddlePaddle</a> distributions provided on their website.</figcaption></figure><p>If PaddlePaddle is new to you, then we are in the same boat. Primarily written in Python, PaddlePaddle seems akin to PyTorch and TensorFlow. A deep dive into the PaddlePaddle framework is intriguing, but beyond the scope of this article. </p><h2 id="pp-yolo-contributions">PP-YOLO Contributions</h2><p>The PP-YOLO paper reads much like the YOLOv4 paper in that it is a compilation of techniques that are known to work in computer vision. The novel contribution is to prove that the ensemble of these technologies improves performance, and to provide an ablation study of how much each step helps the model along the way.</p><p>Before we dive into the contributions of PP-YOLO, it will be useful to review the YOLO detector architecture.</p><h3 id="anatomy-of-the-yolo-detector">Anatomy of the YOLO Detector</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image.png 1376w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A graphical depiction of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO</a> object detection network</figcaption></figure><p>The YOLO detector is broken into three main pieces.</p><p><strong>YOLO Backbone</strong> - The YOLO backbone is a convolutional neural network that pools image pixels to form features at different granularities. The Backbone is typically pretrained on a classification dataset, typically ImageNet.</p><p><strong>YOLO Neck - </strong>The YOLO neck (FPN is chosen above) combines and mixes the ConvNet layer representations before passing on to the prediction head.</p><p><strong>YOLO Head</strong> - This is the part of the network that makes the bounding box and class prediction. It is guided by the three YOLO loss functions for class, box, and objectness. </p><h2 id="now-let-s-dive-into-the-pp-yolo-contributions-">Now let's dive into the PP YOLO Contributions.</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-10.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-10.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-10.png 1136w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Marginal mAP accuracy performance increase from each technique in PP-YOLO</figcaption></figure><h3 id="replace-backbone">Replace Backbone</h3><p>The first PP YOLO technique is to replace the YOLOv3 Darknet53 backbone with the Resnet50-vd-dcn ConvNet backbone. Resnet is a more popular backbone, more frameworks are optimized for its execution, and it has fewer parameters than Darknet53. Seeing a mAP improvement by swapping this backbone is a huge win for PP YOLO. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-12.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-12.png 1422w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Graphical depiction in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf">ResNet</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="ema-of-model-parameters">EMA of Model Parameters</h3><p>PP YOLO tracks the Exponential Moving Average of network parameters to maintain a shadow of the models weights for prediction time. This has been shown to improve inference accuracy.</p><h3 id="larger-batch-size">Larger Batch Size</h3><p>PP-YOLO bumps the batch size up from 64 to 192. Of course, this is hard to implement if you have GPU memory constraints.</p><h3 id="dropblock-regularization">DropBlock Regularization</h3><p>PP YOLO implements DropBlock regularization in the FPN neck (in the past, this has usually occurred in the backbone). DropBlock randomly removes a block of the training features at a given step in the network to teach the model to not rely on key features for detection.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-16.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-16.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-16.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-16.png 1050w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12890.pdf">Drop Block</a> regularization technique - features are hidden in blocks (c) not randomly (b)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="iou-loss">IoU Loss</h3><p>The YOLO loss function does not translate well to the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">mAP metric</a>, which uses the Intersection over Union heavily in its calculation. Therefore, it is useful to edit the training loss function with this end prediction in mind. This edit was also present in YOLOv4.</p><h3 id="iou-aware">IoU Aware</h3><p>The PP-YOLO network adds a prediction branch to predict the model's estimated IOU with a given object. Including this IoU awareness when making the decision to predict an object or not improves performance.</p><h3 id="grid-sensitivity">Grid Sensitivity</h3><p>The old YOLO models do not do a good job of making predictions right around the boundaries of anchor box regions. It is useful to define box coordinates slightly differently to avoid this problem. This technique is also present in YOLOv4.</p><h3 id="matrix-nms">Matrix NMS </h3><p>Non-Maximum Suppression is a technique to remove over proposals of candidate objects for classification. Matrix NMS is a technique to sort through these candidate predictions in parallel, speeding up the calculation. </p><h3 id="coordconv">CoordConv</h3><p>CoordConv was motivated by the problems ConvNets were having with simply mapping (x,y) coordinates to a one-hot pixel space. The CoordConv solution gives the convolution network access to its own input coordinates. CoordConv interventions are marked with yellow diamonds above. More details are available in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03247.pdf">the CordConv paper</a>.</p><h3 id="spp">SPP</h3><p>Spatial Pyramid Pooling is an extra block after the backbone layer to mix and pool spatial features. Also implemented in YOLOv4 and YOLOv5.</p><h3 id="better-pretrained-backbone">Better Pretrained Backbone</h3><p>The PP YOLO authors distilled down a larger ResNet model to serve as the backbone. A better pretrained model shows to improve downstream transfer learning as well. </p><h2 id="is-pp-yolo-state-of-the-art"><br>Is PP-YOLO State of the Art?</h2><p>PP-YOLO outperforms the results <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf">YOLOv4 published</a> on April 23, 2020.</p><p>In fairness, the authors note this may be the wrong question to be asking. The authors' intent appears to not simply "introduce a new novel detector," rather to show the process of carefully tuning an object detector to maximize performance. Quoting the paper's introduction here:</p><blockquote>The focus of this paper is how to stack some effective tricks that hardly affect efficiency to get better performance... This paper is not intended to introduce a novel object detector. It is more like a recipe, which tell you how to build a better detector step by step. We have found some tricks that are effective for the YOLOv3 detector, which can save developers’ time of trial and error. <strong>The final PP-YOLO model improves the mAP on COCO from 43.5% to 45.2% at a speed faster than YOLOv4</strong></blockquote><p><em>(emphasis ours)</em></p><p>The PP-YOLO contributions reference above took the YOLOv3 model from 38.9 to 44.6 mAP on the COCO object detection task and increased inference FPS from 58 to 73. These metrics are shown in the paper to beat the currently published results for YOLOv4 and EfficientDet. </p><p>In benchmarking PP-YOLO against <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>, it appears <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a> still has the fastest inference time-to-accuracy performance (AP vs FPS) tradeoff on a V100. However, a YOLOv5 paper still remains to be released. Furthermore, it has been shown that training the YOLOv4 architecture on the YOLOv5 Ultralytics repository outperforms YOLOv5 and, transitively, YOLOv4 trained using YOLOv5 contributions would outperform the PP-YOLO results posted here. These results are still to be formally published but can be traced to <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/6">this GitHub discussion</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-14.png 1354w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO evaluation</a> on COCO dataset on V100 GPU (note AP_50 column)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-15.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-15.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/08/image-15.png 1304w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5 evaluation</a> on COCO dataset on V100 GPU (note AP_50 column)</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that many of the techniques (such as architecture search and data augmentation) that were used in YOLOv4 were not used in PP YOLO.

<p>I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open
    source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only
    time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly
    onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful.</p>
<p>To settle a few things. When I tweeted on this subject I only got the response that I should use vim. Thanks. Great.
    I can and do on use vim. That misses a number of points. Visual Studio Code is an immensely popular editor and
    likely the most common recommendations to new developers. The primary reason I've used Visual Studio Code is
    that it has an incredibly compelling solution for remote pairing in the form of LiveShare. I've used that for a
    while with great success mentoring, coaching and generally working with other developers of varying experience and
    editor preferences. Most programmers can handle a "normal" editor like VS Code while something like Emacs
    or Vim depends a lot more on what they've learned.</p>
<p>I also ended up enjoying the Remote series of extensions for developing effectively inside remote servers or local
    containers.</p>
<h2>These things are proprietary</h2>
<p>At some point I read a piece of license that said that LiveShare could only be used with the Visual Studio family of
    products. "Huh, that sounds weird, VS Code is open source right?"</p>
<p>Sure enough. VS Code is fully MIT. The binary distribution has a separate license to allow telemetry and protect
    Microsoft trademarks and stuff. Nothing particularly weird, I can't really get worked up about telemetry, I know
    some can. But the extensions.. These extensions are in my book core differentiators that makes VS Code compelling.
    For me it is definitely part of what pushes it beyond the much leaner Sublime (paid, closed source) I was using
    before.</p>
<p>These extensions have a license limiting them and their online service parts to only be used with the Visual Studio
    family of products. This is the <a href="https://microsoftdocs.github.io/live-share/license/eula.html" title="License for LiveShare">license for LiveShare</a> and this is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license" title="License for Remote">license for Remote</a>.</p>
<p>For me LiveShare is the most important thing. Google Docs style collaborative code editing, terminal sharing, port
    sharing and a bunch more features. I know Atom had an extension like this, I haven't checked the licensing there
    or tried it recently.</p>
<p>Remote is a very strong extension as well for anyone working on a server over SSH or in a container. It helps by
    installing extensions on the destination to allow language servers and such. I've seen it do terrible things to
    servers sometimes but it is very useful and generally works well.</p>
<p>It makes me uneasy to accept VS Code as an "open" project in any wider meaning of the word when compelling
    features are legally locked to only work inside the family of Visual Studio products. It makes me less certain that
    this isn't the Extend in Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. It also frustrates me that this prevents someone from
    building a compatible plugin for VIM or any other editor. This would be much more powerful if it could be in all the
    IntelliJs as well.</p>
<p>You'll find a repo for <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share" title="LiveShare on GitHub">LiveShare on GitHub</a> but it is only for documentation and issue tracking. There
    is no code. Same for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release" title="Remote on GitHub">Remote</a>.</p>
<h2>The entire marketplace is proprietary</h2>
<p>Some additional salt in this particular wound is that the use of the Marketplace of VS Code extensions is also
    proprietarily licensed. So all these open source developers are shoving their extensions into a competitive
    advantage for one of the world's largest tech firms. And they disallow other uses of the marketplace. Even if
    the letter of open source is followed there is none of the openness, collaborative or community essence that I think
    exemplifies open source and free software projects.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? I guess it protects from the competition. Such as the <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium" title="VS Codium">VS Codium</a> project which provides VS Code
    binaries without the proprietary parts. But also, as a consequence of this, without the Marketplace of extensions.
    There is an open source alternative called <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" title="Open VSX">Open VSX</a>, but since
    it isn't the canonical one it is missing a bunch of extensions and the big Liveshare and Remote ones are still
    not allowed.</p>
<p>This also blocks the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server" title="code-server">code-server editor</a> that
    allows running VS Code in the browser from using it which otherwise would have been perfect for me to do development
    on an iPad Pro. I can still use that but a lot of packages are not in Open VSX.</p>
<h2>What about lock-in?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is marketed with LiveShare and Remote as powerful extensions. VS Code is also marketed as open
    source. It is easy to use the editor, install the extensions and be under the impression that you are using an open
    source software suite where Microsoft simply hosts the peering service for identifying and connecting you and your
    collaborator.</p>
<p>But the peering service is not the only closed part. The extensions are not open source projects as far as I can find
    and they are licensed during distribution in a way that disallows using them with anything but Visual Studio
    products.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't sold on having an Electron-based editor to begin with but
    VS Code was substantially leaner than Atom so I've been mostly accepting it.</p>
<p>If you have good suggestions for strong collaborative development tools that are open source, please let me know at

<p>Does your company have a culture of letting everyone see each other’s calendars? Do people often schedule meetings whenever there are openings, without asking?</p>



<p>If so, your calendar is a blocklist. The only time that isn’t available for someone to steal is time that’s already spoken for. This is a problem. A time slot that isn’t currently booked shouldn’t be free real estate. That’s my TIME! You can’t just take it without asking.</p>



<p>Instead, your calendars should be an allowlist. You should say “if you want to talk to me, this is when you can” instead of “this is when you CAN’T.” You shouldn’t have to defend our time like it’s gold and your coworkers are pirates. You should just assume that it’s yours to spend how you see fit.</p>



<p>Some people block time off to try to protect their calendars. They create big “GTD” blocks on their calendar and hope that nobody books meetings on top of them. I’ve even heard of people creating fake or vague meeting titles in hopes that others will assume there’s a real meeting at that time. This is a crappy workaround, and it isn’t enough. </p>



<p>The solution should be office hours. You should be able to say say “I’m free for meetings from 2-5pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if you want to talk to me then that’s when you can.” In most companies, doing that would make you an annoyance. Those companies don’t respect Deep Work. </p>



<p>Scheduling meetings should be a little bit painful. You should have to really want it. You should be forced to question yourself. <em>Is this actually worth me going to the trouble of figuring out how to schedule this meeting? Or could it instead be an asynchronous discussion? </em>Office hours and calendars-as-allowlists have this added benefit.</p>



<p>Is your calendar an allowlist or a blocklist?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="python-packages"><a href="#python-packages" aria-label="python packages permalink"></a>Python Packages</h2>
<p>PyPi is the Python Package Index and is the main repository for Python packages installed via <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/">pip</a>. Since Python is one of the most popular programming languages out there and most users install packages hosted on PyPi, this makes for a very interesting dataset to estimate the popularity and usage of different Python packages.</p>
<p>As with any analysis of large scale datasets, there's a few caveats we should keep in mind when trying to make conclusions and infer patterns from this data. The PyPi dataset has an excellent disclaimer <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/#background">on their site</a> on the limitations of this data.</p>
<p><a href="https://preset.io/static/0f0c4095f6590f080215d0942c4c11d3/54f11/dataset_limitations.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>With these limitations, we can use this data to <em>estimate</em> things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>which new packages are rising in popularity quickly</li>
<li>which packages have reached maturity or have plateaued in downloads</li>
<li>which package is the most popular for a specific problem (like user authentication or visualization)</li>
</ul>
<p>These use cases are useful for the Python engineer looking to decide which package to incorporate into their code base or for the open source package maintainer looking to roughly track adoption.</p>
<p><strong>In this post, we'll explore how to connect BigQuery to Apache Superset.</strong></p>
<p>Apache Superset is an open-source business intelligence tool that provides a SQL interface, a no-code UI for creating visualizations, and a highly customizable dashboard layer to bring these visualizations together. Superset integrates with <a href="https://superset.apache.org/#databases">most popular databases and data engines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="public-datasets-on-google-bigquery"><a href="#public-datasets-on-google-bigquery" aria-label="public datasets on google bigquery permalink"></a>Public Datasets On Google BigQuery</h2>
<p>Google BigQuery is a data warehouse solution that's hosted on Google Cloud. Similar to it's Amazon counterpart, Redshift, BigQuery is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS">column oriented database system</a> that's optimized for analytics use cases.</p>
<p>BigQuery hosts a number of public datasets as part of their marketplace on Google Cloud. </p>

<p>As with every experiment using cloud resources, it's very important to understand and internalize how the fee structure works. Google charges around 2 axes of usage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>storage</strong>: how much data is actually stored</li>
<li><strong>compute</strong>: how much data is actually processed</li>
</ul>
<p>For public datasets, Google waives the associated storage costs but charges for accessing and scanning their centrally located public datasets. Google lets us <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data">query 1 terabyte per month</a> in an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#on_demand_pricing">on-demand way</a> for free and then they charge $5 per terabyte processed afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To use public datasets, we need to first create a project by heading to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?_ga=2.88969755.125825472.1596123671-646201415.1590849603">project selector page</a> and following the project setup wizard. You can read the updated instructions on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-web-ui">BigQuery documentation site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you've created a BigQuery project, you can add the PyPI downloads dataset just by navigating to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=the-psf&amp;d=pypi&amp;page=dataset">public dataset page</a>. If you're logged into BigQuery, you should see this dataset now registered in your project.</p>

  </span>
  </a></p>
<p>To provide access to BigQuery from outside of Google Cloud, we'll need to first create a Service Account. A <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts">Service Account</a> is essentially a user account that has specific permissions to access resources in Google Cloud programmatically (instead of just from the UI). Unlike a regular user account for humans, Service Accounts don't have passwords and instead access resources using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key cryptography</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Use the search bar to find and navigate to the "Service Accounts" configuration page.</p>

  </span>
  </a></p></div></div>
<p>Then, click <strong>+ Create Service Account</strong> under the search bar. You should still see your BigQuery project name next to "Google Cloud Platform", which is critical to ensuring the Service Account you're creating can access datasets you've added to your BigQuery project.</p>

  </a></p></div></div>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Step 1 of this wizard involves specifying an account name, ID, and description. Feel free to be creative here! When you're finished, click <strong>Create</strong> to be taken to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> In step 2 of this wizard, you need to search for and add "BigQuery User" to this service account. This enables this service account to run queries in BigQuery, create datasets, read dataset metadata, and list tables.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You can skip step 3 if you don't have an organization level <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#granting_access_to_a_user_for_a_service_account">IAM hierarchy</a> and are just trying this out first. You'll now be taken to a list of all of your Service Acounts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> The last step here is to select the service account you just created, create a new private-public key pair by selecting <strong>Add Key</strong>, and download your private key as a JSON file. Most services only let you download your private key once, so keep this file for safe keeping!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As one of the world’s biggest internet-based platform companies, Tencent uses technology to enrich the lives of users and assist the digital upgrade of enterprises. An example product is the popular WeChat application, which has over one billion active users worldwide. The Platform and Content Group (PCG) is responsible for integrating Tencent’s internet, social, and content platforms. PCG promotes the cross-platform and multi-modal development of IP, with the overall goal of creating more diversified premium digital content experiences. Since its inception, many major products—from the well-known QQ, QZone, video, App Store, news, and browser, to relatively new members of the ecosystem such as live broadcast, anime, and movies—have been evolving on top of consolidated infrastructure and a set of foundational technology components.</p>
<h2><a id="kafka-at-tencent-png"></a>Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> at Tencent PCG</h2>
<p>At our center stands the real-time messaging system that connects data and computing. We have proudly built many essential data pipelines and messaging queues around Apache Kafka. Our application of Kafka is similar to other organizations: We build pipelines for cross-region log ingestion, machine learning platforms, and asynchronous communication among microservices. The unique challenges come from stretching our architecture along multiple dimensions, namely scalability, customization, and SLA. Here are some of the notable requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workload.</strong> It takes close and continuous observation to fully grasp the dynamics of data in complex apps. In a highly seasonal and eventful environment of consumer internet with over a billion monthly active users, product promotion and large-scale experimentations often cause volume to burst up 20x from one day to another. At the peak, our pipeline needs to transfer 4 million messages per second (or 64 gigabytes/second) for a single product. Our ops team, therefore, is challenged with managing and optimizing clusters with more than a thousand physical nodes in total.</li>
<li><strong>Low latency and high SLA.</strong> As the organization moves quickly toward leveraging real-time analytics for driving business decisions, the requirements of data accuracy and timeliness become more rigid than before. Imagine when a video-consuming event is fed to the recommendation algorithm or when discovering hot trends that guide the incentivisation of content supply—it is desirable that the data can be used within a few seconds since its emission and with an end-to-end loss rate as low as 0.01%.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Nowadays real-time data processing architectures are componentized and configurable. Consequently, the messaging system needs to handle frequent changes in the number of consumers, access pattern, and topic distribution without impacting performance. We cannot simply optimize the system for a static topology as a traditional ingestion pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, we need a multi-tenant, gigantic pub/sub system to satisfy all these requirements. At peak time, it should reliably support data transfer at hundreds of gigabits per second. It should be provisioned almost instantly without disrupting existing workload; it also needs to tolerate single-node and cluster failure. Considering interface concerns, we want it to be compatible with the Kafka SDK as much as possible. After exploring the limitations of a single Kafka cluster, we’ve moved forward with a series of developments.</p>
<h2 id="federated-kafka-design"><a id="federated-kafka-design"></a>Federated Kafka design</h2>
<p>We chose to develop in the Kafka ecosystem for its maturity, rich set of clients and connectors, as well as superb performance among alternatives. On the other hand, there are a few gaps in using Apache Kafka to meet the requirements above. For instance, more than expected, we found during heavy usage that multiple disk failures caused insufficient replica or even cluster-level reliability problems. Moreover, expanding the capacity of a cluster (i.e., adding brokers) requires significant data rebalancing, often imposing hours of operational latency. Without fully automated capacity management, this greatly limits how we can support a large business.</p>
<p>Given that we decided to focus our initial enhancement on scalability and failure tolerance, we started off building a proxy layer that federates multiple Kafka clusters and provides compatible interfaces to both providers and consumers. The proxy layer presents logical topics to Kafka clients and internally maps them to distinct physical topics in each Kafka cluster. In the figure below, a logical topic with eight partitions (<code>P0–P7</code>) is distributed to two physical clusters each with four partitions (<code>P0–P3</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic.png" alt="P0-P7 | P0-P3" width="1999" height="522" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic-300x78.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic-1024x267.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic-768x201.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic-1536x401.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic-350x91.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-logical-topic-600x157.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px"></p>
<p>The extra layer of abstraction of logical topics allows us to achieve the following, desirable behavior. First, we can expand the capacity of the data pipeline with little (re)synchronization overhead. In case two clusters at their maximum size cannot handle the predicted peak volume, we can easily deploy two additional clusters without shuffling any existing data. Second, fault tolerance is easier to manage with smaller clusters, as we can provision extra capacity at fine granularity and redirect traffic at a low cost. Lastly, in the (not-so-rare) event of physical cluster migration, the transparent proxy eliminates the need for any code and configuration change on the application side. We would only need to set the old clusters in read-only mode before it is completely drained, while associating the proxy with the new clusters. Such maintenance is not visible from the perspective of logic topics.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-and-workflows"><a id="key-components-and-workflows"></a>Key components and workflows</h2>
<p>In this section, we get into more details of the new components we built and how they interact in essential scenarios, as shown in the figure below. Two proxy services, one for the producer (<code>pproxy</code>) and another for the consumer (<code>cproxy</code>), implement the core protocols of the Kafka broker. They are also responsible for mapping logical topics to their physical incarnation. The application uses the same Kafka SDK to connect directly to the proxy, which acts as a broker.</p>
<p>In order to address the set of proxy brokers, we built a lightweight name service that maintains this relationship between client ID and the collection of proxy servers. The SDK will request the list of proxy brokers using client ID once at the beginning of the communication. Internally, the most complicated and bulky part of our implementation involves managing the metadata of the federated cluster, including both the state of the topics as well as the lifecycle of the proxy nodes. We extract the logic of the Kafka controller node (such as topic metadata) into a separate service, which is also called “the controller,” but it is different from Kafka’s own controller functionality. This service is responsible for collecting the metadata of physical clusters, composing the partition information logical topics, and then publishing it to the proxy brokers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service.png" alt="Name service" width="1999" height="639" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service-300x96.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service-1024x327.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service-768x245.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service-1536x491.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service-350x112.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-name-service-600x192.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px"></p>
<p>We see some examples of interactions among these components and the Kafka clusters underneath during the most common operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logical topic metadata retrieval</strong><br>
<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval.png" alt="Logical topic metadata retrieval" width="1999" height="635" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval-300x95.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval-1024x325.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval-768x244.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval-1536x488.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval-350x111.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/logical-topic-metadata-retrieval-600x191.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px"><br>
1. Controller reads the mapping between logical topic and physical topic from the config database.<br>
2. Controller scans metadata of all physical topics from each Kafka cluster.<br>
3. Controller finds the list of available <code>pproxy</code> from heartbeat message.<br>
4. Controller composes the metadata for the logical topics.<br>
5. Controller pushes both the topic mapping and topic metadata to proxy brokers.<br>
6. The metadata is sent to the Kafka SDK.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="federated-kafka-in-practice"><a id="federated-kafka-in-practice"></a>Federated Kafka in practice</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we have gradually onboard many products in Tencent PCG to use the federated Kafka solution. Alongside the cluster, we have also been developing better monitoring and automated management tools. Our design principles have been quickly validated by many critical business use cases such as real-time analytics, feature engineering, and more. Up to now, we have deployed a few hundreds of clusters of various sizes, which collectively handle more than 10 trillion messages every day. The following table summarizes our typical setup and operational benchmarks.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Average time to initialize a federated cluster</td>
<td>10 minutes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average time to scaling up a federated cluster<br>
(add one physical cluster)</td>
<td>2 minutes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Metadata refresh latency</td>
<td>~1 second</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximum physical clusters per logical cluster</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Brokers per physical cluster</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total number of brokers provisioned</td>
<td>~500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Max cluster bandwidth (CPU ~40%)</td>
<td>240 Gb/s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proxy overhead</td>
<td>Same as Kafka broker</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are two notable limitations of the first design composed of cluster federation with a proxy layer. First, the distribution of logical partitions is not transparent to clients who use a hash key to specify the partition when producing a message. Consequently, when we add a new cluster, messages with identical keys might be delivered to different partitions and hence get out of order. This did not turn out to be a blocker for our current use cases for two reasons. First, we surveyed the product teams and found that they only use keyed messages occasionally. Furthermore, when they face the trade-off between application-level fault tolerance and scalability, they typically prefer the latter and sometimes settle with a mechanism to briefly halt production when cluster membership is updated.</p>
<p>A more fundamental limitation is that we have to frequently evolve the interface of the proxy broker as more functionalities need to be exposed and as native Kafka evolves. This leads to unnecessary code duplication and makes the whole system harder to manage. In the future, we will explore implementing similar semantics inside Kafka, as described in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps"><a id="next-steps"></a>Next steps</h2>
<p>As we explained above, Tencent is one of the largest Kafka users in the world, processing trillions of messages every day. This also means that to power our many use cases, we have successfully pushed some of Kafka’s boundaries. We are aware of the ongoing development and proposals within the Kafka community, and we further find that some of our ideas, such as abstracting out the …</p></div></div></div>

August 3, 2020 | https://www.codesections.com/blog/leaving-netlify/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.codesections.com/blog/leaving-netlify/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
    
  
  <p>I'm very strongly considering moving this site away from Netlify.  In fact, I'd go so far as saying that I'm planning to unless writing this post—or hearing from y'all—changes my mind.</p>
<p>Before I launch into why, though, I want to clarify: I've been very happy with Netlify.  They've delivered exactly what they promised: fast, free, static hosting backed by a global CDN.  Deploying is as easy as running <code>git push</code> in the terminal; if you're thinking about using them, you probably shouldn't let this post dissuade you.</p>
<p>So, given all those positives, why am I still thinking about migrating the site?</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-my-complexity-budget">The Problem: My Complexity Budget</h2>
<p>Basically, I'm starting to feel that my site is more complex than is justified by how simple my goals are.  Serving this simple, static site involves three separate CDNs: Netlify has their own CDN, they use the Akamai CDN, and they serve images from Amazon's Cloudfront CDN.  That's a lot of interconnected systems to depend on, and I could see it making debugging performance issues harder.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, I haven't <em>had</em> any performance issues, so maybe I'm borrowing trouble by thinking through debugging them?)</p>
<p>Somewhat relatedly, I'm not <em>thrilled</em> with the idea that Amazon is involved in serving my site—there's not a <em>ton</em> they can do with data from serving images (there aren't any cookies on my site, for example) but it does still feed a bit more data their way.</p>
<p>Perhaps more concretely, the complexity inherent in Netlify's setup means that I can't access simple server logs.  I'm a bit curious about how many readers my various posts get, but I've been reluctant to add any JavaScript tracking to my site.  I flatly refuse to add Google Analytics—the privacy implications are just too extreme.  I've considered adding <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, but Fathom <a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/issues/40">still uses cookies</a> and has tagged the issue requesting a change with <code>wontfix</code>.  Besides, self-hosting Fathom actually be <em>more</em> complex than just hosting the site itself: their recommended installation procedure involves installing Fathom, Postgres, and Nginx.  (In contrast, since the site is built into flat files, it can be hosted without a database—all it would need is Nginx).</p>
<p>That's just one example, of course, but it brings something into focus: using Netlify for hosting means buying in to their system—if something (here, accessing logs) isn't supported by their API, then there's just not anything you can do about it.  And there's no long-term guarantee that their API won't change in ways that might impact me; after all, I'm not a paying customer.  I wouldn't even blame them if they change their service in a way that hurts me at the expense of the people actually paying to keep the lights on (or, more to the point, paying to deliver the sort of returns their venture-capitalist investors expect).</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-a-simple-vps">The Solution: A Simple VPS</h2>
<p>The solution to all this is simple (or, The solution to all this is simplicity).  Since the site is just static files, I could throw it up behind a super simple Nginx server on basically any VPS.  (I'd probably go with Digital Ocean, but the point is that I could move it anywhere if DO didn't work out—it'd be simple enough to work with any server rather than tied into a specific API).  I could even roll my own server in Rust, which I've tested as providing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a82w9b/can_a_rust_web_server_beat_nginx_in_serving/">similar performance to Nginx</a>.  Though if I went that route, I'd need to add in my own logging).</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-the-solution-global-speed">The Problem with The Solution: Global Speed</h2>
<p>I really love the idea of moving to simplicity, but there's one hangup.  All those CDNs Netlify was running my site through <em>did</em> have a purpose—they allow my site's assets to be served globally.  This doesn't much matter for visitors located near me—ironically enough, running <code>tracepath</code> showed that my site is <em>already</em> served from Digital Ocean servers for visitors from my location, so it wouldn't matter <em>at all</em>.  But my site currently (according to <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">webpagetest.org</a>, anyway) has essentially the same performance in Mumbai that it has in the U.S.  And I'd give that up if I hosted from a single server.</p>
<p>Of course, there are ways I could add a CDN back into my site—but that would be adding back in some of the complexity that I'm stripping away.  And doing so in a privacy-respecting way would probably get a bit pricy.</p>
<p>So, at least for the short term, I think I'd probably just accept that ditching Netlify would mean accepting slower site speeds for visitors that are half a world a way.  I <em>think</em> that trade off is worth it, but I feel bad saying so given that <em>I</em> wouldn't be the one dealing with the slower load times.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's what I'm thinking at the moment.  But I'm open to changing my mind—please let me know if I'm thinking about this all wrong.</p>

<p>An operating system is used to make our job easier when using graphics. In our instance, in addition to everything else. In this post, we will be writing a GPU (graphics processing unit) driver using the VirtIO specification. In here, we will allow user applications to have a portion of the screen as RAM–with what is commonly known as a <em>framebuffer</em>.</p>



<hr>

<hr>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>



<p>We command the virtual GPU (virtio-gpu) by sending certain commands to the host (the device). The guest (the OS driver) has an allocation of RAM that becomes the framebuffer. The driver then tells the device, “hey, here’s the RAM that we’re going to use to store pixel information.”</p>



<p>The RAM is contiguous in our OS, but according to the specification, this isn’t strictly required. We will give the driver a rectangle. Everything that falls within that rectangle will be copied to the host. We don’t want to keep copying the entire buffer over and over again.</p>



<p>We will be using the virtio protocol that we used for the block driver here, so I won’t rehash the general virtio protocol. However, the device-specific structures are a bit different, so we’ll cover that part more in depth.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="pixels">Pixels and Resolution</h2>



<p>A framebuffer must be large enough to store \(\text{width}\times\text{height}\times\text{pixel size}\) number of bytes. There are \(\text{width}\times\text{height}\) number of pixels. Each pixel has a 1-byte red, green, blue, and alpha channels. So, each pixel is exactly 4 bytes with the configuration we’re going to specify.</p>



<p>The framebuffer for our junior GPU driver is going to support a fixed resolution of \(640\times 480\). If you’re a child of the 90s, you saw this resolution a lot. In fact, my first computer, a Laser Pal 386, had a 16-color monitor with a resolution of 640 pixels wide with 480 pixels tall.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png"><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png" alt="" width="458" height="281" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png 611w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px"></a></figure></div>



<p>There are red, green, and blue pixels so close together that by varying the intensity of these three channels, we can change the color. The closer we get to our monitors, the easier a pixel is to see.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png"><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png" alt="" width="285" height="288" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png 380w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14-297x300.png 297w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px"></a><figcaption>Pixels on a Viewsonic VX2770SMH-LED monitor.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can see these little squares. If you squint enough, you can see that they aren’t pure white. Instead, you can see bits of red, blue, and green. That’s because each one of these little squares is subdivided into three colors: yep, red, green, and blue! To make white, these pixels are turned up to 11 (get the joke?). To make black, we turn off all three channels of that pixel.</p>



<p>The resolution refers to how many of these squares are on our monitor. This is a 1920×1080 monitor. That means that there are 1920 of these squares going left to right, and there are 1080 of these squares from top to bottom. All in all, we have \(1920\times 1080=2,073,600\) number of pixels. Each one of these pixels is expressed using 4 bytes in the framebuffer, meaning we need \(2,073,600\times 4=8,294,400\) bytes in RAM to store the pixel information.</p>



<p>You can see why I limited our resolution to 640×480, which only requires \(640\times 480\times 4=1,228,800\) bytes–a bit over a megabyte.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="virtio">The GPU VirtIO Device</h2>



<p>The GPU device requires us to read a more up-to-date VirtIO specification. I’ll be reading from version 1.1, which you can get a copy here: <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html">https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html</a>. Specifically, chapter 5.7 “GPU Device”. This is an <em>unaccelerated</em> 2D device, meaning that we must use the CPU to actually form the framebuffer, then we transfer our CPU formulated memory location to the host GPU, which is then responsible for drawing it to the screen.</p>



<p>The device uses a request/response system, where we the driver make a command to request something from the host (the GPU).  We add a bit of extra memory into our request so that the host can formulate its response. When the GPU interrupts us, we can take a look at this response memory location to see what the GPU told us. This is much like the <em>status</em> field on the block driver, where the block device tells us the status of our last request.</p>



<p>Each request starts with a <em>Command Header</em>, which in Rust looks as follows:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(C)]
struct CtrlHeader {
	ctrl_type: CtrlType,
	flags: u32,
	fence_id: u64,
	ctx_id: u32,
	padding: u32
}</pre>



<p>The header is common for all requests and all responses. We can differentiate by the CtrlType enumeration, which is:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(u32)]
enum CtrlType {
	/* 2d commands */
	CmdGetDisplayInfo = 0x0100,
	CmdResourceCreate2d,
	CmdResourceUref,
	CmdSetScanout,
	CmdResourceFlush,
	CmdTransferToHost2d,
	CmdResourceAttachBacking,
	CmdResourceDetachBacking,
	CmdGetCapsetInfo,
	CmdGetCapset,
	CmdGetEdid,
	/* cursor commands */
	CmdUpdateCursor = 0x0300,
	CmdMoveCursor,
	/* success responses */
	RespOkNoData = 0x1100,
	RespOkDisplayInfo,
	RespOkCapsetInfo,
	RespOkCapset,
	RespOkEdid,
	/* error responses */
	RespErrUnspec = 0x1200,
	RespErrOutOfMemory,
	RespErrInvalidScanoutId,
	RespErrInvalidResourceId,
	RespErrInvalidContextId,
	RespErrInvalidParameter,
}</pre>



<p>I took this directly from the specification, but Rust-ified the names to avoid getting yelled at by the linter.</p>



<h3>Pixel Formats</h3>



<p>Recall that the framebuffer is just a bunch of bytes in memory. We need to put a structure behind the framebuffer so the host (the GPU) knows how to interpret your sequence of bytes. There are several formats, but all-in-all, they just re-arrange the red, green, blue, and alpha channels. All are exactly 4 bytes, which makes the <em>stride</em> the same. The stride is the spacing from one pixel to another–4 bytes.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(u32)]
enum Formats {
	B8G8R8A8Unorm = 1,
	B8G8R8X8Unorm = 2,
	A8R8G8B8Unorm = 3,
	X8R8G8B8Unorm = 4,
	R8G8B8A8Unorm = 67,
	X8B8G8R8Unorm = 68,
	A8B8G8R8Unorm = 121,
	R8G8B8X8Unorm = 134,
}</pre>



<p>The type, <em>unorm</em>, is an 8-bit (1-byte) unsigned value from 0 through 255, where 0 represents no intensity and 255 represents full intensity, and a number in between is a linear-interpolation between no and full intensity. Since there are three color (and one alpha), that gives us \(256\times 256\times 256=16,776,216\) different colors or levels of colors.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I selected <code>R8G8B8A8Unorm = 67</code>, which has red first, green second, blue third, and alpha fourth. This is a common ordering, so I’ll select it to make it easy to follow along.</p>



<p>Our selected format makes the pixel structure look as follows:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21.png"><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1024x614.png" alt="" width="512" height="307" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1024x614.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-300x180.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-768x461.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1536x921.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-2048x1228.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Recall that each individual component R, G, B, and A are each one byte a piece, so each Pixel referred to by (x, y) is 4 bytes. This is why our memory pointer is a Pixel structure instead of a byte.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="init">Initialization</h2>



<p>Just like all other virtio devices, we set up the virtqueues first and then we work on device-specific initialization. In my code, I just directly copied-and-pasted from the block driver into the gpu driver. The only thing I added to the Device structure was the framebuffer and dimensions of the framebuffer.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">pub struct Device {
	queue:        *mut Queue,
	dev:          *mut u32,
	idx:          u16,
	ack_used_idx: u16,
	framebuffer:  *mut Pixel,
	width:        u32,
	height:       u32,
}</pre>



<p>The specification tells us to do the following in order to initialize the device and get things ready to draw. I Rust-ified some of the content to match our enumerations.</p>



<h4>Create a framebuffer and configure scanout</h4>



<ol><li>Create a host resource using <code>CmdResourceCreate2d</code>.</li><li>Allocate a framebuffer from guest ram, and attach it as backing storage to the resource just created, using <code>CmdResourceAttachBacking</code>.</li><li>Use <code>CmdSetScanout</code> to link the framebuffer to a display scanout.</li></ol>



<h3>A Request Structure</h3>



<p>Recall that our request and response come packaged together. We will put them in separate descriptors, but whenever we get a response back from the device, it is going to be easier if we free just once to free both the request and response. So, in Rust, I created the Request structure to support doing this.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">struct Request&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; {
	request: RqT,
	response: RpT,
}
impl&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; Request&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; {
	pub fn new(request: RqT) -&gt; *mut Self {
		let sz = size_of::&lt;RqT&gt;() + size_of::&lt;RpT&gt;();
		let ptr = kmalloc(sz) as *mut Self;
		unsafe {
			(*ptr).request = request;
		}
		ptr
	}
}</pre>



<h4>Step 1: Create host resource</h4>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let rq = Request::new(ResourceCreate2d {
	hdr: CtrlHeader {
		ctrl_type: CtrlType::CmdResourceCreate2d,
		flags: 0,
		fence_id: 0,
		ctx_id: 0,
		padding: 0,
	},
	resource_id: 1,
	format: Formats::R8G8B8A8Unorm,
	width: dev.width,
	height: dev.height,
});
let desc_c2d = Descriptor {
	addr: unsafe { &amp;(*rq).request as *const ResourceCreate2d as u64 },
	len: size_of::&lt;ResourceCreate2d&gt;() as u32,
	flags: VIRTIO_DESC_F_NEXT,
	next: (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16,
};
let desc_c2d_resp = Descriptor {
	addr: unsafe { &amp;(*rq).response as *const CtrlHeader as u64 },
	len: size_of::&lt;CtrlHeader&gt;() as u32,
	flags: VIRTIO_DESC_F_WRITE,
	next: 0,
};
unsafe {
	let head = dev.idx;
	(*dev.queue).desc[dev.idx as usize] = desc_c2d;
	dev.idx = (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16;
	(*dev.queue).desc[dev.idx as usize] = desc_c2d_resp;
	dev.idx = (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16;
	(*dev.queue).avail.ring[(*dev.queue).avail.idx as usize % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE] = head;
	(*dev.queue).avail.idx = (*dev.queue).avail.idx.wrapping_add(1);
}</pre>



<p>All we’re really telling the GPU here is our resolution and the format of the framebuffer. When we create this, the host gets to configure itself, such as allocating an identical buffer to make transfers from our OS.</p>



<h4>Step 2: Attach framebuffer backing.</h4>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let rq = Request3::new(AttachBacking {
	hdr: CtrlHeader {
		ctrl_type: CtrlType::CmdResourceAttachBacking,
		flags: 0,
		fence_id: 0,
		ctx_id: 0,
		padding: 0,
	},
	resource_id: 1,
	nr_entries: 1,
},
MemEntry {
	addr: dev.framebuffer as u64,
	length: dev.width * dev.height * size_of::&lt;Pixel&gt;() as u32,
	…</pre></div></div></div>

<div>
  
  <p><span>Aug 3 2020</span></p><p>One of the things I’ve wanted to do for a while is really dig into
assembly and get into the weeds of how programs actually run.
A rework of the <code>asm</code> macro has <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/06/08/new-inline-asm.html">recently landed</a> in nightly rust
so it seemed like a good time.</p>

<p>And compared to some other ways I’ve tried to approach this there’s a lot less
setup we need to do if we just use the <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018">rust playground</a> to
do all the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>My process for figuring things out has been pretty simple.
I write a tiny bit of rust code, look at the assembly output
and try to figure out what’s going on (with lots of googling).
I’m going to walk you through what I did, and what I figured
out.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest possible thing I can think of:</p>

<pre><code>fn main() {
    1 + 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=9500bb2bc3f638a4dd89e81fecafac0e">playground link</a></p>

<p>You can get the assembly output for this by clicking the three dots next to
<code>run</code> and selecting <code>asm</code> from the dropdown. You will probably also want
to change the flavour (often referred to as syntax elsewhere) of assembly to intel (rather than at&amp;t) <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
if it isn’t already, by clicking the toggle under the <code>config</code> menu.</p>

<p>The assembly output from this in debug mode is far more massive than you’d expect -
I get 157 lines. And most of it isn’t our program. The code we’ve written should
be fairly easy to find though, as the compiler helpfully labels all of the functions
with their crate and function names. In this case since we’re in the playground,
the create is implicitly <code>playground</code>, so we can find our code by searching with
<code>ctrl-f</code> for <code>playground::main</code>. Doing this gets me to:</p>

<pre><code>playground::main: # @playground::main
# %bb.0:
    ret
                                        # -- End function
</code></pre>

<p>So even though this is a debug build, evidently there’s still some optimization going on,
since there’s no numbers or anything that looks like it’s adding them together.
All that’s happening here is we’re returning (<code>ret</code>) back to the function that called <code>playground::main</code>.
Everything prefixed with <code>#</code> is a comment, and therefore ignored when we run this code.</p>

<p>The only other point of interest is the label <code>playground::main:</code> - anything suffixed with <code>:</code>
is a label we can jump to with various commands, and indeed if we continue searching for <code>playground::main</code>
we can find a rather indirected call to it in <code>main</code>. Hopefully by the end of this we’ll be understand that!</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-optimizations">Avoiding optimizations</h3>

<p>For now, let’s try and evade whatever’s doing the optimization:</p>

<pre><code>fn add() -&gt; usize {
    1 + 2
}

fn main() {
    add();
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=e06e9c1a6771d850be5e06abc6f70243">playground link</a></p>

<p>Again, searching for <code>playground::main</code> get us to:</p>

<pre><code>playground::add: # @playground::add
# %bb.0:
    mov eax, 3
    ret
                                        # -- End function

playground::main: # @playground::main
# %bb.0:
    push    rax
    call    playground::add
# %bb.1:
    pop rax
    ret
                                        # -- End function
</code></pre>

<p>So we’ve got a bit more progress here. Still some optimization going on, since we don’t see 1 or 2 in the code,
just 3. We can see that being moved (<code>mov</code>) into the <code>eax</code> register in <code>playground::add</code>.
This must be how we’re returning the value back up to <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>And indeed, inside <code>main</code> we can see <code>push rax</code> - saving the value in the register <code>rax</code> to the stack, then a
call to our <code>add</code> function, then we <code>pop rax</code> off the stack. The <code>push call pop</code> sequence is to preserve
whatever values are in the registers used in <code>add</code>. It also just throws away the value we saved in <code>eax</code> in <code>add</code>,
because <code>eax</code> and <code>rax</code> are the same register. The table <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#General-Purpose_Registers_(GPR)_-_16-bit_naming_conventions">here</a>
shows how ‘skinnier’ registers overlap with their ‘wider’ counterparts.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-optimizations-take-2">Avoiding optimizations, take 2</h3>

<p>So how can we make this actually do some math? Let’s try again:</p>

<pre><code>fn add(i: usize) -&gt; usize {
    1 + i
}

fn main() {
    add(2);
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=0d821a33f2375ecaf3671c825a415c83">playground link</a></p>

<p>So we’ve got a lot more going on this time:</p>

<pre><code>playground::add: # @playground::add
# %bb.0:
    sub rsp, 24
    mov qword ptr [rsp + 16], rdi
    add rdi, 1
    setb al
    test al, 1
    mov qword ptr [rsp + 8], rdi # 8-byte Spill
    jne .LBB8_2
# %bb.1:
    mov rax, qword ptr [rsp + 8] # 8-byte Reload
    add rsp, 24
    ret

.LBB8_2:
    lea rdi, [rip + str.0]
    lea rdx, [rip + .L__unnamed_2]
    mov rax, qword ptr [rip + core::panicking::panic@GOTPCREL]
    mov esi, 28
    call rax
    ud2
                                        # -- End function

playground::main: # @playground::main
# %bb.0:
    push rax
    mov edi, 2
    call playground::add
# %bb.1:
    pop rax
    ret
                                        # -- End function
</code></pre>

<p>The thing we were actually trying to produce is finally in there!
We can see <code>add rdi, 1</code> in the output, surrounded by a pile of other
stuff. So what is all this other code?</p>

<p>Let’s start from the top of the call stack in <code>main</code>.
First we can see <code>2</code> is stored in the <code>edi</code> register
before we call <code>playground::add</code>, so we know our argument must be in
the <code>edi</code> register. Again, we can see the <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code> on <code>rax</code>, so that
must be the return value.</p>

<h3 id="looking-inside-the-function">Looking inside the function</h3>

<p>Now, looking into <code>playground::add</code> we first see <code>sub rsp, 24</code>. <code>rsp</code> is
the register that holds the stack pointer, so this is growing the stack
(since the stack grows downwards in x86<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>). Further down we can see
we shrink the stack by the corresponding amount with <code>add rsp, 24</code>.</p>

<p>Then we have <code>mov qword ptr [rsp + 16], rdi</code>. This is copying the
value from <code>rdi</code> onto the stack at <code>rsp + 16</code> - the top of the region we just grew the stack by.
The <code>qword ptr</code> (quadword (i.e. 64bit) pointer) bit is a hint to disambiguate the argument.
Why is that pushed that onto the stack? I <em>think</em> this is just to make it easier to debug,
since we don’t ever access that value again.</p>

<p>In any case, we then proceed on to actually adding 1 to <code>rdi</code>.
The value is stored back in <code>rdi</code>, and importantly for what comes next,
we may set some of the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#EFLAGS_Register">flags</a>.</p>

<p>Then it gets complicated again - we’ve got <code>setb al</code>. All of the <code>set*</code>
<a href="https://github.com/HJLebbink/asm-dude/wiki/SETcc">instructions</a>
deal with the flag register. The flag register is possibly the most magical
of registers, since it’s manipulated by a bunch of instructions as a side effect.</p>

<p>The last instruction we ran was <code>add</code>, which sets 6 of the the flags:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag">carry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_flag">parity</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjust_flag">adjust (aka auxiliary carry)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_flag">zero</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_flag">sign</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overflow_flag">overflow</a></p>

<p>In this case we’re checking if the carry bit is set, and then setting the <code>al</code>
register to 1 if that’s the case. What is this actually doing though?
The carry bit gets set to 1 if there is a <code>carry</code> from the two numbers we add,
meaning the resulting number is too big to be stored in the register.
What should we do in that case? Let’s read on to find out.</p>

<p>Then in the next line (<code>test al, 1</code>) we’re checking if the value in <code>al</code> is equal to one.
(<code>test</code> does a a bitwise and operation on the two arguments - like <code>&amp;</code> in rust.)
This sets some more flags, notably the <code>zero</code> flag, which is then read by the following <code>jne</code> instruction.</p>

<p><code>jne</code> stands for jump if not equal (and again there’s a series of
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Control_Flow#Jump_Instructions">other</a>
<code>j*</code> instructions). Since it uses flags, it just takes a single argument: where to jump to.</p>

<p>Looking at where that jumps to gives us a big hint about the intent of the
logic above: <code>core::panicking::panic@GOTPCREL</code> really gives it away.
Basically all of this chunk of assembly from <code>setb</code> to <code>jne</code> is checking if we’ve overflowed
the register and panicking if we have.</p>

<p>The one bit we didn’t discuss is <code>mov qword ptr [rsp + 8], rdi # 8-byte Spill</code>.
As the comment implies this is “spilling” the value from the <code>rdi</code> register
onto the stack, since the code we’re possibly about to jump to might
overwrite that register - immediately after the <code>jne</code> we load the value back off
the stack.</p>

<p>Finally we shuffle the stack pointer back to it’s starting point, and <code>ret</code>
back to the caller. <code>ret</code> uses the last value on the stack (which is pushed by <code>call</code>)
to figure out where to jump back to, so moving the stack pointer back is <em>very</em> important.</p>

<p>So maybe at this point we’ve seen enough to take a stab at replacing the guts of the <code>add</code>
function with the <code>asm!</code> macro. Since we’re interested in performance,
we’ll ignore those pesky overflow checks, and just assume that we’re within the bounds of <code>u64</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest new thing we’ll have to deal with here is specifying the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> registers.
The <a href="https://github.com/Amanieu/rfcs/blob/inline-asm/text/0000-inline-asm.md#guide-level-explanation">rfc</a>
has a very approachable explaination of these, so I’d recommend reading that.
There’s a skeleton you can start with <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=d511cf5e95ba5cdfbcffaebaf5f72300">here</a>,
if you want to have a go yourself.</p>

<p>The version I’ve cooked up looks like <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=669b4155a1d818cc5c73b117b9454d48">this</a>.
This is probably the “fanciest” possible version of this, since we’re using as many features of the asm macro as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>we’re letting the rust compiler pick the register we use, and then writing it in using the
<a href="https://github.com/Amanieu/rfcs/blob/inline-asm/text/0000-inline-asm.md#inputs-and-outputs"><code>format</code> string behaviour</a> of the <code>asm</code> macro.</li>
<li>we’re also using <a href="https://github.com/Amanieu/rfcs/blob/inline-asm/text/0000-inline-asm.md#late-output-operands"><code>inlateout</code></a> to
hint that we can just use a single register.</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems like a reasonable point at which to break. We’ve covered a reasonable chunk of the instruction set in x64 assembly,
and seen examples of most of the classes of instructions. There’s tons more we can explore, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do loops work?</li>
<li>What happens when we use values that don’t just fit in registers?</li>
<li>How do we make a syscall?</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully the resources I’ve linked to from here are sufficent for you to continue digging in if you want,
and maybe I’ll manage to follow this up.</p>

        <p> 2020/08/02 </p>
        
<p>tldr; Unified function calling syntax (UFCS) is useful and elegant. I’ve implemented a variant of UFCS that resembles C#’s “extension methods”, in Clang, which you can check out at <a href="https://github.com/dancrn/llvm-project">https://github.com/dancrn/llvm-project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>Proposals for UFCS in C++ has been a somewhat perennial discussion (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1585.pdf">N1585</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4165.pdf">N4165</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4174.pdf">N4174</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4474.pdf">N4474</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0079r0.pdf">P0079R0</a>), with seemingly positive discussion from many, including both Herb Sutter and Bjarne Stroustrup. C# has a take on UFCS called extension methods, and personally, I’ve found them to be overwhelmingly useful. If you’re unfamiliar C#’s extension methods, they look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Extensions</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>string</span> <span>ValueOrDefault</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>string</span> <span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span> <span>defaultValue</span><span>)</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>String</span><span>.</span><span>IsNullOrWhiteSpace</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>switch</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>true</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>defaultValue</span><span>,</span>
      <span>false</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>input</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>GetValue</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>ValueOrDefault</span><span>(</span><span>"No value provided"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Extension methods, when invoked, look like first class methods on the type they are defined on. The example provided doesn’t have much benefit over the existing free-form call (i.e. <code>Extensions.ValueOrDefault(str, "nothing")</code> - and this still is also a valid way of calling that method). However, static extension methods come into their own when viewed as generic approaches to extending already existing classes that cannot be modified. One such C# library is <a href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext">LanguageExt</a>, which provides functional extensions to the base <code>IEnumerable</code> interface (amongst <em>many</em> other things), although there are a lot of other examples that extend other commonly used libraries.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whilst proposals resurface every once in a while, activity on unified call syntax seem to have stagnated. I want to see what it takes to implement it, and who knows, if enough people like and use UFCS, it might make it into.. C++30, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="ufcs-models">UFCS models</h2>
<p><a href="https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/04/13/ufcs-history/">Revzin</a> has an excellent couple of articles that describe UFCS more generally. Essentially, UFCS can be split into two categories of behaviors: “candidate set” functionality describes which functions are considered for a particular invocation style, and “overload resolution” approaches that describe how to determine which member or function should be chosen when there is more than one candidate. Without repeating those descriptions, this model can be considered to be CS4 - the addition of syntax to indicate UFCS candidacy - and OR2 - perform overload resolution as normal with all candidates. I wont spend too much time going into why I’ve made these choices, but briefly:</p>

<h2 id="choice-of-cs4">Choice of CS4</h2>
<p>Whilst not strictly the “most pure” decision, I think that it’s sensible to allow users to specify which functions they intend to be used in overload resolution. And, whilst not <em>strictly</em> speaking a priority, keeping the candidate set as small as possible would be beneficial from the perspective of compilation times. It also allows UFCS to be backward compatible with existing code, means that I think this is the most sensible approach to take.</p>

<h3 id="ufcs-syntax-additions">UFCS syntax additions</h3>
<p>There are two obvious ways of using the <code>this</code> keyword to indicate UFCS candidacy, as a parameter qualifier, or as a parameter name - for anyone familiar with C#, it’s clear that CS4, along with a <code>this</code> parameter qualifier was style chosen when implementing its idea of UFCS. There are many sensible choices for syntax additions, but these where two I considered. These both look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 1. 'this' parameter name</span>
<span>int</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>this</span><span>);</span>

<span>// 2. 'this' qualifier</span>
<span>int</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>param</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are some drawbacks to option 1.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The implicit <code>this</code> value generally has access to private &amp; protected members of a class, members that UFCS functions would not have access to.</li>
  <li>The parameter type was chosen to demonstrate an inconsistency: <code>this</code>, when used in a member function is generally considered to be a pointer, i.e., we use <code>this-&gt;value</code> rather than <code>this.value</code>. What should we accept for UFCS functions?</li>
</ul>

<p>The alternative has a couple of (admittedly smaller) issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UFCS candidacy is most easily seen as a is a property of a function, not a parameter - why change the parameter?</li>
  <li><code>this</code> is a keyword that generally represents a value, and whilst C++ has repurposed keywords before - <code>auto</code> - this might not be desirable.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, the first option seemed to present more questions than it answered, so I opted for the second alternative.</p>

<h3 id="choice-of-or2">Choice of OR2</h3>
<p>I think the worst case scenario for UFCS would be one where the member functions of a class change, masking a UFCS call in a another part of the code that interacts with values of that type. For instance, consider the following case:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// from include &lt;some/library.h&gt;,</span>
<span>// context is defined with a single "read from file" function.</span>
<span>class</span> <span>context</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>read_from_fd</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// and in consuming code, has the following extension defined</span>
<span>int</span> <span>read_from_file</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>context</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>FILE</span> <span>*</span><span>fp</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, the library is updated to a later version, which includes its own <code>read_from_file</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// from include &lt;some/library.h&gt;,</span>
<span>class</span> <span>context</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>read_from_fd</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd</span><span>);</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>read_from_file</span><span>(</span><span>FILE</span> <span>*</span><span>fp</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// this function can only be used with regular function call syntax</span>
<span>int</span> <span>read_from_file</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>context</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>FILE</span> <span>*</span><span>fp</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Preferring member calls over UFCS calls in this case would silently change behaviour of this code, without any obvious change to the <code>read_from_file</code> method. Broadly speaking, I don’t think it’s sensible to prefer one type of call over the other, so this would seem to rule out any form of overload resolution that has preference for one type of call over the other. Therefore OR1 and OR2+ don’t seem like the best approaches, and the choice of CS4 rules out OR3 from being an option. In my implementation, any ambiguity between calls is treated as an error, as it is now.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the choice of OR2 is in contrast with C#’s extension methods, where, in the case of ambiguity between a UFCS candidate and a member function, the member function is always chosen (i.e., C# uses OR2+).</p>

<h2 id="ufcs-for-c">UFCS for C++</h2>
<p>In summary, the following is what I’m going to be implementing:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>this</code> precedes the declaration specifiers (<code>const</code>, <code>volatile</code>, etc.) of a file/namespace scoped function’s first parameter.</li>
  <li>Class methods cannot be defined to be UFCS candidates (although that could probably be relaxed for non-instance methods).</li>
  <li>Calls of the form <code>x.f(y)</code>, in addition to performing member lookup, also perform name lookup for functions of name <code>f</code>, and overload resolution with arguments <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>.</li>
  <li>Overload resolution proceeds as normal, i.e., if the candidate set contains a class method and a UFCS candidate, then there is no preferential treatment of either, and this is an error.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>
<p>In summary, we will be able to define functions that appear to be methods defined on a class as such:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>private:</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>m_bar</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public:</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>bar</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
  <span>m_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span><span>)</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>get_bar</span><span>()</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>noexcept</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>m_bar</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>get_bar_length</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>val</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>val</span><span>.</span><span>get_bar</span><span>().</span><span>length</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And using these methods looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>f1</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>"pasta"</span><span>);</span>

  <span>// the two calls are semantically identical</span>
  <span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>.</span><span>get_bar_length</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>get_bar_length</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="clang">Clang</h2>
<p>I’ll forgo an introduction to Clang here - I expect any readers will be familiar with it. I’ve been motivated to start with Clang rather than GCC primarily because of Saar Raz’s story on getting behind Clang’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1o4rc9P1FQ">implementation of concepts</a>. In any case, Clang seems like a suitable basis for implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clang is actively maintained with hundreds of contributers,</li>
  <li>code quality in Clang is widely regarded to be clean and consistent,</li>
  <li>acceptance into Clang, if it were to happen, may encourage discussion on UFCS, and</li>
  <li>it could be fun :)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>I started UFCS in clang “for real” in around April of this year, although I had been reading and thinking about it on and off probably since September of 2019. In general I thought the code quality in Clang was decent, and whilst the learning curve was probably the steepest I’ve ever encountered, I was impressed with how little you needed to fully understand to make something work - the code is truly quite modular. That said, getting something working versus something that is complete requires understanding very large regions of code. Parsing C++ is what a lot of people would consider to be exotic, and so small changes in one place can have effects in places that you would not expect.</p>

<p>As it stands, I have a working implementation that passes all the tests in <code>make clang-test</code>. Of course, ‘Parse’ and ‘SemaCXX’ tests have been added, <code>cxx-ufcs.cpp</code> and <code>unified-call-syntax.cpp</code> respectively. I’ve added appropriate additional diagnostic messages (albeit as parser errors, rather than semantic analysis errors), though there are some others that I would like to add in. I’ve tested my custom version of Clang on a few projects, and it seems to work as expected, too. Overall, I’m quite satisfied with how it’s turned out, and I (naively) hope someone other than myself will give it a go :)</p>

<h3 id="using-ufcs">Using UFCS</h3>
<p>If you want to try UFCS, then you can checkout and build Clang from <a href="https://github.com/dancrn/llvm-project">here</a>, there’s nothing extra to configure (although I recommend you don’t install it in the default prefix!). To enable UFCS, you’ll need to pass an additional argument to Clang when invoking it, <code>-fufcs</code>. The front end driver hasn’t been changed at all, so you’ll most likely need to pass it through to the compiler manually:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> $ /path/to/clang -Xclang -fufcs file.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, given the design of this implementation, there shouldn’t be any issues with compiling existing code. If this is not a case, then feel free to create an issue on GitHub!</p>

<h2 id="remaining-work">Remaining Work</h2>
<p>Whilst I’m moderately confident that my changes work as intended, I do not consider this to be “done”. There are a few things that feel not quite right, and, even if this is never merged into clang (which …</p></div></div></div>

02 Aug 2020

</span></p><p>I joined Roblox at the end of 2012 as a rendering engineer; I had just spent more than a year working on various titles from FIFA franchise after years of console game development and was becoming a bit tired of the “big game development”. My work on FIFA was as a contractor and I got an offer for a full-time position, but I also had a friend who worked at Roblox reach out and offer me to move to California and work on Roblox. I knew absolutely nothing about Roblox, but California was nice and my friend told me it would be awesome. The platform was so different (and so strange!) that I decided to take a chance - here I am, 8 years later, still working at Roblox and enjoying it. I started on my first full time job in April 2007 so at this point I’ve worked for 13 years in game development and 8 of them were at Roblox.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My memory works in interesting ways. I remember my interview pretty well, I remember having lunch at some place in San Mateo downtown near the Roblox HQ - a few people were at lunch including Roblox CEO David Baszucki and I remember him asking many questions about my thoughts about the engines and rendering, and distinctly remember not finishing most of my lunch because I talked most of the time. However I don’t really remember what was going through my head in regards to my perception of Roblox - why did I join besides just thinking I want to do something else for a change? Who knows, but I am glad I did.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Roblox is so successful - you can invent all sorts of reasons in retrospect but it’s hard to validate them, and if you came to anybody back in 2012 and asked for an investment to build a platform where all games are user generated and run on a custom engine with a custom toolset and all users participate in a giant virtual economy and …, I think you’d have gotten a blank stare.</p>

<p>But I do understand that I found the perfect place for me, especially at that point in my career - I enjoy working on game technology but I never liked working on actual games, and Roblox maximizes the number of developers who can use the technology you work on while maintaining a good autonomy and a very wide range of problems you’d need to solve. It’s very hard to get bored here.</p>

<p>I think I could talk for hours about Roblox - it somehow became a huge part of my life. I was very fortunate to join at the time when I did and witness the growth of our technology and business. I am really unsure of what the future holds but it’s hard to imagine what, if anything, comes after Roblox - I certainly don’t intend to leave any time soon…</p>

<p>So I thought it might be fun to do what I’ve planned to do for a year or more now, and to go over all decently sized projects I’ve ever worked on at Roblox. This is based on resummarizing and reliving the source control history, which tells me I’ve had 2752 changes that made it to our main branch, with merge commits counting as one, so, uh, this blog might be on a larger side. Hopefully this will be fun!</p>

<p>Before we begin, I just want to conclude this by saying that I’m very grateful to the Roblox leadership for treating me well, for all the friends and colleagues I made along the way, and for the wonderful Roblox community. The reason why I still enjoy what I do is because whenever I write about a new big thing I’m working on or a small feature or even a bug fix, it’s usually met with excitement which keeps me going. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I don’t think I could have done it without you and I hope this continues for as long as possible despite the current trying and uncertain times.</p>



<p>Notably including half-pixel offset fixes for Direct3D9 which I guess is a rite of passage for rendering engineers. The rendering code back then was based on OGRE rendering engine, so I had to learn that, and this was also my first time using OpenGL professionally - prior to that I’ve used Direct3D 9 and proprietary console APIs, and Direct3D 10/11 as a hobby.</p>



<p>Initially added for “100 player” project, in October it evolved to render all parts and continued to be used as part renderer until the introduction of instancing in 2018. Otherwise known as “featherweight parts”. This was further optimized and deployed around November 2012. Most of this code survived to this day but evolved over time, and is still used when instancing doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>The core idea in this system was to dynamically batch meshes together, for characters this would be based on the character model hierarchy, and for everything else the grouping is spatial. This allowed us to reduce the number of draw calls, which was a big concern due to both driver overhead and inefficiencies in OGRE.</p>

<p>This would pave the way for what eventually turned out to be a complete, but gradual, rewrite of the rendering stack. The main motivation for this was always performance - what we ended up let us port to mobile (the old rendering code was nowhere near fast enough even for relatively simple scenes), and break new grounds on the number of objects we could render in a frame.</p>



<p>One of a few OGRE upgrades we’ve needed to do, this one was to get better GLES support. It was pretty painful to do those, just like any other big middleware update is. Read further to learn what happened to OGRE eventually…</p>

<p>One thing I remember from doing these is that documentation in source code makes the upgrade process that much more painful. I had scripts that changed the copyright years in headers back to whatever they were in our tree just to make merging less painful, but there was some OGRE upgrade where 70% of the changes were documentation, and this was very hard to get through.</p>

<p>The reason why these were challenging in general is that whenever we did an upgrade we had to a) merge our plentiful changes with the new code, b) gate dangerous parts of the upgrade with flags. We’ve used the same system of feature flags (we call them fast flags) since I joined Roblox which allows us to dynamically disable parts of the release based on metrics, but this requires actually isolating changes behind if statements selectively - which for OGRE was sometimes necessary as we didn’t know what the impact of some low level change in OpenGL code would be.</p>



<p>Before this we had hand-translated shaders, which started to be painful to maintain. The first version of the pipeline used hlsl2glsl and glsl-optimizer (same as Unity back in the day). We are using version 3 today, see below!</p>

<p>Since this was done at the point where we used OGRE, the compiler would take HLSL files, preprocess and translate them to optimized GLSL, and save the resulting GLSL back to disk - which would then be loaded by OGRE directly through the material definition file. Eventually we replaced this with a binary shader pack that could store GLSL code for OpenGL and shader bytecode for other APIs, but back then we shipped HLSL and GLSL source and compiled HLSL code on device!</p>



<p>Our equivalent of “Steam Hardware Survey” that went through SQL databases and coalesced various system information bits to help us understand the hardware at the time. This was during my era of obsession with F#, so it was written in F# instead of something like Python. We don’t use this anymore and don’t even have the SQL database in question!</p>

<p>We never published the resulting data, and I’m not sure how often we used it to make decisions, but it was fun to look at the number of graphics cards from various vendors or amount of RAM or resolution a typical Roblox user has.</p>



<p>Although I was hired as a rendering engineer, I had a lot of really deep low-level systems experience and as a consequence ended up engaging in both optimization work and security related work from the very beginning. I don’t do this anymore these days but I was often involved in the security work for the first 3 or 4 years. Now we fortunately have people who can do this full time and better than I could :)</p>



<p>A second part of “100 player project”, necessary to render every character in one draw call (these were really expensive for us back in the day!). A side effect included some resolution sacrifices on character items that shirt creators aren’t fond of. The new system managed the atlas texture memory, rebaking humanoids far away to smaller textures to conserve texture memory. The compositor survived with minor changes to this day, although we’re now working on a new one.</p>

<p>The compositor was built in a very configurable fashion, allowing the high level code to specify the layout to bake, and managing all the complex asynchronous processing and budgeting by itself. This allowed us to switch the composit layout completely years later for R15.</p>



<p>At the end of 2012 we were actively working on the mobile port. Since then we’ve had to do a lot of work in a lot of different parts of the engine to make data structures smaller and algorithms - faster. Of course you’re never done with optimizations so we do this to this day. Curiously, our minimum spec on iOS stayed the same since the initial launch in 2012!</p>

<p>A fun fact is that even though we started with iPad 2 as the min. spec we discussed adding support to iPad 1 after launch. At the time there were a lot of people who couldn’t play Roblox on iOS on older hardware. However the performance characteristics of those devices were just… not good enough. You could touch the screen with the finger and pan the camera, and during panning you lost 30% of a single available core to the OS processing the touch. We decided to not add support for this, and 8 years later it seems like a great decision for sure :D</p>



<p>It was very hard to use Xcode Instruments to profile frame spikes on an iPad; to try to figure out how to get our performance to a better place on mobile, I wrote some ad-hoc code to dump all internal log events to a binary stream, and a desktop UI tool in F# and WPF to visualize it. This included a Lua profiler as well that could display profiles of Lua code in a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The two primary ways for people to find you on the internet are paid ads and search engines. We discussed paid ads <a href="https://www.entreprenerd.blog/live-streams/marketing-month-week-2">a few weeks ago</a>, now let's talk about search engines.</p><p>"SEO" is Search Engine Optimization - it's how Google and Bing and other search engines can tell whether or not your website should come up when someone searches for something.</p><p>The two main pieces of SEO are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Keywords / Content</li><li>Backlinks</li></ul><p>Keywords are just words and phrases you want to rank for - meaning you show up when someone googles them. For instance, I personally want to rank for words like "entrepreneurship" and phrases like "how to become an entrepreneur." So, if my website is full of articles and videos and information about those words and phrases, I'm more likely to pop up when someone types them into google.</p><p>So, how do you find keywords? I use a tool called <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">ahrefs</a> - it's not free, but it's close. They have "$7 for 7 Days" trial periods, and in order to assemble a solid list of keywords you can use for the next year, you'll really only need those 7 days. (Plus, you can always sign up for more trials using different emails in the future - just REMEMBER TO CANCEL your subscription)</p><p>After you sign up, go to "Keyword explorer" and start typing ideas in. Use each of the tabs on the left under "Keywords Ideas" - and create a list to add any keywords you find that make sense for your brand. Usually, I filter by "KD" (Keyword Difficulty) to anything lower than 25. Beyond 25, unless you're producing an incredible amount of content, you're going to have a lot of trouble.</p><p>After you compile a big fat list of keywords you like, go to the list page and export it to excel so you can use it after your trial period expires. Now you know what to target.</p><p>The next thing is content, and this is where things get to be a black box. Content is just articles and written posts on your website that contain the keywords we compiled. If a big keyword for me is "how to become an entrepreneur" then you bet I'm going to write an article with that title. However, I've talked to a good number of SEO professionals, and the best advice they can give is "Write well." It's tough to know what exactly you should put in your content that makes it rank higher, so the best thing you can do is use proper grammar, make it readable, and do what the title suggests the article will say.</p><p>A few tools I've seen that tend to help content get written well are <a href="http://grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> and <a href="https://www.dashword.com/">Dashword</a>. Grammarly just helps you use proper grammar - it's free and awesome. Dashword is a new tool I found on ProductHunt that seems to help you position keywords nicely in your content so it ranks higher - though I haven't tested it and it is quite expensive.</p><p>So now you're writing content with the right keywords - but there's more you can do. You can use "backlinks" - links from other successful websites - to boost how well your website overall ranks. Basically, if google sees Entrepreneur Magazine (which ranks well in terms of "entrepreneurship" keywords) has an article or two that link to my website, then google will think my website is more important, and rank me higher. </p><p>So, we want other websites to suggest our website as a resource. We can do that by looking up the keywords we want to rank for - just type them in google - and see if any blogs pop up. If you find blogs or websites that rank well, use a simple email finder like <a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a> to find whoever is in charge and reach out to them to ask to write a guest blog post. They get free content, and in the article you get to put a backlink to your website. Some blogs will even have a form just to submit guest post requests.</p><p>Lastly, you can use question-answer websites like <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> to help push traffic in your direction. If, while you're googling your keywords, you find a few questions on Quora or WikiHow that you think you can answer, do it. For instance, if someone asks "what podcasts are great for learning entrepreneurship?" I might answer and reference my live stream content. That provides a backlink on a ranking question, and if people like that answer, they can also find you directly through it.</p><p>Beware, all of this sounds pretty great, but google takes anywhere between 4 to 6 months to actually see what you've created. If you post a bit of content now, you'll have to wait a while for the benefit to actually kick in, and for people to find your website through it. SEO is a long-term investment, so plan accordingly.</p><p>That's pretty much the basics. There are a lot more nuances like making sure your website is structured the right way and how to build your sitemap, but this should be all you need to know to get started!</p><p>If this was helpful at all, a retweet would be amazing. It really helps me spread the word - but of course, no pressure at all! :)</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>February 2020 marked an entire year <a href="https://www.beta-neil.com/posts/goodbye-brightwheel/">since I left my last job</a>. I spent a lot of 2019 thinking about what to do next (a topic for a later blog post), and after many conversations with my wife and extended family, I ultimately decided to get back on the job market.</p>
<p>It had been over 5 years since I last interviewed for a software engineering job, and the idea of getting back into the interviewing game was daunting. My financial and familial obligations gave me about a month to find employment, so I had to spend as much of that time as I could, brushing up on the skills I felt weakest in.</p>
<p>Common software engineering interview practices are <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/lets-stop-with-the-whiteboard-interviews-please-1355a0638087">notoriously bad</a>. Despite that, nearly 90% of engineering interviews always consist of some type of whiteboarding component, so I knew that I had to get stronger at the weakest part of my interviewing game: <em>data structures and algorithms</em>.</p>
<p>I put together a month long curriculum that consisted of 70% data structures and algorithms, 20% system design and 10% practice interviews. During that month, I also made it clear to recruiters on LinkedIn, and sites like Hired, Angellist and Vettery that I was ready to start looking, but wouldn't be available to interview for at least 30 days.</p>
<p>Since I wasn't working full-time, I had the luxury of time to study for 4 hours a day, 6 days a week. My days would mostly be split studying or listening to lectures in the mornings, and doing practice questions via <a href="https://www.beta-neil.com/posts/a-new-job/www.leetcode.com">Leetcode</a> and <a href="https://www.beta-neil.com/posts/a-new-job/www.hackerrank.com">hackerrank</a> in the afternoons. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I'd do a 1 hour practice interview using <a href="https://www.pramp.com/#/">Pramp</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-curriculum">The Curriculum</h3>
<h4 id="data-structures-and-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
<p>I learned how to program as a teenager by modding games and making websites for my friends. I didn't study computer science in college and never had the opportunity to drill data structures and algorithms into my head the way that many computer science undergrads do. I always had some insecurity about my data structures and algorithms weaknesses, so my goal for this round of interviews (aside from getting a job) was to gain enough confidence in my data structures and algorithms so that I would know that I had my bases covered any time I walked into an interview.</p>
<p>My curriculum consisted of two textbooks and a set of online lectures.</p>
<p>The first book and most important book I worked through was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N4EQ1X4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00N4EQ1X4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=neilslist-20&amp;linkId=e8ce19013009469f71b405f4dccb3d67">The Algorithm Design Manual</a> by Steven S. Skiena. This book does an excellent job working through highly complex algorithms and data structures, all while keeping the subject matter rooted in practical applications.</p>
<p>The goal with this book was to read and finish all exercises for at least one chapter each day. On Sundays I'd review my notes and work through 4 - 5 leetcode questions that corresponded to some of the chapters I read in the previous week.</p>
<p>The second book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111941847X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=111941847X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=neilslist-20&amp;linkId=e66f39c5c143fbda7fa33d23fc9e3e3b">Programming Interviews Exposed</a> is a classic. I bought this book during my first year as an engineer, and hadn't read it or practiced with it since at least 2011.</p>
<p>Each chapter in this book is grouped around particular sets of interview problems, all while teaching the concepts that the problems illustrate. The answers to each problem are listed in the book, but in the spirit of learning, it's probably best to try each problem before looking at the answers.</p>
<p>I worked through the exercises in this book using 30 minute timeboxes. If I solved the question faster than 30 minutes, I would attempt to make my algorithm more efficient. If I wasn't able to answer a question within 30 minutes, I would take the opportunity to read through the answer and understand the optimal solutions. I'd then add a similar question to my leetcode questions for the upcoming week, just to make sure I drilled the concepts as much as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, The <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-data-structures/">Easy to Advanced Data Structures Course</a> on Udemy was a great course that I used to reinforce what I was learning via the books that I was reading. The course was well laid out, with easy to understand source code for each lecture and clear animations that showed how each algorithm that we implemented worked.</p>
<h4 id="assessing-weaknesses-with-leetcode">Assessing Weaknesses with LeetCode</h4>
<p>Sunday evenings were spent putting together an overview of what the next week would look like. During my interview prep period, I'd look ahead in both the Programming Interviews Exposed and Algorithm Design Manual, then go to Leetcode and compile a list of 1 - 2 questions that corresponded to each chapter. At the end of each week, I'd work through these questions, and make notes about what topics I found difficult. I'd review each of the challenging topics during the next week.</p>
<p>This process allowed me to continually assess concepts that I was weak in and reinforce those concepts over the course of the month.</p>
<h4 id="working-through-interview-anxiety">Working through Interview Anxiety</h4>
<p>Engineering interviews aren't just challenging because of the material. The environment and the interviewer can often be triggering for those that deal with performance anxiety and imposter syndrome. Earlier in my career, bad interview experiences created major setbacks in my confidence and I often struggled to pick myself up and continue moving forward through the adversity of those experiences.</p>
<p>Pramp helped me ease my interview anxiety. I scheduled two hour long coding interviews each week with other engineers on the platform.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-it-go">How did it go?</h3>
<p>I started interviewing about 26 days into the preparation process. And I'm happy with how the process turned out. I ended up with multiple offers from some great companies, and chose the offer that fit best with what I was looking for. I didn't kill it in every interview, but I did walk into each interview confident and prepared, which is really what I was looking for with this process.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm happy with the outcome of this process. I got a new job, I'm learning a ton about an industry I know very little about, and have a more persistent set of fundamentals that I can fall back on when necessary.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about this process, or have any questions, reach out on twitter, I'm <a href="https://www.beta-neil.com/posts/a-new-job/www.twitter.com/kneelshah">@kneelshah</a>.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, I built a DIY pen plotter (mostly) from scratch. I'd been
meaning to post a build log, because this was one of the more enjoyable hardware
projects I've worked on recently. However, it's taken a while to write-up this
project because, well,

<h2 id="why-build-a-plotter">Why Build a Plotter?</h2>
<p>So, why is it worth building a pen plotter? The short answer is, “they're cool”.
The longer answer is that, despite commercial printers (ink jet, laser, etc.)
working better for general purpose printing, the quality of a pen-plotted image
is noticeably different than something that's been traditionally printed.
Plotted images can have a more natural, organic feeling to them, because they're
produced by raising and lowering a pen manually, like a human does.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I've also had a persistent curiosity with
<a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2019/03/07/Generative-Doodling/">generative art</a>. Much of the community
built around generative art (colloquially,
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter">#plottertwitter</a>) uses pen plotters
to turn “bits into atoms”. While most folks opt to buy a commercial plotter like
the <a href="https://axidraw.com/">Axidraw</a> or restore vintage plotters from the 1980's,
there's a growing community of people building their own plotters.</p>
<h2 id="assembling-the-components">Assembling the Components</h2>
<p>The first step in the project was collecting the bill of materials (BOM).
There's a well-researched BOM on the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/blob/master/Docs/mechanical_BOM.md">project Github</a>.
Other than the midTbot PCB, which is for sale
<a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/33366583/midtbot-esp32-v2-controller-kit/">on Tindie</a>,
I had to order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear shafts and Linear Bearings (Amazon)</li>
<li>Pulleys and Idler Pulleys (Amazon)</li>
<li>Rubber Timing Belt (Amazon)</li>
<li>2 Stepper Motors (Amazon)</li>
<li>Stepper Motor Controllers (Amazon)</li>
<li>12V 3A Power Supply (Already had one)</li>
<li>Basic Hobby Servo Motor (Already had one from previous Arduino projects)</li>
<li>Assorted M3/M5 Head Screws (Home Depot, Ali Express)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised how available most of the parts were online –
everything except for the screws/nuts were available on Amazon.</p>
<p>Once I received my midTbot PCB, there was some soldering and assembly to do. I
followed
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Controller-Kit-Assembly-Instructions">these instructions</a>
to attach the homing switches, power supply, and header pins to the board.</p>
<h3 id="printing-the-chassis">Printing the Chassis</h3>
<p>The chassis of the midTbot is entirely 3D printed. There are ~7 things that you
need to print
(<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/tree/master/STL">source files</a> on
Github), and they're all fairly simple shapes, so the prints were easy to do.</p>
<figure>

        <p>Completed prints of the ‘feet’ and tailblock pieces</p>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The hardest thing to print (and the most finicky part of the project in general)
was the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/blob/master/STL/midt_esp32_pen_mnt.stl">pen mount</a>.
This piece has some overhangs on it, so it was important to configure the
printer to add support material.</p>
<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>
<p>With the PCB assembled, mechanical parts purchased, and chassis pieces printed,
it was time to do the final assembly. Again, I followed the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Assembly-Instructions">assembly instructions</a>
on the project Github.</p>
<p>The assembly process was straightforward: the PCB gets screwed into one of the
printed pieces, the pulleys and linear rods get screwed in to the “feet” and
carriage block pieces, and the stepper motors are secured to the chassis with
the PCB “sandwiched” in between the chassis and the motors.</p>
<p>One difficult step was attaching the stepper motors to the PCB. Per the project
instructions, you're supposed to solder the stepper motor wires into plastic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header">pin sockets</a>, so you can easily
detach the motors from the PCB. But, after I tried and failed several times to
solder the stepper motors into the female socket block, I simply soldered the
female sockets to the board directly and soldered the stepper motor wires onto
solid-core jumper wires. The end result wasn't as clean as what's shown in the
project instructions, but still allowed me to hot-swap the motors if needed.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Once the main “chunk” of the plotter was assembled (pictured above), the only
things left to do were to thread the timing belt around the pulleys, and attach
both ends of the belt to the pen head with a small amount of tension.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/full_plotter2.jpg">

        <p>Belt Attach Points (circled)</p>

    </figure>

<p>The last step in assembly (and, unfortunately the most fiddly part of the whole
process) was attaching the pen holder to the “head” block. The long screw that
makes the joint between the pen holder and “head” block needs to be tuned
meticulously: If the screw is too tight, then the pen can get stuck in the “up”
position – not returning to the “down” position when the servo retracts. On the
other hand, if the screw is too loose, then this translates to “slop” in the
pen's position, which results in wiggly drawings that are unusable.</p>

    </figure>

<p>At this point, the bot was assembled! I powered it on and installed a specific
version of the <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> firmware
designed for the midTbot per the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Compiling-Firmware-for-the-MidTBot">project instructions</a>.
Grbl_Esp32 is a really nifty piece of software: it allows you to upload an run
Gcode (basically, machine readable instructions for how to move the pen) on the
plotter's Esp32 controller. Since the Esp32 has built-in wifi (and bluetooth),
its able to serve a basic web UI:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/webui.png">

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The Web UI is sufficient for most tasks: homing, minor positioning adjustments,
starting/pausing/resuming prints. There are only a few tasks – like calibration
– that require you to drop down to the Grbl “command line”.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get my midTbot calibrated. The project documentation was a
bit light on the specifics, so there was a lot of trial-and-error and
troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="plotting-software">Plotting, Software</h2>
<p>Now that I had a functioning plotter bot, the next thing to do was try it out.
Of course, to do so you need to actually produce Gcode that the bot can use.
There are tons of tools to do this – and a full discussion of Gcode/plotter
software is worth a whole other post. Suffice it to say, there are a variety of
resources on the <a href="https://drawingbots.net/knowledge/tools">Drawing Bots</a>
community page that serve as a good starting point.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time working with <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>‘s
Gcodetools plugin. Axidraw (which makes a commercial pen plotter) also has some
useful
<a href="https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation">Inkscape plugins</a>,
although some of the functionality won't work with the midTbot. Gcodetools
nominally allows you to translate SVGs to Gcode, however this is a tedious
process. <em>Not just any</em> SVG will work well with it; the SVG basically already
needs to be a line drawing for Gcodetools to have any hope of working correctly.
It has basic support for infilled regions too, but again you have to be careful
with it – any slight hiccup, and it produces unusable Gcode.</p>
<p>To be honest, the software aspect of pen plotting is the most frustrating part
of the workflow. I haven't yet found a great toolchain for the “art” -&gt; Gcode
pipeline, so there's a lot of finicky steps. (It doesn't help that Inkscape is a
second-class X11 app on macOS…)</p>
<h2 id="additional-hardware-modifications">Additional Hardware Modifications</h2>
<p>After I ordered a midTbot PCB, the creator added me to a Slack group. Some of
the other folks who'd built midTbots contributed back modifications they'd made
to their builds. I took a couple of these and added them to my bot too:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/pen_mount.jpg">

        <p>Magnetic Pen Mount with Thumb Screw</p>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>First, I ordered heftier thumb screws for the pen attachment (as pictured); the
screws in the original BOM are tricky to manipulate by hand. Second, I printed a
magnetic detachable pen holder (as pictured) which makes it easier to add/remove
pens without disturbing the rest of the setup. If you want to do multicolor
prints, this modification is a must. Finally, I printed wider supports for the
bots frame. Supposedly, this allows you to increase the available print size of
the bot (if you also order longer linear rods). I didn't get around to actually
increasing my bot's print size, but the wider supports made the bot more stable,
and easier to attach to a work table.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>After an afternoon of calibrating the bot and installing the mods I discussed
above, I got some prints that I'm pretty happy with.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/triangle.jpg">
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/triangle_hu7abfc5bba89b65ef467a92e89d404d38_647220_0x400_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="SierpiÅ„ski triangle"> </a><figcaption>

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Sierpinski's triangle (above) is a single line, but has a lot of intricate
detail. This is a good exercise of the precision of the stepper motors, which as
you can see is quite good. The precision also requires the pen mount to be
calibrated correctly, so that there isn't any “slop” between the pen and the
body of the plotter.</p>
<figure>

    </figure>

<p>This was a slightly harder pattern for the bot to draw. The lines are all
straight, but there are a fair number of pen raises. Generally, the more pen
up/down cycles a print has, the greater the likelihood of failure.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that <em>where</em> the pattern is in the print area of the bot makes
a difference. The closer the pen head is to the main bot chassis, the more the
pen is pulled away from the paper due to the counterweight of the “tail”
section. As such, I tried to position the prints as close to the middle of the
print area as possible. Below is what happens when the pen holder misbehaves:</p>

<p>The plot isn't a complete failure, but many of the lines don't get drawn or only
get partially drawn. This is often caused by the pen mount screw being too
tight, causing the pen …</p></div></div>

				<p>In the past several years, Slack has made significant investments into making their platform a cornerstone developer tool. With the significant shift and emphasis now being placed on remote working teams, choosing the appropriate tools is paramount. One of the largest, if not the largest problems to solve, is how to facilitate asynchronous and synchronous communication. Slack is a well known communication tool, here are some reasons why Slack is the correct choice for your development team.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id="-apps"><br>#apps</h3><p>I’ll state my bias, I am already a huge fan of Slack. My favourite aspect of the platform is the flourishing marketplace. Since the creation of the marketplace, Slack has made it simple for users to adopt integrations created by app builders. You can now find a wealth of 3rd party apps to serve a wide variety of needs within an organization. For a development team, there are a variety of marketplace apps. <br></p><ol><li>Virtual StandUp tools (ex. <em>Geekbot</em>). These give teams the ability to raise blockers and also visibility into the rest of the team without eating away at precious development hours.</li><li>Infrastructure Notifications (ex. <em>PagerDuty, Github, etc.</em>). These apps allow teams to be notified about the import status updates of applications in a shared environment.<br></li></ol><p>💡<em>Tips: Check out <a href="https://cto-ai.slack.com/apps/A0H67RAG0-geekbot">Geekbot</a>, <a href="https://cto-ai.slack.com/apps/A1FKYAUUX-pagerduty">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://cto-ai.slack.com/apps/A8GBNUWU8-github">Github</a>, and <a href="https://cto-ai.slack.com/apps/A676ADMV5-gitlab">Gitlab</a>. Honourable mention to social interaction tools like <a href="https://cto-ai.slack.com/services/B8DMC16UQ">Giphy</a>, which provide much needed levity between Pull Requests.</em><br></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id="-communication">#communication</h3><p>Of course, when we talk about Slack, we can’t not talk about its success as a communication platform. The ability for teams to thread topics at the atomic level and group conversations allows for discussions to happen over an extended period of time—without being derailed or buried by other aspects of the business. This is true for all users of Slack, but is particularly useful for development teams to filter out noise. It also allows developers to keep a holistic view of the business. Vertical &amp; horizontal collaboration makes Slack a powerful tool for the transfer of institutional knowledge. <br></p><p>💡<em>Tips: Monitor your Slack channel activity. If a channel doesn’t have any activity over the course of several weeks, consider merging with another channel. If multiple topics are breaking out at the same time, this is a good indicator the channel is too broad. Also, set a clear topic for each channel.</em><br></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id="-notifications">#notifications</h3><p>This may seem trivial, but the ability to pause notifications has been a feature developers love. It allows individuals to hone into a state of deep work without the thread of “pings” to distract. One of the lesser used features on Slack is the ability to customize notifications, allowing an individual to get notified on specific keywords.<br></p><p>Additionally, being able to set a status provides crucial context to the rest of your team when you might not be able to respond to messages immediately. <em>Slack also just recently released a new set of “remote work specific” statuses. </em> <br></p><p>💡<em>Tips: try using <strong>/dnd [some amount of time] </strong>to go into DO NOT DISTURB mode or <strong>/mute </strong>to a specific channel. Other useful slash commands are <strong>/status </strong>to set or clear your Slack Status and &nbsp;<strong>/remind </strong>which can help you set a reminder to get back to a message at a more appropriate time.</em><br></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id="-snippets">#snippets</h3><p>Slack allows users to format text to help distinguish between conversation and code. Both code snippets and code blocks have proven quite useful for development teams. It makes it much easier to convey information in a text medium, by making it clear what part of the message is logs, which parts are code snippets, and what is clarifying text. &nbsp;<br></p><p>💡<em>Tips: press ⌘ + Shift + Enter (Ctrl + Shift + Enter on Windows/Linux) to open a code snippet pop-up window. Both code text and code block formats have icons below the Slack Chat box.</em><br></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id="-workflows">#workflows</h3><p>Slack empowers users to create simple workflows and build simple alerts and automations. A lot of 3rd party Slack Apps provide notifications on the status of various tools. Workflows allow you to take this one step further by taking action on those notifications. I will add a shameless plug for <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The CTO.ai Ops Platform</a>, which is by far the easiest way I’ve seen to build a Slack App that interfaces with your infrastructure and dev tools. <br></p><p>💡<em>Tips: Check out an example of the CTO.ai EKS Ops workflow </em><a href="https://cto.ai/registry/cto.ai/eks?tab=readme"><em>here</em></a><em>. Slack has put out a lot of documentation on how to build simple workflows that only require interaction with a user (not 3rd party tools) such as Automated Reminders, Approval Processes, and a way to gather feedback. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Slack, of course, has some drawbacks. Slack offers a fairly comprehensive free tier, but, if you’re looking to have more than 10 apps and a full history of conversations, it can start to get pricey for larger teams.</p><p>It also can come across as complex for newbies and if channels are not set up to follow a singular topic a lot of those threaded conversation benefits can disappear. Furthermore, Slack has done such a great job that I actually think it can be a bit of an addictive tool to use.</p><p>However, for my money, it is the best communication tool for development teams currently on the market. When I start a new development team, the first tool I will implement is Slack.</p>

Below, I describe how I use the concept of not thinking instead.</em></p><hr><p>It took me five years to get in the habit of exercising. I just didn't want to do it. I followed Youtube workouts, hopeful that the energetic trainer on the screen would help me get fitter. I swam laps in my pool. I followed my brother on 3K runs. And afterwards, I felt great! On top of the world. And then the next day came, and I remembered I had to do it all over again. I had to be sweaty, push through the pain, and breathe like I had an asthma attack.</p><p>So every morning, I woke up and inevitably started dreading my exercise. It would slink around in my thoughts, casting a dark mood until I got it done. At one point, I would dread exercising enough to stop, and a wave of relief would wash over me. This feeling of calm usually lasted a few months, and then my disappointment in my poor levels of fitness would take over. And the cycle would restart.</p><p><strong>Everyone has things they don't want to do.</strong> It's not limited to exercising. It can be anything from studying everyday for the entire school year to vacuuming the floor. Unless you can avoid that activity with no guilt or regrets, you usually have to do it. You know it will help in the long run, to study to prepare for finals and to have clean floors, but even with that in mind, it can still be incredibly hard to do those activities.</p><p>I realized that the hardest part of doing things I don't want to do is usually not the activity itself, but getting started. Once I get started, I get into a flow and rationalize that since I'm already doing it, I might as well finish.</p><h3>How much motivation do we need?</h3><p>I like to describe the amount of energy I need for a task I don't want to do as an exothermic reaction. In this reaction, the reactants (me) need a minimum activation energy (motivation) for the reaction (task) to occur. After the reaction is complete, the products then settle down into a lower energy state (since no more energy is needed to do the task or worry about it).</p><p><span>

  <img alt="Motivation Energy Reaction" title="Motivation Energy Reaction" src="http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/18e3b/exothermic.jpg" srcset="http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/46946/exothermic.jpg 240w,http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/55489/exothermic.jpg 480w,http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/18e3b/exothermic.jpg 960w,http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/60e21/exothermic.jpg 1440w,http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/69b48/exothermic.jpg 1920w,http://tiffanymatthe.com/static/45c003a7d8906347afa290a5d3bc064d/e1761/exothermic.jpg 3273w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>So how can we get this minimum activation energy? Well, if we don't want to do the activity, it is nearly impossible to gain enough motivation to do it. The good news is that we can avoid the need for such a high activation energy.</p><p>How is this possible? A simple answer: <strong>don't try to find motivation</strong>.</p><p>When you look for motivation, you usually start by reminding yourself about the advantages of getting the task done. But your brain is a stubborn toddler. If you strongly drag it towards one direction, it will fiercely pull you to the other side. The brain thinks there's a choice, and thus a possibility to argue. It will start pointing out all the disadvantages and instant gratification alternatives.</p><p>Since humans instinctively reach for easier things, now you have not only dredged up all the negative points about your task, but also discovered easier alternatives that require an additional amount of energy to resist. In short, you have increased the minimum activation energy required to start the task.</p><p>You will also remember this awful internal debate, and associate these negative feelings with the task itself. Naturally, this does not bode well in the long run.</p><p>On the other hand, if you don't think about the task, you can avoid the entire process of arguing with yourself and making decisions that you will feel guilty about. Instead, just do it. <strong>Become a mindless robot</strong> and don't think twice<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>This is, of course, easy to say and a bit more difficult to do. It's hard to think about not thinking, because you'll inadvertently wonder what it is you were trying to not think about, and bam, you've failed. Not thinking is a process, and just like any other skill you learn, it improves with time and practice. Here are a few tips.</p><h3>Make the decision in advance</h3><p>If you are temporally removed from the thing you don't want to do, it's easier to make a rational decision. By making the decision beforehand, you remove the effort needed to choose before doing your task. This reduces friction and removes one factor that could have led you to think about your task when you start it.</p><p>There are a few ways of making decisions in advance. There's the two-minute rule, where you decide that for anything that takes less than two minutes, you do it. No thinking, no arguing, just swift action. For example, you see a pile of clothes on your bed. It takes less than two minutes to organize then in your drawer, so you do it. Here, you just avoided the trap of thinking about your clothes, feeling unmotivated to put them in order, and giving yourself the terrible alternative of doing it later.</p><p>Another method is planning out your days in advance. This does not always work, but it's a good idea to try it out. The night before, you plan out all of your activities to the minute. And, of course, as you're temporally distanced from these activities, you make rational decisions. Then when the morning comes, you can mindlessly follow the schedule you have made for yourself.</p><h3>Do a small part first</h3><p>Quickly pick a random small part of the activity you were dreading. And commit to only doing that one part. This helps you avoid overthinking by giving your brain a smaller task to easily execute<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p><p>For example, if you need to complete a scholarship application and hate writing about yourself, tell yourself to just write bullet points of topics you might include in the application. Most of the time, after you have invested those first five minutes into the activity, you enter a flow and continue working.</p><p>After implementing these strategies, where I tell myself that I have to exercise every other day for a mere 5 minutes, I now consistently exercise for at least 15 minutes without overthinking it.</p><p>So next time you find yourself not wanting to do something, make yourself a clear rule of when to do it and do the easiest part first. That way, you can avoid making too many decisions and associating the internal turmoil that stems from that process to the activity itself.</p><p>Note, not thinking works wonderfully if your sole purpose is doing an activity you don't want to do. However, unless you don't have any goals to pursue, this is not the best way to go about everything in life. Make sure to take the time to reflect on the overall purpose of the activity and if it brings you closer to where you want to be. If the answer is yes, then feel free to become a mindless robot for any activities that have passed the reflection stage.</p><p>At the small risk of being sued by Nike, just do it.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m fortunate to be involved in a few awesome data-focused communities. Like clockwork, every few months a Data leader will pop up asking for advice on how to calculate the return-on-investment for their team. The question is usually in the context of a budget decision, where they need to justify expanding headcount or purchasing a new tool.</p>

<p>While there’s a subtle irony in the team responsible for quantification struggling to quantify their work, calculating a true “ROI” can be challenging because of the way data teams typically operate.</p>
<p>In some cases, the data team has a top-or-bottom-line impact that can be directly measured. For example, if the company sells data as their product, the Data team has a clearer, more obvious connection to value creation.</p>
<p>But for most teams, their impact is created indirectly: they are partners, acting in support of functions like Marketing, Operations, or Engineering to affect company performance.</p>
<p>In organizations like these, efforts for the Data team to come up with a standalone ROI will be underwhelming and unconvincing. Calculating a crisp “return” on an analysis project or model is difficult, and it’s even harder for infrastructure investments: how do you quantify the impact of a better schema, or a more reliable pipeline? An improvement in data quality can be objectively beneficial, but also quickly taken for granted.</p>
<p>The truth is that if you’re trying to quantify your impact by yourself, you have already lost. <strong>Instead, the best way to tell the ROI story is for other people to tell it.</strong></p>
<p>If your Data team is truly providing value, the leaders of other functions should be lining up to sing your song. Limitations or reductions in Data team headcount should elicit howls from functional stakeholders; the VP Marketing and Head of Ops should be the ones fighting for more Data resources.</p>
<p><strong>If your partners aren’t willing to go to bat for you like this, then it’s time to take a step back to rethink how you’re operating.</strong> Are other teams actually benefiting from your work, or are you detached from business outcomes? Is your team in the trenches with other functions, or only providing input from afar?</p>
<p>There are 3 key areas to examine:</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Too many data teams operate in a centralized, siloed manner. “Ivory Tower” teams may be doing brilliant, insightful work, but they’re too far from the business to make a tangible impact.</p>
<p>I once worked with the “Advanced Analytics Group” at a major CPG company. They all sat together, in one area of one floor of one building, far from the teams they were supposed to be supporting. While they were all intelligent, earnest people, their work was academic at best, and they struggled to justify their existence. This “Center of Excellence” model rarely works, especially as a team grows.</p>
<p>There are other ways to organize a data team. <a href="https://medium.com/@djpardis/models-for-integrating-data-science-teams-within-organizations-7c5afa032ebd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pardis Noorzad has an amazing overview here</a>, and I agree that the "Product Data Science" model is a strong option for most teams. <a href="https://medium.com/@itunpredictable/data-as-a-product-vs-data-as-a-service-d9f7e622dc55" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Justin Gage's "Data as a Service" model</a> also provides a useful lens - is your Data team just providing data, or useful input to decisions? <strong>If not, stakeholder partners are unlikely to stand up and support your team’s ROI story.</strong></p>

<p>Re-organization away from a centralized Data team model can be painful, and may feel like a loss of control or prestige. But it’s critical to keep an open mind — and set ego aside — if you want your stakeholders to feel the impact of your team, and advocate on your behalf.</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Next, integrate your planning process. If your organization uses a system like OKRs, explicitly tie the Data objectives to support the goals of your stakeholders. This makes it clear exactly how your team is impacting functional outcomes.</p>

<p>Infrastructure-level objectives — like implementing a new data warehouse — can live separately, but should still have explicit callouts for how those investments are supporting the higher-level objectives.</p>
<p>Data Leaders should also push for their teams to be involved with other teams’ granular planning cycles. If the Marketing team has a weekly planning meeting or daily stand-ups, the Data analysts supporting that team should be in the room (or Zoom, or whatever).</p>
<p>If your team has its own planning cycles and sprints, involve stakeholders in an explicit prioritization exercise. This will give them more insight into Data activities, and when it comes time to speak to ROI they will already have thought through the upside and tradeoffs around your team’s time.</p>
<p>As a side benefit, by aligning priorities with the business, Data teams <strong>avoid the dreaded “find novel insights” mandate</strong>. If an Analyst is deeply embedded with the Marketing team, partnering on their hardest problems, it’s harder for the CFO to distract them with a one-off wild goose chase.</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>Even if they are well-integrated into the rest of the organization, <strong>the Data team’s work will underwhelm if it’s not actually useful for others</strong>. Today’s tools are a mixed bag here.</p>
<p>BI platforms are great for enabling self-serve and building dashboards. But they also have relatively low ceilings, and aren’t a medium where data scientists can do their most interesting work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Code notebooks are amazing for deeper exploration and model iteration, but are single-player, hard to share, and inaccessible for less-technical folks. Even if a Data Scientist has developed something interesting, there’s no easy way to productize it or make it useful for the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>So Data teams often wind up screenshotting charts, exporting CSVs, and sharing through slide decks, spreadsheets, and Slack. While these tools meet stakeholders where they are, they’re severed from source data and have short half-lives; when a PM wants to update an assumption, they need to ping the analyst, who re-runs, re-exports, and re-sends.</p>
<figure>
    <span>
      <a href="https://hex.tech/static/4f1996f86e4ec2907331c83ad39d3be7/7101e/screenshot_hell.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </span>

  </figure>
<p>This gap in sharing and collaboration not only wastes Data teams’ time, but acts as a drag on their impact. Delivering a forecast model to the Finance team as a live, interactive data app is way more useful than a once-weekly static PDF; the CFO themself will understand the ROI every time they open it to run a new scenario.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see a new crop of tools emerge (disclaimer: <a href="https://hex.tech/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I’m working on one</a>) to help data teams more easily share their work, and create clearer, more tangible impact with the rest of the organization.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s an exciting time in the Data world. Thousands of new people are entering the space as Data Scientists and Analysts. It’s easier than ever to source, transform, and store data. And the ML explosion is unlocking possibilities for insight and inference.</p>
<p>But gaining the budget and support needed to take advantage of all of this is an uphill battle without advocacy from functional stakeholders. By re-evaluating team organization, planning, and tooling, Data teams can ensure their impact is obvious and clear.</p>
<p>Done right, it means the next time a Data leader is asked to justify ROI, they won’t have to. They can sit back, and let others tell the story for them.</p></div></div>]]>

        <article id="post-content">
          <p>Theoretical physics isn’t easy.
Everyone who has seen a documentary about physics or taken a graduate level physics course knows this.
Much of theoretical physics is steeped in complicated math with talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem">symmetries and conservation laws</a>.
Even understanding where basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics_equations">kinematic equations</a> comes from requires a bit of calculus.
But it’s not hard for no good reason.
Physicists want certain things out of their theories and they use abstract ideas to get them.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra">Lie algebras</a>, for example.
These are abstract algebraic objects defined by weird things like Lie brackets and vector spaces over fields.
Most math or physics students won’t formally encounter these things until graduate school because they’re pretty abstract.
But everyone who has taken high school level physics intuitively knows what a Lie algebra is, they just don’t know that they know it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But why do we even need to deal with something so abstract, like Lie algebras?
Why can’t we just work with real numbers and tangible things?
To someone who hasn’t studied any math, talking about things like continuous symmetries and group orbits seems needlessly complicated.
It’s hard to even get to a point where talking about these things seems like a discussion worth having.
But abstract mathematical objects, such as Lie algebras and symmetries, are so ubiquitous in physics for a simple reason: they come directly from our ideas on what good scientific theories look like.</p>

<h2 id="a-naive-universal-theory-of-physics">A naive universal theory of physics</h2>

<p>Let’s describe, in very general terms, what a scientific theory looks like.
At it’s most basic, a scientific theory is a consistent set of ideas that makes accurate predictions about what the world will look like in the future.
For physics, this is a set of rules that give answers to questions that often sound like “where will this ball be in the future if I throw it this fast at this angle?” or “how hot will this wire get if I run a certain amount of electricity through it?”
But questions like these come from hundreds of years of studing physics, so we know a thing or two about which questions to ask.
What if we knew nothing about physics and just wanted to think about what a good physical theory would look like?
Where should we start?</p>

<p>Theories, being about predictability, should predict as broad of a picture as it can while still being accurate.
Saying a certain set of rules work in one context, but a different set of rules work in another seems like some patchwork notion of what a theory should look like.
Even if that worked we’d still need some way of figuring out which rules work in which scenarios.
<strong>At the very least, a “good” universal physical theory, then, would be a theory that is the same everywhere.</strong>
The rules that tell you how things work on Earth should also work in space, and if they don’t we should know why they don’t and be able to explain it.
Rules that tell me how things work where I stand should also tell you how things work where you stand, and we both should agree on each other’s descriptions of how things work, generally.
What’s worth noting is that this isn’t a necessity, prescribed by the universe about how things should operate.
It’s just a desire from people who want to understand the world about what that understanding should look like.</p>

<p>If you’ve heard about Einstein’s theory of relativity, you may be aware that the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulates_of_special_relativity">fundamental postulate of that theory</a> is that the laws of physics take the same form in all intertial frames of reference.
This first postulate states exactly what I’ve described above as a good physical theory<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
There’s no logical dictum stating why this must be true.
But without knowing any physics you can understand why you’d want this notion as a part of your theory of the universe.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-relate-to-symmetries">How does this relate to symmetries?</h2>

<p>An important part about science is thinking about the consequences of your theory.
Since we have this idea about a “good universal physical theory” should look like, what does that mean for how we describe it?
What consequences does this definition of “good” have on our theories, without making further assumptions about it?
Do these consequences give us any clue about where to start looking and what tools we should bring with us?</p>

<p>Let’s start by defining the space we’re working in as .
This can be something like space, or time, or spacetime, but without making specific claims yet, we can say that our goal for studying physics is to try to find a set of physical rules that govern what happens at each point in our physical space, .
We don’t know what these physical rules are, or what they may even look like.
But let’s define the set  as the set of all sets of physical rules.
Formally, then, our goal can be re-stated as finding the element(s) in  that describe the world we live in.</p>

<p>From our desired universal theory, we can say that we’re actually only concerned with a subset of .
That is, we only care about sets of physical rules that include the “physical theories are the same everywhere in ” rule.
Let me stress that up until this point, we haven’t really made any assumptions about how the universe works.
We are just thinking about what studying physics means.</p>

<p>Let’s build on this idea.
Let’s consider some mapping, , where  is the set of physical rules that govern what happens at point .
Then, because of our desire for a “good” theory, if there is some total list of physical rules that we call , we can immediately say something about :</p>



<p>Stated another way,  is invariant under transformations in .</p>

<p>What does this tell us?
It tells us that we should start thinking about invariant transformations and symmetries.
What math do we know about that is concerned with invariant transformations and symmetries?
Groups. Rings. Vector spaces. Lie algebras.
A whole plethora of mathematical tools immediately become available to us simply because we want something in our description of the universe.
This isn’t some statement from on high that we need to obey, it results directly from what we think good scientific theories are.
It tells us that, if nothing else, there is a fundamental conservation law at the heart of our physical theory.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Theoretical physics isn’t easy, but the mathematical tools that physicists use don’t show up for no reason.
What we want our physical theories to look like points us to things we should think about, like symmetries and invariant transformations.
This naturally leads to thinking about Lie algebras, representation theory, vector spaces, and the like.</p>

<p>The reason these tools are so abstract is that we don’t want to predetermine what the universe should look like if we don’t have to.
Using 3-dimensional real vectors presupposes that we live in three spatial dimensions and that our universe is based on real numbers.
If we don’t have to make that assumption, it’s probably safer not to, even if it seems reasonable.
Lots of things that seems reasonable in day-to-day life don’t end up producing reasonable predictions in extreme circumstances, so we have to be careful about each and every assumption we make.
But keeping these assumptions in mind and taking them to their logical consequences can help inform you of what tools you may need and where you will need to look to find something new.</p>

    <section><p><a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> is a software tool designed to help developers
write JavaScript code. Since its creation in 2011, it has been encumbered by a
license which includes the following clause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That stipulation <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#JSON">disqualifies JSHint from the distinction of “free”
software</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil">“open
source” software</a>.</p>

<p>Today, with a release 7 years in the making, we’re removing the clause. Support
for Evil is a new feature but not a breaking change, so in keeping with
<a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, we’ve incremented JSHint’s minor
version. <a href="https://jshint.com/blog/2020-08-02/release-2-12-0/">JSHint version
2.12.0</a> is licensed under
the terms of the MIT Expat license.</p>

<p>In this series of essays, I’ll discuss why this matters for the project, why it
matters to me personally, and how a large group of people came together to make
this possible.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink/">Watching the Ship Sink</a> - how
the license hurt JSHint</li>
<li><a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-dug-in/">Dug In</a> - why I stuck with JSHint and the
relicensing effort</li>
<li><a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-asking-nicely/">Asking Nicely</a> - our inability to
relicense solely via contributor consent</li>
<li>Wrestling it Free - our success in relicensing through rewriting code
(coming tomorrow)</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether or not you care about any of that, the result is the same: JSHint is
now irrevocably free software.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/graphs/contributors"><strong>all the people who’ve contributed to
JSHint</strong></a> for making this
project worth liberating and for enthusiastically participating in that
process. Thanks especially to <a href="https://anton.kovalyov.net/"><strong>Anton
Kovalyov</strong></a>, without whom there would be no JSHint
to relicense. <strong>Ethan Dorta</strong>, <a href="http://alexkritchevsky.com/"><strong>Alex
Kritchevsky</strong></a>, <a href="https://mattsurabian.com/"><strong>Matt
Surabian</strong></a>, and <strong><a href="http://tkellen.com/">Tyler
Kellen</a></strong> masterfully reimplemented code that they
couldn’t see. It’s tough to overstate the difficulty of the challenge and the
shrewdness required to overcome it. <a href="https://tbranyen.com/"><strong>Tim Branyen</strong></a>,
<strong>Isaac Carter</strong>, and <strong>Timon Lukas</strong> also volunteered time and energy toward
this end. <strong>Rick Waldron</strong> and <strong>Caitlin Potter</strong> gladly accepted the burden of
CLA enforcement in addition to their more traditional maintenance duties. The
relicensing effort was dead in the water until <strong>Simon Kaegi</strong> discovered the
free software version of JSLint; thank you, Simon, for catalyzing the campaign.
<strong>Joel Kinney</strong> and <strong>Steven M. Ayr</strong> provided much-needed legal perspective
(to be clear: <em>not</em> legal advice) when this all started, and they did so with
eagerness and passion that would make you think we’d paid them (to be clear: we
didn’t). When things seemed hopeless, <a href="https://pault.ag/"><strong>Paul
Tagliamonte</strong></a>, <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/"><strong>Nadia Eghbal</strong></a>
and <a href="http://punkrocklawyer.com/"><strong>Karen Sandler</strong></a> offered much-needed
encouragement and perspective. In addition to introducing me to Ethan, <a href="https://fsf.org/"><strong>the
Free Software Foundation</strong></a> continues to sponsor writing and
conferences that reinforce the importance of software freedom. By researching
legal concerns regarding software rewriting, <strong>Russell Hoover</strong> and <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/"><strong>Kendra
Albert</strong></a> at <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/teaching/cyberlawclinic"><strong>the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw
Clinic</strong></a> demonstrated
expertise and altruism. <a href="https://joryburson.com/"><strong>Jory Burson</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.lyza.com/"><strong>Lyza
Gardner</strong></a>, and <a href="https://matmarquis.com/"><strong>Mat
Marquis</strong></a> all helped me make sense of this story. The
warmth and dedication of these people can’t be overstated!</p>

<p>Pieter Levels once <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/043-pieter-levels-of-nomad-list">likened start-ups to a swimming pool</a>.</p>

<p>He said there are two groups of people: there are those standing around the pool discussing how to swim, and those who are actually swimming.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don’t know how to swim yet but you’ll learn much faster <em>inside</em> the pool than out of it. I say dive in.</p>

<h2 id="learning-is-a-waste-of-time">Learning is a waste of time</h2>

<p>I think it’s easy to consume too much information from books, videos, podcasts etc. Don’t get me wrong, I love learning this way and think it’s a valuable part of my life, but you can waste time by learning stuff you don’t need yet.</p>

<p>For instance you might read a book about marketing. It contains useful information, sure, but if you’re just starting out then it’s mostly irrelevant. Most of the lessons won’t apply to you until you have 100s of customers.</p>

<p>You’ll also gloss over key bits of information because you simply lack the experience which makes that information valuable.</p>

<p>Instead if you just launched something you’d realise that getting <em>any</em> users can be quite hard. Suddenly marketing isn’t so important and you’re faced with problems that you never knew about. Talking to customers and direct sales is probably more applicable to you at this point.</p>

<p>Without actually <em>doing</em> something you don’t know what you don’t know, and you don’t know what you <em>need</em> to know.</p>

<p>So I say learn as you go. Once you take the plunge you’ll face real problems and future learnings will be much more actionable.</p>

<h2 id="well-its-not-a-complete-waste-of-time">Well it’s not a complete waste of time</h2>

<p>General learning is great in that it exposes you to ideas that will help you later.</p>

<p>Take maths at school for example. Many just do the minimum amount necessary to pass but don’t grasp how it applies to them yet. Thankfully they are exposed to the ideas.</p>

<p>Let’s say they decide to re-pitch their roof one day. Suddenly they’re required to deal with angles and distances, and are reminded of our good friend trigonometry.</p>

<p>So they re-read up on the topic, apply some equations, and successfully re-pitch their roof. Yay for maths! They realise that maths <em>can</em> be useful and start using it more in their lives.</p>

<p>So when I said that you ‘don’t know what you don’t know’, well you also don’t know what will be useful to you.</p>

<p>I think it’s fantastic to be curious and open your mind to new ideas. Things you learn now <em>can</em> help you in the future even if you don’t know it yet.</p>

<p>Just be wary of trying to learn too much if you want to be productive. You might be learning the wrong things.</p>

<h2 id="starting-doesnt-have-to-be-scary">Starting doesn’t have to be scary</h2>

<p>So if you’re one of those people standing at the edge of the pool trying to learn how to swim, perhaps you fear the risk of drowning i.e. you’re scared to fail.</p>

<p>I’m here to tell you it’s not that bad, but I suggest that you fail fast and fail early. Working on an MVP for 6 months vs 2 weeks before a failed launch is probably going to hurt a LOT more.</p>

<p>So save yourself the trouble and get failure out of your system. I’m still learning how to swim too but I’ve enjoyed the experience so far. It turns out the swimmers here are quite friendly.</p>

<p>And like I said before, just by <em>doing</em> something you will be exposed to things you never knew existed. For me this has been things like copy writing, building an audience, and discovering that I enjoy blogging. Who knew? For me it’s been worth it.</p>

<p>So if you’re still at the edge of the pool I say put down your swimming guide, get your feet wet, and take the plunge. The water’s lovely.</p>

The first application in history was from a consumer who applied for a mortgage with one of our 20 eCBSV partners. The consumer consented to sharing their information with SentiLink, our partner, and the Social Security Administration, SentiLink submitted a request to the SSA, and the SSA determined that the information matched. This expedited the approval process for the consumer and the lender and saved them from having to fill out and sign a paper form.</p><p id="6f08">eCBSV (“Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification”) is a new service being offered by the SSA that allows permitted entities to electronically obtain consent from consumers and in real-time verify name/DOB/SSN combinations directly with the SSA. Until this evening, requests for SSA validation required a completed SSA89 form and a wet signature and took hours or even days to process, significantly limiting their use. eCBSV digitizes and dramatically expedites this process. While the stream of eCBSV requests we’re now processing are only the beginning, we believe that within several years there will be tens or hundreds of millions of requests, and eCBSV will be accepted as a major component in KYC and identity verification processes.</p><p id="21fe">The entire team at SentiLink has worked very hard to make eCBSV available for our partners and their customers. This includes getting up before 3:00AM last July in order to submit one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.sentilink.com/sentilink-and-ecbsv-5501d1db6360">first pilot applications</a> to the SSA, implementing all of the OIDC corner cases in the integration, doing <a href="https://research.sentilink.com/sentilink-ecbsv-whitepaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original research on match rates against the SSA’s source-of-truth Numindent file</a>, designing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.sentilink.com/the-ecbsv-product-guide-use-cases-f674b9905123">implementations and potential use-cases</a> with our financial institution partners, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.sentilink.com/the-ecbsv-product-guide-consent-requirements-4fc897e87d44">working closely with the SSA to iron out the consent requirements</a>. I’d like to thank the entire team at SentiLink for sweating and hustling to push this over the line. I’d also like to thank our initial 20 partners; no first time implementation is perfect, and we’re lucky to work with 20 innovative, forward-thinking organizations whose feedback has been and continues to be critical to the success of this program. And lastly all of us would like to thank the SSA, whose hard work and late nights standing up eCBSV has made everything possible.</p><p id="02b5">We don’t believe eCBSV will be perfect or a stand-alone solution, but it is certainly a big step forward and a very useful new tool for financial services companies. We are humbled to help open a new chapter in identity verification in the United States.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><p>Most startups are a hot mess.</p>
<p>Once an organization achieves a basic level of product-market fit, chaos dominates everywhere, and the single hardest problem is to keep the entire company aligned.</p>
<p>Before then, all of the employees fit into a single room, everyone knows what everyone else is working on, and founders can easily walk around desks telling everyone what to build and why.</p>
<p>But at around 50 employees, things change and this approach stops working.</p>
<p>Team and departments get formalized under org charts, all-hands meeting are reduced to the minimum, and all sorts of processes and proxies emerges.</p>
<p>All the new levels of hierarchy creates silos and a feeling of compartmentalization. Meanwhile, a lack of leadership for some functions creates a sense of disorganization and chaos.</p>
<p>The job of a great leader is not to resist this chaos, but to counterbalance it by frequently communicating with extreme clarity principles and priorities, so that everyone, no matter roles, department or seniority, knows the company's goals and direction. Good management is a perpetual anti-entropy device.</p>
<p>Most leaders use all-hands meetings as the de-facto tool in their arsenal to keep the company aligned and informed. During these meetings the entire company gets in a room or on a conference call and receives an update in a lecture-style format.</p>
<p>Meetings, more than any other written communication medium, allows the speaker to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_richness_theory">convey more information</a>, but they can be hard to arrange at scale. This is especially true for remote or distributed organizations where employees work from different locations and time zones.</p>
<p>The most overlooked weapon to keep the company on the same page is a good-old <em>internal weekly newsletter</em>. The obvious example of the category is the <em>Weekly CEO Update Email</em>.</p>
<p>We'll see in this essay not just why every Founder/CEO should send a weekly CEO update email to the entire company, but also what elements are necessary to craft a great Weekly CEO Update.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-internal-newsletter"><a href="#why-an-internal-newsletter" aria-label="why an internal newsletter permalink"></a>Why An Internal Newsletter</h2>
<p>Why isn't an all-hands enough? We're hyperconnected throughout the day, why should a Founder/CEO even bother adding a new piece to the puzzle? Meetings are a great tool because it's a nuanced medium of communication, but they can't replace a regular well-written email. Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Written Communication is Personal</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Written communication is one of the strongest forms of persuasion.</p>
<p>The wire that stretches from the writer to the reader is singular. The writer creates in solitude, and the reader reads in solitude. It's an intimate relationship. Everything happens silently in the brain as an intellectual dialog between the two parts.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>Better Historical References</em></li>
</ol>
<p>References made in spoken words are weak.</p>
<p>On the other side, written communication allows you to pinpoint the exact piece of information that you want to reference to. This not only helps the author to write more extensively but also the reader to fully understand the global scope of the message.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em>Permanent</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Anything that's written in words is permanent and searchable. This means everyone sees the same thing, everyone hears the same thing, and everyone will know the same thing - including future employees who are yet to join your company.</p>
<p>Permanence of communication is the prerequisite to a shared truth.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em>Writing is Costs Effective</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Writing saves time.</p>
<p>If you already have a distributed team, you know how hard and time consuming it is to arrange an all-hands meeting.</p>
<p>Plus, as Basecamp <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate">puts it</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Five people in a room for an hour isn’t a one hour meeting, it’s a five hour meeting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li><em>Inclusiveness For Women and Introverts</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Modern work gives extroverts a free power-up that introverts have to earn through time and practice. Meetings favor individuals who think out loud and are good at discussing things on the fly. They aren't fair to those who need time to think things through. It’s an unfair game for a large number of people. Yet, this rarely gets noticed.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-a-great-weekly-ceo-update"><a href="#how-to-write-a-great-weekly-ceo-update" aria-label="how to write a great weekly ceo update permalink"></a>How To Write a Great Weekly CEO Update</h2>
<p>The outline of a Weekly CEO Update always includes three key elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Summary</li>
<li>Performance Update</li>
<li>Misc: Ops and Culture Highlights</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="summary permalink"></a>Summary</h3>
<p>The summary is an introductory paragraph that summarizes what happened the latest week.</p>
<p>A good summary gets the reader's attention either:</p>
<ol>
<li>By answering a question the <em>reader already has</em> (<em>ie.</em> the company is acquiring a competitor and employees wants to know more about the progress on the deal).</li>
<li>By <em>raising a new question</em> in the reader's mind for which the author is going to provide an answer to (<em>ie</em> reasons why the org chart was restructured and some teams were un-bundled).</li>
</ol>
<p>If the reader already has a clear question, you can go straight to the point by answering it. Otherwise, you should build a compelling summary that naturally leads to it. Failing at both of these means not establishing the relevancy of your message.</p>
<p>Although not a weekly update, one of the best example of summary is the one sent by CEO Stephen Elop to introduce the call to action for Nokia's need to embrace a non-homegrown platform.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://sriramk.com/memos/elop-burning-platforms.pdf">full memo here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulse-website-temp.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/articles/Screenshot%202020-07-08%20at%2023.06.43.png" alt="burning platform internal memo from Nokia CEO Elop" title="burning platform internal memo from Nokia CEO Elop"></p>
<p>The summary is the most important section of the update.</p>
<h3 id="performance-update"><a href="#performance-update" aria-label="performance update permalink"></a>Performance Update</h3>
<p>The performance update is a reminder about how the organization is doing against its most important goals.</p>
<p>Every organization has a few critical top-level goals tied to a set of strategic initiatives. As a leader, you need to solidify this message by repeating it all the time.</p>
<p>So, here's a simplified version of the performance update:</p>
<p><strong>Top-Level Goals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yearly Goals</strong>: current metrics for annual goals and how you’re measuring up against them</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly Goals</strong>: current metrics for quarterly goals and how you’re measuring up against them</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly Priority</strong>: percentage complete and any updates to the most important projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategic Initiatives</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activity #1</strong> [commentary]</li>
<li><strong>Activity #2</strong> [commentary]</li>
<li><strong>Activity #3</strong> [commentary]</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're thinking "Wait, do I really need to state our top level goals in every single update?", the answer is <strong>YES</strong>. The minute you start to get sick of hearing yourself to often, your people are just starting to internalize it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rands/status/1278735543019270145">https://twitter.com/rands/status/1278735543019270145</a></p>
<h3 id="misc-ops-and-culture-highlights"><a href="#misc-ops-and-culture-highlights" aria-label="misc ops and culture highlights permalink"></a>Misc: Ops and Culture Highlights</h3>
<p>The end of your update is the perfect place to share details about people and operations.</p>
<p>Specifically, you want to cover with these three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>: new processes or procedures (eg. a new Slack etiquette, a new remote work policy, new room procedure, or new habits that you are trying to inculcate generally)</li>
<li><strong>Culture Highlight</strong>: share topos, stories or examples from the week that project the company culture</li>

</ul>
<p>Feel free to adapt this section to your own needs and rituals.</p>
<h2 id="the-cadence"><a href="#the-cadence" aria-label="the cadence permalink"></a>The Cadence</h2>
<p>The goal of the Weekly CEO Update is not just to inform, but rather to create an operational cadence for the entire company. Frequent, well-written updates = high-performing, intense pace. Occasional, poorly-written updates = low-performing pace.</p>
<p>A daily update can be too much information. A monthly update can be too little. A weekly update is usually what works best, but depending on the circumstances every cadence would work.</p>
<p>Pick a cadence that not only captures the rhythm of the organization but actually reinforces it.</p>
<h2 id="the-medium"><a href="#the-medium" aria-label="the medium permalink"></a>The Medium</h2>
<p>Don't send an email for the weekly update. Email is a decentralized form of communication. That means that there's no permanent record in a permanent place everyone can see. </p>
<p>Similarily, avoid Slack messages. Chat is great for quick and casual conversations, but it's not the best way to share interne memos and announcements that are more than one-line-at-a-time jousts.</p>
<p>Instead, you should post it in a place where the message can be easily retrieved if you wanted to. Everyone should see, hear and know the same thing – including future employees who are yet to join the company.</p>
<p>I shared <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/introducing-pulse/">here</a> and <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/speed-of-communication/">here</a> how companies like Automattic and Zapier<a href="#"></a> are using tools like <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/speed-of-communication/#3-the-zapier-stack">Async and the Wordpress P2 theme</a> for <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/speed-of-communication/#2-async">asynchronous communication</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-pulse-for-long-form-updates"><a href="#using-pulse-for-long-form-updates" aria-label="using pulse for long form updates permalink"></a>Using Pulse For Long-Form Updates</h2>
<p>Pulse is a stripped-back async work tool that can help you do just that: share long-from updates to keep your team on the same page.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zGKPozx.png" alt="Pulse Editor With Internal Memo"></p>
<p>We’ve specifically designed Pulse from the ground up to support updates across projects, processes, decisions, strategy and more. The type of comms that this product enables can range from global announcements, project proposals, and feedback on processes to welcoming new employees and discussions around long-term endeavors.</p>
<p>But let's go back to the <em>Weekly CEO Update</em> usecase. </p>
<p>The best way to share a Weekly CEO Update in Pulse is to start by creating a dedicated <a href="https://pulseasync.com/features/">Stream</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulse-website-temp.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/articles/Screenshot%202020-07-08%20at%2023.30.49.png" alt="CEO Weekly Update Stream in Pulse"></p>
<p>People in your organization can follow the Stream and read your Weekly Updates directly from the Pulse Website or (once you installed the <a href="https://pulseasync.com/browser-extension">Browser Extension</a>) anytime they open their browser's new tab.</p>
<p>Let's look at some real examples.</p>
<p>Jason Lemkin used to run an internal publication called <code>The Daily Jason</code> where he sent every morning an email to the entire SaaStr team. The Daily Jason's Update always included the top 3 priorities for the week and how the team was measuring up against them.</p>
<p>You can learn in this quick video Jason talking about it: </p>
<p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOR9-NSwNAo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>
<p>In Pulse he would have created a <code>@daily-jason</code> stream and shared there every morning an update. The team would have been notified either by Slack, Email or the Browser Extension.</p>
<p>What's benefit of using Pulse over Email, Slack or other decentralised communication channels?</p>
<ol>
<li>Updates are permanently recorded in a fixed place not just your current team members, but also for the future ones who are yet to join the organization. This approach makes it super easy for a new employees to immerse in the company tone and culture, and understand how your company operates. A much better experience than digging in organized Slack channels.</li>
<li>You, as a leader, can reference updates previously published by your team, in the next weekly update. For instance, Jason …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>The world of simulated realism is back: Say Hi to Neumorphism! You either love or hate the hottest 2020 design trend, but one thing is for sure: You need to try it!</p>

<p>At first glance, neumorph interfaces shine through monochrome, smooth and haptic surfaces with huge, cloudy shadows. Like skeumorphism, this design polarizes. You might feel reminded of the temptation of activating all the Photoshop layer effects at once. If you want to be better than that, you’ve come to the right place.</p>

<p>This list collects all the ressources, tutorials, templates, code snippets and design files that you need to get started with neumorph UI design.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    
    <p>Small tasks are often mundane, insignificant, and dull. We spend the biggest part of our time doing them and wish we could have more time to spend on some big and important things.</p>
<p>But what we frequently fail to realize is how vital such small things are, their potential to influence our lives, and that the big and important things are like jigsaw puzzles made of many tiny pieces. To build the whole picture that you can later look at and feel great about, you have to organize and combine many small parts that, when put together, create something visually stunning. Moreover, sometimes minor events serve as triggers to the most impactful effects that happen to us.</p>
<p>The only difference from a jigsaw puzzle is that life’s events are not interlocking pieces, and rarely do you precisely know the outcome. In some cases, you can create some expectations on the result, but it is entirely unknown for the others.</p>
<h2 id="a-snowflake-can-cause-an-avalanche">A Snowflake Can Cause An Avalanche</h2>
<p>The most massive, overarching, and impactful events are sometimes triggered by something infinitesimally small. Just look at this comic by Abstruse Goose:</p>
<figure>

<p>Although it might be a bit exaggerated and despite the fact that there is no evidence an apple actually hit Newton on the head,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> it demonstrates that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The small changes can have a chain reaction, leading to bigger things with a more significant impact.</li>
<li>You never know how the universe has arranged things until you get there. Billions of apples had fallen from trees since the dawn of civilization, but it was one apple that did so at the right time in the right place when Newton was around, looking in a contemplative mood that the notion of gravitation came to his mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might also have heard about the <strong>Butterfly Effect,</strong> which, in chaos theory, has a more scientific name of <em>“sensitive dependence on initial conditions."</em> It states that small changes in the initial conditions can create significantly different outcomes in some systems. The “Butterfly Effect” term is derived from the metaphorical example that a tornado is caused by flaps of the wings of a butterfly on the other side of the globe.</p>
<p>Another notable example is Kyle MacDonald, who bartered his way from a single red paper clip to a house in a series of fourteen online trades over a year.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the COVID-19, a global pandemic that has affected almost all countries and over 17 million people, most probably has started from a single person (the so-called patient zero).</p>
<h2 id="life-is-a-series-of-choices-you-make-every-day">Life Is A Series Of Choices You Make Every Day</h2>
<p>It is not only the immense potential to trigger chain reactions that lead to stories with an enormous impact that characterizes small events.</p>
<p>Another property of little things is that they have a compounding effect. The more things you do, the larger the compounding impact gets. Eventually, it becomes visible.</p>
<h3 id="the-visibility-threshold">The Visibility Threshold</h3>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/the-imperceptible-nature-of-everyday-change/">the imperceptible nature of everyday change</a>, we very rarely perceive how we have changed during a single day.</p>
<ul>
<li>You go to the gym once—you don’t see any effect after you have exercised.</li>
<li>You eat a salad—you don’t see any impact on your weight.</li>
<li>You study for your exam for an hour—you might feel you haven’t progressed at all in that regard.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the reality is that all of those things count. Every little thing counts and every little thing is important. The small events and efforts in our life are the backbone of the bigger things: our lifestyle, career, health, happiness.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/visibility-threshold.png" alt="The Small Things Impact Visibility Threshold"></p>
<p>It is when you continue to go to the gym, eat healthily, study more, that you start seeing the effects. That’s because the cumulative impact got big enough for us to spot it. Take a moment to look back at your greatest achievements in life, and think about how long you have been working to achieve those—how many small and dull things you have completed to realize your grand objective. And consider whether you would accomplish your goals without doing all those tiny things.</p>
<h2 id="your-impact-on-the-world-is-significant">Your Impact On The World Is Significant</h2>
<p>Having said all that, it is clear why some people excuse themselves from making good things <em>“because it won’t make a difference."</em> It is because the impact of their actions is so small it doesn’t reach the visibility threshold, so it seems worthless. But it doesn’t mean there is no impact at all. Like a drop of water in an empty cup—it is no big deal, but pour 1000 more such droplets, and you can quench someone’s thirst.</p>
<p>Each action we do has a tremendous potential to change our lives, the lives of people around us and the world we live in. And whenever you think you are too insignificant to make an impact on the world, remember that sometimes it takes only a single molecule to change the course of history.</p>

<p>In 1726, Newton shared the apple anecdote with William Stukeley, who included it in a biography, “Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Life,” published in 1752. According to Stukeley, “After dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden, &amp; drank tea under the shade of some apple trees… he told me he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind… occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood.” <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

August 3, 2020 | https://ospfranco.github.io/post/2020/08/03/what-react-native-is-missing-to-become-the-default-framework-to-build-apps-on-all-platforms/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ospfranco.github.io/post/2020/08/03/what-react-native-is-missing-to-become-the-default-framework-to-build-apps-on-all-platforms/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I was trying to develop app that runs on ALL platforms (iOS, android, windows, mac), I was encouraged by the announcement that react-native recently added support to macOS thanks to the guys at microsoft (facebook has now jumped on the bandwagon), so after a couple of months of development I have to call quits, there is just too much friction, I’m a one man team developing this on my freetime and I have rarely encountered so much problems developing a simple app.</p>

<p>React native promises this utopia, we’re you write once and gets executed everywhere, which is true when everything works, however when it doesn’t the pain starts, with the current jump into desktop environments there is a lot more friction than the more mature mobile counterparts.</p>



<p>I had assumed that despite it’s young age microsoft wouldn’t announce a “release” if the product was not ready, and I was willing to go the extra mile cutting slack here and there, ignoring the rough edges, I even patched some libraries myself, with my barely passable knowledge about the macOS toolchain, swift, obj-c and cocoapods, but I reached the point of break when trying to draw vector graphics.</p>

<p>Currently if you want to draw vector graphics on react-native the default choice is react-native-svg, surprise surprise it’s not supported on macos (or windows), support might come someday, but you are at the mercy of the react-native community until someone takes the time to port it to each platform, and let me tell you the react-native community does not have a great track record of producing well maintained software.</p>

<p>And this is a story that keeps repeating itself for me (and not only on macOS) I’ve been working with RN for some years now and everytime I reach the point where libraries are abandoned left and right, new functionality or patching requires deep knowledge of the platform and build systems.</p>

<p>Another current paint point React-navigation? you are stuck with version 2.X, which has no native dependencies and has been deprecated for years already, other libraries like camera, location, etc… you can forget them for a few months/years, it’s incredibly bold of microsoft to claim their “store” app is built with react-native, it’s basically a bunch of webviews cobled together, and it is basically a app that consists of some lists, if that is all your app will need, then you can safely use react-native on desktop.</p>



<p>Current windows and macos ports are being developed with the idea that all supported platforms should have 1 to 1 feature parity, this also includes behavior parity.</p>

<p>On the surface this sounds reasonable, <strong>it’s not</strong>, because mobile and desktop do not behave the same, the way you interact with an app using keyboard and mouse is not the same as with mobile, on desktop keyboard shortcut support is a must, being able to detect key combinations is a must, RN does not support any of this, even some of the default behavior with a digital keyboard does not translate well to physical machine, another thing is app lifecycle (focus/blur) are bound to different rules as on mobile</p>

<p>At best you will end up with an app that feels weird to use on desktop (UI not withstanding, just talking about UX here), so far my workaround has been to attach listeners on the native sides and transmit events to the rn side… you can imagine this is time consuming to get right, and sometimes you will just not get it right no matter what</p>

<h2 id="its-open-source">It’s open source!</h2>

<p>You want to patch this yourself? here are some of the problems in the order that I found them as I went along:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I barely learned Swift, I cannot justify learning obj-c, guess what rn is written in obj-c</li>
  <li>You have to learn the macOS specific APIs, most of the content in the internet is written for the iOS APIs</li>
  <li>Apple’s documentation is one of the worst I have seen so far</li>
  <li>You have to start digging into the more hardcore parts of the APIs, CoreGraphics?</li>
  <li>If somehow you manage to do all of that, repeat it for other platforms Android, Windows?</li>
  <li>Once you have your piece of native code you have to use the RN bridge, did you know it is also slow? now you have to do TurboModules, which is c++… also no (usable) documentation</li>
  <li>Oh yeah, add one more platform, react-native-web</li>
  <li>Don’t forget about each platform build system, I still don’t fully grasp everything Gradle does to build an Android app</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to be completely fair, some of these problems are not unique to react-native, the problem is… there is already a solution out there to run code on every architecture/machine that does not require you to learn a new API every 2 days or so, it’s called a web browser</p>



<p>As for react-native, besides the corporations with big pockets taking over the job the community is currently trying to fill, I see no good solution, the disparity of libraries, APIs, platforms makes this a really challenging problem to tackle in the typical OSS manner, and in the end, we are all re-creating chrome with a lesser memory footprint and some performance gains (which I still would debate)</p>

<p>As for my and my project I think the best path forward is web, I can still use react and the web APIs are good enough for what I need to do, electron gets a lot of flak for the size of installation and memory consumption, but chrome is an OS by itself, so much of this small details have been abstracted away and solved by a well paid cohesive team and with webassembly the possibilities are greater than ever, not saying it is perfect, but it sure beats holding your breath for the OSS community and a menage of companies/team (all with different incentives) to catch up</p>

<p>Creating shallow native apps that heavily use embedded webviews seems a good compromise when truly native functionality is needed, I remember I saw a couple of videos of the guys at basecamp, they have tiny native teams that only write small container apps but the bulk of the work is in the web and that can be reused inside the shallow containers, that seems to be the most reasonable thing (even if you have to learn the basic of each OS to create a container app, which you end up doing anyways with RN)</p>

<p>While avoiding code that resulted in such comments was harder to enforce in the
pre-framework era, opinionated frameworks such as
<a href="https://emberjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ember.js</a> offer us concrete ways to ship code with
confidence. This is known as the ember happy path, code smells can be identified
when an implementation strays away from the path.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, such problems can be caught early enough in the planning
cycle by collaborating closely among all stakeholders, making sure that design,
development and product work together towards finding functional solutions that
are worthy of our users' trust.</p>
<p>Delivering products with sustainable foundations is a core value that we hold
dear at simplabs. Such foundations, while relatively easy to set up on a
greenfield project are an entirely different story in any long-lived project
that might not have started with a solid foundation.</p>
<p><strong>"So how do I tackle refactoring legacy code that has made its way into
multiple core systems?"</strong></p>
<h3 id="stop-development-fix-it-now">Stop development, fix it now!</h3>
<p>While all too tempting this approach has quite a heavy list of pre-requisites in
order to be successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks have already been scoped out and achievable goals are set</li>
<li>The refactoring effort does not block mission-critical features</li>
<li>No deadlines at the door</li>
<li>The total cost and lead time impact must be justifiable to stakeholders</li>
<li>A robust and comprehensive test suite</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, teams with deadlines will have maintenance periods where engineers are
allocated time to "fix" the codebase. Time and time again I have seen this
pattern repeated with similar outcomes, overrun budgets and half-finished
long-lived branches.</p>
<p>As we tally up the costs (dev/design/product/... time, loss of competitiveness,
etc...), it is important to keep in mind that this is a one-time investment we
pay for a more standardized codebase with a reduced chance of future feature
work delay.</p>
<h3 id="stop-quick-fix-time">Stop! Quick-fix time!</h3>
<p>A scenario we are all too familiar with, everything is going according to plan,
development is running smoothly, marketing is preparing their release post. Then
the (un)expected happens, a part that seemed unrelated starts breaking.</p>
<p>A common approach, that has long term implications, is to run a quick analysis,
attempt to pinpoint the issue and patch it in time to meet the deadline. While
this may address our short-term needs, if not followed up with a code audit and
analysis, it will come back to haunt us.</p>
<p>Just recently I experience a situation where a quick fix implemented six months
ago set us back a total of two weeks. Further investigation revealed that the
code causing this was committed, by someone that was no longer on the team, a
little over <strong>three years</strong> ago.</p>
<p>Any long-lived codebase that does not have regular code audits, will at one
point or another have parts that are not understood by the current team.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous method; the cost for this approach depends, among other
things, on the time the quick-fix spends as tech debt and the future features it
impacts.</p>
<p><strong>"An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is not only small and
easy to do but is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system
of compound growth. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you
don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change" - Atomic
Habits by James Clear</strong></p>
<h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
<p>Once the issue is resolved, the system in place must be revisited and improved
to reduce the probability of running into similar problems in the future.</p>
<p>Sustainable development habits must be put in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training and leveling-up existing staff resulting in higher code quality</li>
<li>Reducing the

by pairing and knowledge sharing through collaboration</li>
<li>Code audits when a team member leaves, walkthroughs when a new one joins</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jul 30, 2020</p><img src="https://www.wesleyabbey.io/images/hal.jpg" alt="Hal 9000"><h2>OpenAI, GPT-3, and Skynet</h2><p>Recently OpenAI released an API beta to interface with their products. They use the GPT-3 language model and from the demos it looks incredibly powerful.</p><p>GPT-3 has demonstrated it can write poetry, generate stories, code, build excel docs, and many other impressive tasks that’ll make you wonder if the robot apocalypse is around the corner. 🤖</p><p>These impressive results from GPT-3 are again bringing up conversations around general AI and the likelihood of us "summoning the demon". This is a problem we should be preparing for, but the likelihood of creating a general AI in the same intellectual league as a human is still incredibly far away. Nonetheless, people keep bringing up the dangers of AI, and along with that, how we can protect ourselves.</p><p>Asimov’s three laws of robotics are always brought up in these conversations as an answer to save us all from a "Skynet situation". These laws—while great for a science fiction novel—are nonsense. The one takeaway you should have from this: Don't take these laws seriously.</p><h2>Asimov’s three laws of robotics</h2><p>Let's break down these ridiculous rules.</p><p>The laws originally seen in <em>Runaround</em> and <em>I, Robot</em>:</p><p>– <strong>First Law</strong>. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p><p>– <strong>Second Law</strong>. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p><p>– <strong>Third Law</strong>. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</p><p>Asimov eventually realized there were some obvious holes with these three alone, so he eventually added another law to precede the others</p><p>– <strong>Zeroth Law</strong>. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.</p><p>It should be noted these laws <em>don't even work in the books.</em> Yikes. 🤦</p><h2>Loopholes: Why these laws don't work</h2><p><strong>How do we define "human"?</strong> Intuitively this is a straightforward question to answer. I'm human. You're human. Your family is all human. Your puppy isn't human, despite loving her more than other humans.</p><p>However, computers are dumb and in order to understand what a human is we need to strictly define the term. This step opens the door to a lot of weird quirks of philosophy that we otherwise rarely think about. It forces us to comprehensively solve ethics. Some examples:</p><p>Is an unborn fetus a human?
This has been a major issue for years and in order to define humans you have to clearly take a stance on this. If you can solve this one you’ll win a nobel prize.</p><p>What about someone who has died?
Most people might be inclined to say no, but then you’d end up an AI that would never attempt CPR. How long does someone have to be dead in order to count? Maybe you don’t have a time limit, but then you could end up with robots wandering earth trying to revive the dead. That doesn’t even sound like a terrible idea, until you realize it’s a recipe for zombies. 🧟</p><p><strong>You can’t program Asimov’s rules without taking a firm ethical stance on practically every issue</strong></p><h2>Should you fear the demon?</h2><p>Asimov’s laws can’t save us, but is a general AI even close to reality? Elon Musk compares creating a general AI to "summoning the demon". A little too alarmist for my taste, but I don’t think he’s wrong. The creation of an intelligent AI would be an existential threat to the human race.</p><p>The key to avoiding this is to ensure an AI’s goals are aligned with ours. If this alignment is done successfully it would bring about the greatest age of human prosperity in history. Any sort of misalignment of goals could result in our new robot-zombie world. This is not as good a situation as it is a great plotline for a new Terminator movie.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I love Asimov’s books, especially the <em>Foundation</em> series. But his laws are nonsense, filled with loopholes, and won’t help with a robot uprising.</p><p>I don’t have fears of AI becoming an issue anytime soon, but it’s something everyone should be thinking about to make sure we’re prepared. Until then Asimov’s laws should only be talked about in your book club discussions.</p><hr><div><p><img src="https://www.wesleyabbey.io/images/profile.jpg" alt="A handsome man."></p><p>I'm Wesley.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently went through the <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> program and <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">loved it</a>.</p>
<p>But the one sour note was that we only got $1,000 AWS credits when <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">the copy seemed to promise $5,000</a>. Our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-chose-a-marketing-and-app-monorepo">entire application infrastructure is on AWS</a> so those credits are pretty much straight-up cash to us. We don't have much of a digital footprint either, so $5,000 goes a long way.</p>
<p>That's why this weekend was such a surprise.</p>
<h3 id="the-email">The Email</h3>
<p>Here's how the timeline went.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">we posted an article</a> politely noticing that we hadn't been able to secure the full $5,000 and kinda wondering out loud why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://formcake.com/blog/the-founders-guide-to-stripe-atlas">Stripe contacted us</a> and explained that the credit amount was more of a lifetime cap and that it was ultimately up to AWS what we got.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We send <em>one more</em> email just 'cause, even though it seems clear AWS only offers $1,000 for bootstrapped startups. The email is simple and amounts to: "Is there any way we could get the full five thousand in credits?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stripe responds to this chain of events with yet another email, this one even kinder and more politely worded.</p>
<section>
Hey David,

<p>Thank you for sharing the details here. It sounds like we should be able to get this sorted out so that you receive the $5K in AWS credits for Stripe Atlas users.  </p>
<p>I believe it may be the case that you applied for AWS credits with a different link than the one shared for Stripe Atlas users to activate. We do not typically see users needing to answer the question regarding funding sources. I did check in with AWS on this and it sounds like they're currently processing your most recent application that you submitted through the Stripe Atlas link. They've let me know that they will email you directly with next steps, which may take up to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will all soon be sorted! If you do have any questions on this or anything else, please feel free to reach out! I'll check back in a couple weeks on the AWS front, or feel free to share any updates as well!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Taylor</p>
</section> 

<p>It looks like the funded/bootstrapped question indicated the process had gotten miffed somewhere and <em>Stripe reached out to AWS on our behalf</em> to make sure things got cleared up.</p>
<p>This weekend we saw $5,000 in credits enter our AWS account. Keep in mind that's actually <strong>in addition</strong> to the $1,000 we've already received, bringing out total up to $6,000 in AWS credits through the Stripe Atlas program.</p>
<p>For us this is a big injection. It basically funds our full application operations and lets us play around with putting money elsewhere - or just continuing to build features and mature without any kind of pressure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A couple of takeaways from the entire affair.</p>
<h4 id="1-send-that-one-last-email">1. Send that one last email</h4>
<p>Even if it seems like a bit much, or things are settled, just be sure you ask and give the other person a chance to help you in ways you can't predict. A hail mary "Is there anything I'm missing?" can sometimes land.</p>
<h4 id="2-stripe-is-truly-wonderful">2. Stripe is truly wonderful</h4>
<p>Stripe monitored the developer community enough to see our initial posts, proactively reached out to us, and then worked with AWS to ultimately get us a greater-than-even-promised payout. When people say Stripe is a company for developers, they often mean its great API or clear documentation, but this is I think one of the greatest testaments to their dev-first culture.</p>

August 3, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/mindsets-and-expectations/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/mindsets-and-expectations/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We often hear that Rust is a language that is too complex and too difficult to learn. While, yes, the language <em>is</em> complex, we have identified some existing mindsets and expectations that serve as obstacles to the learning process. Let's discuss these obstacles and how we can alleviate them in our first post on <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/learning-and-teaching-rust/">learning Rust</a>.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-rust-to-other-languages">Comparing Rust to other languages</h2>

<p>When you learn your first programming language, it's very likely that you'll hear this observation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you know one programming language, you know them all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement makes an interesting point, but it is a faulty assumption. It is also more applicable for some sets of languages than it is for others. For instance, it does not take into account which language(s) you know and which one(s) you are learning.</p>

<p>While most languages share a common set of concepts (e.g., variables, conditionals, iteration, data typing, and functions), they may diverge widely beyond the realm of this common ground. Some languages are more divergent than others.</p>

<p>Not only do we have the faulty assumption that knowing one language allows you to "know them all", we also live with the widespread phenomenon of engineers' devotion to a single language. Oftentimes, these engineers consider their favorite languages to be universally superior to others.</p>

<p>With the coupling of these two problems, we see the following patterns emerge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The people who struggle the most are the ones who are already experts in other languages (even the languages that feel similar to Rust, like C, C++, or Go).</li>
  <li>People often attempt to implement things in Rust in a way that is idiomatic in a different language, even if that other language has significantly different scope and behavior (e.g., Python or JavaScript).</li>
  <li>People often attempt to implement a relatively complex challenge <em>before</em> they have grasped core Rust concepts (e.g., attempting to use or modify existing libraries, or attempting to re-write a script or large-scale program).</li>
</ul>

<p>While these learning strategies and approaches are not invalid, they only take you so far. And without immediate successes, it can be very difficult to motivate yourself to continue. In short, <a href="http://nischalshrestha.me/docs/cross_language_interference.pdf">your attachment to another language can serve to <em>interfere</em> with learning Rust</a>.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the concepts that are unique to Rust are what cause the most pain during the learning process (e.g., <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">Ownership and Borrowing</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html">Lifetimes</a>).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-learn-rust---effectively">How to learn Rust - effectively</h2>

<p>In tandem with the patterns we have mentioned above: <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular">people in the industry are fascinated with Rust</a> and what Rust aims to accomplish, but they hesitate to learn it when they hear rumors about how difficult it is. Thus, they don’t try.</p>

<p>Conversely, we've observed some promising patterns with the folks we've spoken to - folks who have had success learning Rust (either from us, or from the internet at large).</p>

<p>Here's what they tend to have in common:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They began their learning process by spending time with Rust's core concepts.</li>
  <li>They had a mentor or trainer who could help them conceptualize important parts of the language.</li>
  <li>They started small, building on successful projects and slowly increasing their scope.</li>
  <li>They were new to programming, or they came from a significantly different domain; thus, they didn't have expectations for how Rust would compare to other languages.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3 id="three-things">Three things</h3>

<p>Learning Rust can and should be an enjoyable and effective experience! Based on the patterns we've observed, we suggest that you keep these three things in mind.</p>

<h4 id="learn-how-to-walk-before-you-try-to-run">Learn how to walk before you try to run.</h4>

<p>As we've mentioned, an experienced programmer may attempt to implement a relatively complex challenge before addressing core Rust concepts. This is not surprising: it's reasonable for you to expect to hit the ground running, especially if you work as a software developer or you write programs for fun.</p>

<p>By the same token, it's likely that you're able to dedicate only a limited amount of time to learning Rust. Are you learning Rust in your free time, or evaluating it for work? For whatever reason, you might try and learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>As such, we know that you might find it very frustrating to slow down and take tiny steps - instead of running a fast sprint or marathon. Nonetheless: take heart! Once you have developed an understanding of core concepts and fundamentals, you will take bigger steps and move on to complex projects with more ease and grace.</p>

<h4 id="appreciate-the-divergence">Appreciate the divergence.</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing completeness</a> is a "thing", but some programming languages are more suitable for certain tasks than others. Appreciate these different languages as the tools they are, with the specific features they offer and the things they do particularly effectively. Perhaps your task is to open a can of soup: you could certainly use a chainsaw to do this, but wouldn't you prefer a different tool?</p>

<p>The process of identifying the similarities between languages: this is only the <em>beginning</em> of a programmer's journey outside of their comfort zone. It is only the <em>beginning</em> of their discovery of the kind of tool they hold in their hands, and the kinds of problems that it is meant to solve.</p>

<p>The <em>goal</em> of the journey is to recognize and master the differences between tools. There would be no point in learning other languages, if they <em>really</em> were all the same!</p>

<h4 id="practice-patience">Practice patience.</h4>

<p>In the big picture, Rust is a very young language and has undergone a lot of changes in the last several years. Indeed, many of its features have grown less complicated since the early days of its existence. Rumors have persisted in regards to how hard it is to learn Rust, but it's very likely that <strong>these rumors are outdated and refer to a version of the language that no longer exists</strong>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, we have reiterated the fact that <em>time</em> is inherent to the process of learning Rust. We refer to the fact that Rust is under <em>active development</em>, yes, but more importantly: we refer to the <em>patience</em> that we have noticed in folks who have succeeded in their journey. Give some time to your learning process, and you'll see that core concepts like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">Ownership and Borrowing</a> deliver joy: they make it easy and comfortable to write programs that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety">memory-safe</a>!</p>

<h2 id="stay-tuned-">Stay tuned …</h2>

<p>In the next part of this series, we will discuss one of Rust's unique philosophies: its aim to be <em>practical</em>. This is helpful not only in production, but also in the process of learning the language.</p>

<p>We hope you will read onwards! In the meantime, please consider signing up for our <a href="http://eepurl.com/gYWZKr">newsletter</a> or enlisting us as <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training">trainers</a> for your team.</p>

            <p>Back in April, I participated in the UChicago Midwest Trading Competition with a couple of friends, and we ended up winning 2 out of 3 cases and the overall competition. So I’ve procrastinated on writing this blog post for 3 months, but I needed to get this out before I start working at a trading firm in a few weeks. This is the first part in (hopefully) a series of my favorite trading cases.</p>
<p>First, let me take you through how we tackled one of my favorite cases, building a futures market making bot on the Chicago Electricity Futures Market.</p>
<h2 id="the-case">The Case</h2>
<p>You are a market maker on the Chicago Electricity Futures Market. Real electricity trades daily between consumers and producers on the Chicago Electricity Spot Market, but the futures market is where traders bet on the price of electricity in the future. For instance, an electricity producer could sell 10 MWh of December futures to lock in the price of their electricity in December, thus hedging against the price of electricity. There are 4 futures contracts which expire on the last day of June, August, October and December. These future contracts are cash-settled, so they settle to the current spot price of electricity upon expiry.</p>
<p>Here’s how the electricity spot market works. Chicago produces electricity in 3 ways: Natural Gas generators ($2/MWh), coal generators ($3/MWh), and peaker plants. Electricity is consumed in that order, first natural gas, then coal and finally the peaker plants. Each year, the city starts out with fresh capacity of natural gas (around 1300MWh) and coal (around 450MWh), and moves onto the next source once the previous is exhausted. Peaker plants are special - they start at $3.001/MWh and do not run out, but each extra MWh produced costs $.001 more than the previous. This is what the price/consumption graph looks like.</p>
<p><img src="https://tianyi.io/price_consumption.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each day, consumers purchase a random amount of electricity. Each day, you also know how much they used the previous day before you start trading. Note that you cannot buy or sell electricity on the spot market itself, you can only observe it.</p>
<p>As a market maker (MM), your job is to facilitate trading of futures contracts by reducing the spread in the market, which lower costs of transactions for traders. Take a market with bids for $1.50 and offers at $2.00. A ‘fair’ price of the contract would be $1.75, the mid price. However, the $.50 spread between the bid and offer makes it impossible to trade at the fair price. You (a MM) could come in and bid for $1.60 and offer at $1.90, decreasing the spread from $.50 to $.30. Someone who buys a stock pays $1.90 for it instead of $2.00, saving $.10, while you make the difference between $1.90 and the ‘fair’ mid price of $1.75. If someone else then sells a contract to you at $1.60, you have made a clean profit of $.30 without a resulting position in the contract, and everyone’s happy. But it’s not that simple: If the contract price rises to $2.00 after your sale, then you have made a loss of $.10. Also, another market maker could come into the market to bid for $1.70 and offer at $1.80, taking away your profits.</p>
<p>To make money market making, you have to be smart - know the value of the contract by predicting the price of electricity in the future. You also need to be aggressive - provide your best price to the market to make more profitable trades. Therefore, a successful bot requires 3 components: a good guess for the ‘fair’ price of the contract, a bot which trades aggressively but minimizes risk taking, and a way to augment the dumb bot with human intuition. I will discuss each of these parts below.</p>
<h2 id="whats-our-fair">What’s our fair?</h2>
<p>We first try to compute our ‘fair’, a prediction of the price of the 4 future contracts. Let’s do this in a Jupyter Notebook!</p>

<h2 id="execution-matters">Execution matters</h2>
<p>During the competition, all teams have a position limit of 1000 lots in each contract. This means that you are not allowed to be long or short more than 1000 lots of each contract. In the real world, market makers are similarly limited by the amount of risk they can take with their capital. Teams are effectively limited in the amount of trades they can make, so no one can dominate all of the trades in the market.
<img src="https://tianyi.io/case1pnl.png" alt="">
This is the profit and loss (pnl) chart of one of the rounds. How did we (rice-berkeley-mit) manage to make more profit than the next 2 teams combined? Ultimately, I think most of our edge came from how we traded more aggressively and managed our position limits more intelligently, such that our trading volume was multiples of what other teams did.</p>
<p>In this section, I want to break down our market making strategy by building up pieces of our strategy from a naive market making bot. We’ll discuss various test cases of market situations which a naive bot fails on, and strategies our bot used to profit from.</p>
<h4 id="the-naive-market-making-bot">The naive market making bot</h4>
<p>A naive MM bot takes in a <code>fair</code> as input, and asks for an <code>edge</code> around this fair. A <code>size</code> variable For instance, <code>fair</code> = $3.50, <code>edge</code> = $.10, <code>size</code> = 100. At each time interval, the bot places a bid into the market for 100 lots for $3.40, and places an ask for 100 lots at $3.60. Essentially, the MM is asking for an edge, or expected profit, of $.10 for each trade that it makes.</p>
<h4 id="case-1-the-informed-customer">Case 1: The informed customer</h4>
<p>A trader enters the market with information that the fair price is $3.70. (We still think fair = $3.50.) For ten successive days, the traderbuys 100 lots from us at $3.60. After the contract expires at $3.70, we have made a loss of $.10 * 1000 = $100. Could we have done better? Should we have sold the last 100 lots to the trader at $3.60, despite being short 900 lots already?</p>
<p>We could be more averse to taking on large, unbalanced positions, and this can be represented by the <code>fade</code> parameter. Let <code>fade</code> = $.02. That means for every 100 lots of position we take, we will augment our fair price by $.02. After selling 500 lots (thus short 500), our new fair is $3.50 + $.10 = $3.60. Our new market is $3.50 at $3.70. The trader will stop buying from us because he will not make a profit anymore. With fading, we ended up selling 500 stocks at an average price of $3.65, making a loss of $25, a big improvement.</p>
<h4 id="case-2-competing-with-other-market-makers">Case 2: Competing with other market makers</h4>
<p>It’s nice to be able to make a $.10 edge on each trade, but with 15 other market makers in the market, you won’t get to make any trades. So let’s reduce our edge to $.05. What happens in situations where there are no other market makers quoting in the market? Should you be satisfied with only $.05 in edge?</p>
<p>This is where we have to start considering the action of other market participants. We look at the book, a collection of all bids and asks on the market (and their respective sizes) to know what other traders are doing. We introduce the <code>slack</code> parameter, which represents flexibility in our edge. Say <code>slack</code> = $.10. Then, we vary our edge from $.05 to $.15 depending on market conditions. If there are no other MMs on the market, we would present our bids and asks with an edge of $.15, so $3.35 at $3.65 in the above example. If there is a competing bid of $3.40, then we will ‘penny’ that bid by changing our bid to $3.41. By improving our price by a penny, we ensured that any customer trade will be executed with us first. This pennying mechanism ensures that we make the most trades possible, while making the most from each trade. This is one of the biggest differentiators you can implement in trading competitions, as it lets you trade significantly more trades. There are some intricacies you have to pay attention to, such as making sure that we remove our own orders from what’s reported in the market feed. This is crucial in preventing our bot from bidding against itself.</p>
<h4 id="case-3-building-scales">Case 3: Building scales</h4>
<p>An uninformed customer comes into the market and buys up all of the offers on the market, and still wants to buy more. Because you don’t have more orders on the market, you missed out on selling to the customer at a great price. We can avoid this problem by building scales - multiple levels of bids and offers at increasing edges. For instance, we can offer 100 lots at $3.60, $3.80, $4.00, $4.20 etc. Most of the time, these extra orders will not be traded against, but due to the immaturity of our competition market, we get to trade at $3.80 or $4.00 with reasonable frequency and end up making a massive EV from the trade.</p>
<p>That’s basically how our bot traded. These strategies have insane benefit for their implementation complexity, but most other competitors stopped at case 1 or case 2. Tuning the parameters for <code>edge</code>, <code>fade</code>, <code>size</code> and <code>slack</code> is also crucial in maximizing pnl. While we can tune these on the provided test exchange, these may not work on the real competition due to more competition, so we need the flexibility to tune parameters during live trading.</p>
<h2 id="day-of-the-competition">Day of the competition</h2>
<p>We built a monitoring interface to tune parameters during live trading. The column titles are futures ticker | our bid size | our bid price | fair | our ask price | our ask size | position change in last tick | current position.</p>

</video>
<p>During live trading, we mainly focused on our position change and current position. If our trading volume decreases, then we can decrease our edge appropriately to to gain more volume. If our position becomes too imbalanced and does not revert quickly, we can increase our fade to revert our position quickly.</p>
<p>To dynamically change our trading parameters (and any other part of the bot), we used <code>exec</code> to read an execute an arbitrary <code>params.py</code> file. Here’s what <code>params.py</code> looks like.</p>
<pre><code>self.max_pos = 950
self.params = {}
self.params['EFM'] = {
        "edge": .005, # One sided edge from fair
        "fade": .005, # Fade per 100 delta
        "size": 100, # Size of trade
        "edge_slack": .10 # edge to ask for beyond min edge
        }
otherparam = {
        "edge": .002,
        "fade": .001,
        "size": 100,
       …</code></pre></div></div>

These buckets have a feature that allows you to make your files readable by anyone on the internet without authentication. If the content is meant for public consumption, like storing HTML, CSS, and JS assets for a website, this feature can be really useful, but it’s a double edged sword. Frequently, these files contain sensitive information, which has caused several high profile security incidents, including:</p><p>	<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/twilio-security-incident-shows-danger-of-misconfigured-s3-buckets/d/d-id/1338447">A recent incident with Twilio</a></p><p>	<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/dow-jones-data-leak-results-from-amazon-aws-configuration-error/d/d-id/1329382?">The Dow Jones data breach</a></p><p>	<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15962520/verizon-nice-systems-data-breach-exposes-millions-customer-records">A Verizon Wireless data breach</a></p><p>Typically the data exposed is the end of the reported story, but we’ve found it’s often not the end of the security story.</p><div><p>Since we recently added S3 support to TruffleHog, we thought scanning the set of publicly exposed buckets for credentials would be a great way to get ahead of potential security incidents, and we ended up finding thousands of distinct secrets spanning hundreds of customers.</p></div><h2>Methodology</h2><p>The first thing we needed to do is compile a list of open S3 buckets. Luckily, the bucket names are globally unique and can be specified by subdomain. For example, if a bucket was named “trufflehogbucket”, the files could be accessed at: <a href="https://trufflehogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/">https://trufflehogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/filename</a>. Because DNS traffic is typically unencrypted, many bucket names are collected by DNS taps. Some vendors like RiskIQ expose this data via their PassiveTotal API.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596429866183_13322"><div>

<p>Sébastien Doeraene, Ph.D. thesis</p>

<p><a title="Cross-Platform Language Design - Sébastien Doeraene - Ph.D. thesis" href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~doeraene/thesis/doeraene-thesis-2018-cross-platform-language-design.pdf">Full text</a></p>

<p>This is the thesis behind <a title="Scala.js" href="https://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a>, the dialect of Scala that compiles to JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Programming languages are increasingly compiled to multiple runtimes, each featuring their own rich structures such as their object model.
Furthermore, they need to interact with other languages targeting said runtimes.
A language targeting only one runtime can be designed to tailor its semantics to those of that runtime, for easy interoperability with other languages.
However, in a language targeting multiple runtimes with differing semantics, it is difficult to cater to each of them while retaining a common behavior across runtimes.
We call <em>cross-platform language</em> a language that aims at being both <em>portable</em> across platforms and <em>interoperable</em> with each target platform.
Portability is the ability for a program or a library to cross-compile for multiple platforms, and behave the same way on all of them.
Interoperability is the ability to communicate with other languages on the same platform.
While many cross-compiling languages focus on one of these two properties—only adding support for the other one as an afterthought—, languages that are designed from the ground up to support both are rare.
</p>
<p>
In this thesis, we present the design of Scala.js, the dialect of Scala targeting the JavaScript platform, which turned Scala into a cross-platform language.
On the one hand, Scala programs can be cross-compiled for the JVM and JavaScript with portable semantics.
On the other hand, whereas Scala/JVM interoperates with Java, Scala.js interoperates with JavaScript, allowing to use any JavaScript library.
Along the dissertation, we give insights that can be transferred to the design of other cross-platform languages, although with a bias towards those targeting the JVM and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
The first and most obvious challenge is to reconcile the static nature of Scala's object model with JavaScript's dynamic one.
Besides the ability to mutate a class hierarchy at run-time in JavaScript, there are fundamental differences between the two models, in particular the difference between compile-time overloading and run-time overloading.
We discuss how such semantic mismatches can live in harmony within the language.
</p>
<p>
The second challenge is to obtain good performance from a language where interoperability with a dynamic and unknown part of the program is pervasive.
To that end, we design and specify an intermediate representation (IR) with first-class support for dynamically typed interoperability features in addition to statically typed JVM-style operations.
Despite its tight integration with the open world of JavaScript, most of the IR can be considered as a closed world where advanced whole-program optimizations can be performed.
The performance of the overall system is evaluated and shown to be competitive with hand-written JavaScript, and even with Scala/JVM in some cases.
</p>
<p>Keywords: interoperability, portability, language design, cross-platform, performance, Scala, JavaScript.</p>

		</div><p>Some 700 years ago, the Tuscan town of Siena was a burgeoning banking and proto-industrial powerhouse with over 50,000 inhabitants — a population surpassed only by medieval “mega-cities” like Paris, London and Milan.</p>
<p>But then, in 1348, just when the thriving city was in the prime of its golden age, Siena’s prosperity was brought to a sudden halt by the Black Death. In just a few years, the city lost 60 percent of its population and entered into a steep decline, falling into obscurity. It took until the 20th century for it to <a href="http://www.montana.edu/historybug/yersiniaessays/davis.html#:~:text=In%201348%2C%20the%20pestilence%20struck,population%20(Benedictow%2C%202004).&amp;text=Siena%20suffered%20immensely%20more%20than,Florence%20both%20culturally%20and%20economically." target="_blank">recover</a> its pre-pandemic size.</p>
<p>COVID-19 isn’t nearly as deadly as the medieval bubonic plague, but the social and economic upheaval it’s caused is already leaving physical marks on modern cities in Europe: Once-busy business districts have emptied out as people opt to work from home. Shops and restaurants have closed. Public transport has slowed down.</p>
<p>There’s also reason to believe this pandemic could have an even more lasting impact than its predecessors. For the first time since the earliest cities emerged in the Fertile Crescent some 6,000 years ago, concentrated urban centers no longer have a monopoly on the economic and cultural connections that make civilizations tick forward.</p>

<p>For many workers worried about the coronavirus — and employers looking to cut costs during the economic crisis that has followed — technologies like video conferencing, shared documents and instant messaging provide viable alternatives to high-rise office buildings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, services like video streaming and social media and websites like Reddit and Twitter offer a taste of the cultural effervescence and community that has drawn so many to the big city over the centuries. You don't even need a bar or club to meet the love of your life: Apps like Tinder, Bumble or Grindr are happy to link you to a potential mate.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has the potential to really affect cities,” said Peter Clark, a professor of European urban history at the University of Helsinki.&nbsp;“If there isn’t a second wave, the changes may be far fewer than people are speculating. But if there is, we could see the European model of the ‘cultural city’ seriously affected.</p>
<p>“Because of deindustrialization, since the 1980s, we’ve had a shift to the service sector in order to maintain urban prosperity,” he added. “The pandemic poses a direct threat to that model.”</p>
<h3><strong>Ghost towns</strong></h3>
<p>There’s no question whether the pandemic has transformed working life.</p>
<p>In the early spring, as the coronavirus spread through Europe, government restrictions forced all but essential workers such as health and supermarket workers to work from home to keep new infections at bay. Industrial demand slowed or shut down completely as purchases of cars and other products collapsed.</p>
<p>Before the lockdowns, teleworking was not particularly common in most European countries.&nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/data/percentage-of-workers-doing-telework-and-ict-based-mobile-work" target="_blank">data compiled by Eurofound</a>, just 11 percent of Germans and 8 percent of Italians “occasionally” worked remotely in 2015.</p>
<p>But as the crisis progressed, workers and businesses adjusted remarkably quickly to the new reality. Government, corporate and other meetings <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1310870">shifted online</a>; classes were taught <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1351286">virtually</a>; e-medicine and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1322367">virtual therapy</a> took off.</p>
<p>The question now is whether these new behaviors will stick — or whether most people will return to their offices as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom, an expert on teleworking, says that while it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to work from home indefinitely, between 50 percent and 60 percent of the population would be able to keep at it.</p>
<p>“A third of the working population — office workers, senior management — can telework 100 percent of the time. Another third — clothing designers, real estate agents, scientific researchers — can do it most of the time, but will sometimes need to be onsite. And another third cannot do it at all: Most of these people are lower-paid service-sector workers, but you also have higher-range jobs like those held by dentists, surgeons, pilots.”</p>
<p>Bloom says it’s still too early to tell how intense the impact of the pandemic will be, but that it’s unlikely that office workers will want to go back to business as usual, even if a cure or a vaccine is developed.</p>
<p>“The skyscrapers and office buildings in the city centers that used to be our most valued real estate have become places people avoid out of fear of infection,” Bloom said. “I don’t see people growing comfortable with packed subway trains and elevators, and firms aren't going to want to open and close every time there’s a wave.”</p>

<p>“It’s the fear of the virus that keeps people at home,” said Sven Smit, senior partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and co-chair of the McKinsey Global Institute. He added that while it was too early to be certain the shift would stick, “the tendency [for longer-term change] is there.”</p>
<p>Companies have already taken notice of the opportunities for cost-cutting. A <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/covid-19-impacts-on-commercial-property-202006.html" target="_blank">new&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;from Credit Suisse indicates that office space rental income loss has “so far been limited.” At the same time, however, “executive boards — including those of large global corporations — have identified the latent potential to make savings and are already looking to reduce the amount of space they use.”</p>
<p>Commercial property investments fell by an average of 44 percent across Europe between the middle of March and the end of May, according to <a href="https://www.realestate.bnpparibas.com/covid-19-report-june-2020" target="_blank">figures</a>&nbsp;released by BNP Paribas Real Estate last month; the decline was especially notable in Ireland, where the Irish Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/irish-commercial-property-deals-slump-most-in-eu-amid-covid-19-1.4286605" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that commercial property deals slumped by 79 percent during that period.</p>

<p>In a sign the trend is likely to continue, tech companies like<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home" target="_blank"> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/working-google/working-from-home-and-office/" target="_blank">Google</a> have announced plans for their employees to continue working remotely, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/most-german-companies-say-work-from-home-should-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank">new&nbsp;survey</a> conducted by Germany’s Ifo Institute shows that 54 percent of businesses want to make greater use of home offices henceforth.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10111936118050541/" target="_blank">has said</a> he expects half the company’s workforce to be working from home in the next decade — and that employees who moved to less expensive areas would see their salaries cut to reflect the cost of living.</p>
<p>Michel Serafinelli, an economics lecturer at the University of Essex, said that the value of office space could be expected to decline. “Why rent a big office that only a few workers will be able to use at a time, and only on certain days each week?”</p>
<h3><strong>COVID-flight</strong></h3>
<p>The end of the office, should it come to pass, would transform the urban landscape. Workers, unshackled from their morning commute, will be free to gravitate to suburbs and the countryside.</p>
<p>Europe has a long tradition of rich city-dwellers fleeing plagues to the countryside, leaving the poor and working class behind. In Giovanni Boccaccio’s 14th-century literary landmark, "The Decameron," wealthy Florentines escaped to the Tuscan countryside to hide from the Black Death.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus crisis, urban elites in hard-hit places like Spain and France left the city for greener and safer pastures. Former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/europe/rich-coronavirus-second-homes.html" target="_blank">traveled to his holiday villa in Marbella</a> rather than ride out the lockdown in Madrid.</p>
<p>If there are further waves of the coronavirus or home-working continues to proliferate, that trend could easily stick. Why pay big-city rents for an undersized apartment if you can pursue an equally attractive career from a house in the hills? And from the employer’s point of view, why pay big-city salaries if you can source the same talent for cheaper, even if you never or rarely see your employees in person.</p>
<p>But even if teleworking does become ubiquitous, not everybody will be able — or will want — to flee to the suburbs and the country. And those who stay behind may find the city they call home has become a very different place.</p>

<p>“Cities are almost certainly going to become cheaper, because more spaces become available,” Bloom said. “That might help address the affordability crisis we see in urban centers ... but that’s going to leave quite a vacuum.” Artists, he added, “might move into the vacant spaces, but they don’t spend much money, and that’s quite a problem for cities that rely on revenue to offer services.”</p>
<p>Businesses are already suffering from the knock-on effects of emptier business areas and city centers. Shops, restaurants and other services that depend on corporate and other clientele are reeling from the pandemic’s economic impact.</p>
<p>“The restaurants where executives go out to lunch, the cafés where secretaries grab their cappuccino, the retail shops where workers shop on their breaks…&nbsp;If the offices go, we&nbsp;can plausibly expect urban expenditure to drop by a third,” Bloom said. “That’s a hit which most commercial spaces can’t take.”</p>

<p>If you add features to your product indiscriminately, you will end up with a gigantic bloated mess of software. One way to deal with this is to be very careful when deciding if new features should be added. Another rarely used approach is to remove unused and outdated features. Removing the cruft from your SaaS product is akin to pruning a hedge: you will end up with a more recognizable shape and a clearer vision of what your product is all about.</p>



<p><strong>How Customers React When You Remove Features</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the thing with change: there will always be people who hate it, with or without reason. While notorious complainers can be safely ignored, pay close attention to people who react negatively to product removal. Your target customers should be the ones that you delight with your product, and you never know how people use your product in weird ways until you break a workflow that you never expected to be possible. You want to remove a file upload button because everyone drags their files into the browser? There will be that one user who uses their keyboard only. Removing the feature makes the whole product unusable to them all of a sudden.</p>



<p>Make sure never to remove accessibility features because you don’t see the need for them yourself. Impaired users rely on these things to be able to use your product. Build as much accessibility as possible into the product from the beginning.</p>



<p><strong>When to Remove a Feature</strong></p>



<p>In some way or another, every reason to remove a feature from your product boils down to feature creep. Here are a few examples, both with reasons why they should be removed and how they come to happen.</p>



<p><strong>Remove unused features.</strong> When customers stop using features, they either found a better solution to their problem or they have a different problem to solve. As a result, unused features clutter the user interface of your product, not providing any value to your users. At best, they are a visual nuisance; at worst, they produce unintended side-effects, confusing your customers by their presence. Your codebase will also show signs of bloat when unused features stick around for too long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We removed such a feature at FeedbackPanda. It was initially introduced to allow our customers to migrate and amend their data from one product version to another. As some of our customers were rather slow to adopt the new version, we left the interface component in for a long time and forgot about it. Half a year after the last customer finished migrating, we finally removed the feature. While doing that, we figured out that some of our customers had misused that feature to change their data in weird ways that we didn’t understand before. Talk about a side-effect!</p>



<p><strong>Remove features that distract from product focus.</strong> Sometimes, you build things because you think your customers need them, but they turn out to be misaligned with your purpose of solving your customers’ critical problem. Those features can make other features less effective or at least harder to find and use. This is the ultimate incarnation of feature creep. It’s what will turn your product into a tangled mess if you don’t regularly trim the fat.</p>



<p><strong>Remove features that make the product too complex.</strong> Very similar to features that distract your users are features that overwhelm them. Many products have seen their customers churn because they became hopelessly complicated to use. It all starts with the intent to provide more value, but it eventually turns into feature overload.</p>



<p><strong>Remove features that are expensive to maintain.</strong> This removal opportunity is often overlooked. Some things that are part of your product may, at some point, cause performance issues or incur higher monetary costs than you’re willing to pay. Often, it’s easy to engineer and maintain heavy-duty features at the beginning of a business with only a few customers. Examples of this would be heavy background-processing of customer data, complicated imports, or extensive export scenarios. While limiting access to this feature may work, removing it is also an option if it’s do-or-die.</p>



<p><strong>Why Does Feature Creep Happen?</strong></p>



<p>Feature creep happens for many reasons, and all come from a genuine belief that, at the moment when you conceptualize and build the feature, it’s useful and providing value to your business and your customers. But, of course, just because you believe so doesn’t make it real. I have built many features that I felt to be absolutely necessary only to shamefully admit defeat and remove them a few months after launching them.</p>



<p>Here are a few situations where I should not have added a feature but did anyway:</p>



<p><strong>I just wanted to build it.</strong> Sometimes, you’re only interested in understanding how things work, and you think you need to build it. I did so with the FeedbackPanda invoicing system. What started as a simple part of the application, not much more than a list, ended up being a PDF-generating monster and tax-calculating monster of a feature. In retrospect, that’s a rabbit hole I should have never even looked at from a distance.</p>



<p><strong>I just wanted to get and convert a big customer.</strong> In a prior startup, I built several features for a prospective customer who promised to sign up if only those features were implemented. Of course, they never signed up even when I had deployed the changes, but we kept the feature in the application because we hoped that other customers could benefit from it somehow. They never did.</p>



<p><strong>I thought it was the one feature I needed to release for things to start happening.</strong> This is an example of the classical “Next Feature Fallacy”: the thinking that the next thing you do will have the big impact you’re waiting for. But it usually doesn’t. Usually, it will be yet another attempt at making a big difference and failing. This is a great opportunity to dust yourself off and try again. Just make sure you remove the feature that has proven not to work. Don’t keep it hanging around.</p>



<p>There are a number of other reasons that can cause you to build things you shouldn’t have:</p>



<p>• “<strong>Premature Optimization”-like integrations.</strong> You thought you could use this eventually, and you’d better already have it in the product before you need it. Maybe you intend to eventually partner with a service, so you build an integration ahead of time. And then the partnership falls through, and you never need it. Many technical founders then fall prone to the sunk cost fallacy, thinking that since they already invested their time, the functionality needs to stay there.</p>



<p><strong>• You’re trying to capitalize on trends.</strong> Ever implemented social-media-like functionality even if your customers never interact? I built a Facebook-like social stream with messages and comments for farmers who never took the time to use it because they were too busy harvesting their vegetables. But social media feeds were everywhere, so we just had to have something like this, too. It was not required at all, and completely unused, but we believed that we could pull it off.</p>



<p><strong>• You saw it somewhere else, and it looked rather cool.</strong> Founders get inspired by other software all the time, and then build something very similar in their own products. What they forget is that every feature exists within the context of a product. That cool overlay animation you see on a social network for designers will completely confuse your almost technically illiterate users. Try to avoid things that are not essential to your product.</p>



<p><strong>• You needed to release something, and it was quick to build.</strong> Sometimes, you feel like you just need to do something. You haven’t released a new feature in weeks, and customers have always asked for something simple. It’s not on your roadmap, and you didn’t put it on there because it wasn’t essential, but you know it will only take an hour or two. Now you have wasted your time twice. You didn’t work on anything meaningful, and you will have to remove it again in the future.</p>



<p>No matter what your reasons were then, you need a slim and efficient product now. So, trim the fat, and start removing those obsolete features.</p>



<p><strong>Removing a Feature the Empathetic Way</strong></p>



<p>If you want to remove a feature, sunset it. Make a public announcement about the removal close to when people who use the feature would read it. Then, turn it into an optional feature, using a configuration toggle. Change that toggle to default to an “off” state, and measure how many people react to it. Inform them how to re-enable it and how to work with your product without that feature. If you feel confident that removing the feature won’t impact a significant amount of your target customers, remove it.</p>



<p>Feature removal has multiple impacts: you can fully remove a feature, slowly wean customers off over a number of weeks, or phase out the feature via options until the last customer has stopped using it.</p>



<p>No matter what speed you choose, the most important thing to remember is to communicate the changes to your users before and after you remove anything. This will reduce friction between you and your customers. It prepares them for an impending change and reduces the likelihood of them getting confused when it finally happens. By keeping your customers in the loop, you’re reducing the customer service load you’ll have when you remove the feature. Also, once they know about the change, they can look for alternative ways to solve their problem if they were users of the feature before.</p>



<p>Use all the instruments at your disposal to communicate the removal to your customers. Tell them in-app and through an email. You never know where they are right now, and you need them to know both in advance through a thoughtful email and right when they are in the product, best in the location where the feature used to be. Update your knowledge base and prepare a transitionary video that clearly shows how to solve the problem alternatively if ever needed. The more you invest in communicating a feature removal, the less …</p></div></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>You're at the doctors office, talking to an aquaintence, or ordering something on the phone and they ask the question:  What's your email?  Depending on your name, age, and your life choices this can be a breeze or the dreaded question.  How long does it take before you have to break out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">phonetic alphabet</a>?  How many times do you have to repeat it?</p>
<p>Today we're going to come up with a scoring system to measure how painful your email is to tell someone.  It's a golf scoring system with low scores being easy and each point is one unit of struggle for both you and the recipient.</p>
<p>Lets start with the hypothetical perfect example: <code>bob@gmail.com</code> coming in with a score of 0.  It's short, contains only a common name, and is on a popular mail host.  From there, lets see all the ways yours is harder to say.</p>
<h3 id="nonpopularemaildomain">Non popular email domain</h3>
<p>If's it's not <code>@gmail.com</code>, <code>@outlook.com</code>, <code>@hotmail.com</code>, <code>@yahoo.com</code>, <code>@icloud.com</code>, or <code>@aol.com</code> take a point.  These are services people are familiar with and don't have to think about typing.  They just might judge you on which on you use.</p>
<h3 id="domainwithsubdomain">Domain with subdomain</h3>
<p>If you have an email from school hanging around you're likely to be guilty of this one like I am.  My school address got the <code>alumni</code> subdomain added to it.  I've seen a bunch of other emails from schools with the department included <code>@cs.xyz.edu</code>, or other fun stuff just 'cause like <code>@mail.xyz.edu</code>. Add a point for each level of domain past the normal two levels.</p>
<h3 id="noncommontopleveldomain">Non common top level domain</h3>
<p>If you're extra special you'll have a TLD like <code>.is</code>, <code>.io</code>, <code>.rocks</code> or some other novelty.  Take a point if it's not <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, <code>.net</code>, <code>.edu</code>, or <code>.gov</code>.</p>
<h3 id="longusername">Long Username</h3>
<p>After a certain amount of letters in the username you're just going to have to slow down and repeat that.  +1 point for every 2 characters over 6.  <code>bobsondugnutt@gmail.com</code> gets a 3 for example.</p>
<h3 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h3>
<p>Periods are pretty common in email usernames because we're used to saying "dot" for the domain anyways but they'll still slow down whoever is typing it and likely miss what comes after it.  Any other punctuation is a great typo opportunity.  +1 for any period in the username, +2 for any other punctuation in the username <em>or</em> domain.</p>
<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>Just like punctuation, numbers are in that more unfamiliar part of the keyboard where fingers get lost and push the wrong buttons.  +1 for each number.</p>
<h3 id="anyhardtosaywordsthatarentyourname">Any hard to say words that aren't your name</h3>
<p>Bit of a loose definition here but you should know it when you see it.  If you have a username that's not your name (where they might be able to refernce spelling) and is not a common and easily spellable word take a point. <code>xThreadRiPPerX@gmail.com</code> I'm talking about you whoever you are.</p>
<h3 id="similarsoundingletters">Similar sounding letters</h3>
<p>This is one I know all too well from one of my emails where I have to break out the phonetics after the 3<sup>rd</sup> repetition and they're still confused. "mn"? "mm"? "nm"?  Add +1 for each pair of similar sounding letters that aren't in an easily pronouncable and spellable word.  Some common pairs include: BV, DG, GZ, MN, JK</p>
<h3 id="bonusunicodeemoji">Bonus: Unicode &amp; Emoji</h3>
<p>Good luck getting someone to type that over the phone. +5 for each unicode character.</p>

<p>The email I've been using the most over the past few years is guilty of a few of these and comes in at a score of 3 so I'm well aware of the struggle.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments what score yours is and the struggles you've had!</p>

                            <div>
                                <div id="pl-124"><div id="pg-124-0"><div id="pgc-124-0-0"><div id="panel-124-0-0-0" data-index="0">			<p><span>The bio on your Instagram page is very important as it gives a first impression as to who you are, so it is safe to say that you must write your bio very carefully. This could prove to be difficult so we have put together the 7 best instagram bio tips and tricks to help you create the perfect Instagram bio.</span></p>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-1" data-index="1">			<div><h2>1. Use Keywords</h2>
<p>Utilising keywords assists people in understanding what you do and who you are. Choose keywords which match your brand and are useful to people that visit your page. They allow for your page to gain more attention as they help target your niche and allows for people to understand that you offer a valuable/beneficial business/service etc. </p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-2" data-index="2">			<div><h2>2. Use Emojis</h2>
<p>In your bio, you want to break up large chunks of text. A great way of doing this is by using a few emojis to do this. They add a bit of colour to your profile but you should always be careful about which ones you use because over-using them can look unprofessional. As well as this, make sure you use relevant emojis which show what you do or tell people what your personality is.</p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-3" data-index="3">			<div><h2>3. Add your Email</h2>
<p>A common thing for users to do is to put their email in their bio. This is an easy way to let your followers know that you can be contacted, and they can contact you with any queries or feedback etc. However, Instagram Business accounts allow for you to add an email button onto your profile which allows for a user to directly contact you through your profile.</p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-4" data-index="4">			<div><h2>4.  Take advantage of line-breaks</h2>
<p>Another way to break up your bio is to utilise Line-Breaks. These allow you to start typing on a new line. This is especially useful when you want to write a small bullet point list showing off your skills or keywords. They are very easy to implement as all you need to do is click Return/Enter on your keypad and it only takes up a single character on the bio character limit.</p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-5" data-index="5">			<div><h2>5. Include your skills</h2>
<p>Your Instagram bio is the first impression/introduction to visitors of your page. If you want these visitors to become followers, then you must set a good first impression. Use your Instagram bio to highlight qualities about you such as your skills, hobbies or interests. You need to make yourself stand out against competition so you need to show off your unique skills and values that make you better than others.</p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-6" data-index="6">			<div><h2>6. Use branded hashtags</h2>
<p>Including hashtags in your Instagram bio is also a way to let your followers know what niche you’re in. These intrigue people to engage with your posts and learn more about them, or click the hashtag and see posts with that hashtag. Including your personal branded hashtag can encourage followers to post using that hashtag.</p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-124-0-0-7" data-index="7">			<div><h2>7. Utilise your biolink</h2>
<p>And last and not least! Add a biolink to your Instagram bio. On Instagram, there is only one place in which you can place a biolink and that is on your profile underneath your bio. This is crucial because your Instagram bio can only hold a limited amount of information and linking to your website can provide people with a more detailed understanding of your business. Due to the limitation of only one link in the caption, businesses tend to change the link regularly to redirect the user to a new product. You can also get a ClickPage to share and manage all your links from one location. Add your ClickPage to your Instagram bio (as well as all your other social media platforms) and you won’t have to keep updating your biolink. <a href="https://click.page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to find out more about ClickPage.</p>

Our architecture included a Kafka based ingest process of over hundreds of different sources, managed by the data collection group.  The data was saved to S3 and partitioned by arrival time. We had 4 different engineering groups on the consuming side:</p><ul><li><strong>Data science:</strong> converting raw data into estimations. The group consisted of data scientists, data engineering and DevOps teams to support a DAG of almost 1000 jobs running daily to produce our production data.</li><li><strong>Web application: </strong>mainly consuming the output of the data science group.</li><li><strong>Business intelligence:</strong> BI engineers and analysts, running counts on the amount of data we ingested by device, application, country, etc’,</li><li><strong>Professional services:</strong> analysts providing ad hoc reports to customers based on any data set that supports their analysis.</li></ul><p>We were happy. Finally throughput was not a problem, cost effectiveness of the storage (S3) was high, and with some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/optimizing-performance.html">tweaks on prefixes</a>, throughput on read was satisfactory.</p><p>In retrospect we still think we made the right choice with this architecture. Before the migration we were dealing with “this is not feasible” issues and afterwards transitioned to the “this is not manageable” kind. And when data is your product, “this is not manageable” means production issues due to error prone operations.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2.png" alt="" width="819" height="461" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2.png 960w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-300x169.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-768x432.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-24x14.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-36x20.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2.png" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2.png 960w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-300x169.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-768x432.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-24x14.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-36x20.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Architecture-Slides-2-48x27.png 48w"><figcaption><em><span>Data Architecture </span></em></figcaption></figure><p>Here are some examples of the “this is not manageable” problem space:</p><h3>Fragile Writers and Readers: how to signal consumers the data is ready?</h3><p>Pain Point 1: The data science group starts running its <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/concepts.html#dags">DAG</a> only after data from several different sources (that were written independently) were complete. There’s no simple way for the writing teams to signal the completion of all writes to the reading teams. To work around this, we used time-based synchronization. At midnight, readers start consuming the data. Of course, this neglected late arrivals and in-flight writes. It was good enough most of the time, but a real pain when trying to reproduce results.</p><p>Pain Point 2: Consider the DAG of 1000 Spark jobs. Each job depends on several ancestor jobs’ output as its input. Basically the same as pain point #1, only with Airflow orchestrating a DAG of spark jobs. We used Spark SUCCESS files as a hook for Airflow. This doesn’t work in case the success file fails, or if for some reason someone intervenes manually.</p><p>Pain Point 3: In certain instances, correctness of the readers depends on a synchronization of several collections. For example, sometimes we needed the same data in two storage formats. ORC for AWS Athena, and Parquet for Spark. Another example: the professional services group have permission to access any data set serving their current ad hoc analysis. How do you make sure everything they access is synchronized to the same time/other parameters to maintain consistency? We used <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home">Hive Metastore </a>as a workaround. Each write process updates the Metastore when completed, and the reader waiting on those inputs would wait until all updates were announced. In some cases it meant trading consistency for availability, but we weren’t the first to encounter this tradeoff :-).</p><p>A word about the workarounds: every time we introduce new data or analysis the solution needs to be implemented again. If you neglect to do so, you will suffer the consequences. There was no one systematic and easy solution for all these use-cases. In addition, each solution failed sometimes, causing a correctness issue later in the data pipeline.&nbsp;</p><h3>Data Swamp: how to ensure visibility and governance?</h3><p>Pain point 1: Many organizations avoid limiting data access using permissions as they want to democratize the data in the organization, and as long as regulation permits, allow data consumers to generate as much value as possible from the data. We hold this philosophy. The challenge is that there’s no systematic way to ensure isolation, i.e., to ensure no one changes the data while you’re using it. This is why copying is so common in object storage. The copy you create yourself usually has a very meaningful name, such as “Einat_final_final_V2”, or better yet “Prodcution_temp”. You don’t have lineage capabilities that indicate which data is behind that name, unless you enforce naming conventions…Good luck with that 🙂</p><p>Over time, your lake becomes a swamp, cost increases and you have no real control over your data from a compliance standpoint.</p><p>Pain point 2: If you are working to avoid the swamp, you’re probably running retention jobs to ensure stuff doesn’t get out of hand. Consider a home grown retention job running periodically over the lake. If it has a bug and  deletes valuable data, according to some logic it will start to spread across many collections. Although you have backups of all the objects in the lake,&nbsp; you don’t have a snapshot of the lake to revert to. Recovering fully from such an error may take weeks. Amazon’s S3 object-level versioning will not save you here.</p><h3>The need for Data CI/CD: how to ensure data quality?</h3><p>Pain point: Data is useless, unless it’s trustworthy. When your delivery is data, it is not enough to ensure the correctness of the code. It’s also critical to protect the properties of the data that you assumed you had when you developed the code. Now, remember the 1000 spark jobs orchestrated by Airflow that run every day?&nbsp; These run an algorithm, so each job includes assumptions on the data. If those assumptions are no longer valid, jobs may fail, or worse, the quality of the output data will decrease dramatically. Why is the second scenario worse? Because it’s harder to detect.&nbsp;</p><p>If we could run a job in isolation, test the results, and merge back automatically only after validating schema and data correctness, then it would be possible to identify issues earlier, putting us in a much better position to deliver quality data.</p><h3>We were thinking: Git interface with MVCC capabilities</h3><p>While each one of these challenges may have a workaround we can use, or a homegrown solution we can develop, there is no <strong><em>conceptual</em></strong> solution that simply makes the work manageable and hence resileant. We want a concept and a language that provides a solution for all of those challenges, and for the challenges that are yet to come.</p><p>On the one hand, database systems use transactions to provide systematic guarantees over the data. This is usually implemented using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">Multi-Version Concurrency Control</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a standard for code versioning. The Git terminology is a common language for developers to deal with versions of things. So we were thinking, if we build an MVCC management layer for Data Lakes, using a Git-like interface, we will have an intuitive way of getting the guarantees we want for our data lake, in the performance and reliability we need. The name “lakeFS” followed soon after.</p><h3>Introducing lakeFS: manageable and resilient data lake</h3><p><a href="http://www.lakefs.io/">lakeFS</a> is an open source platform that delivers resilience and manageability to your existing object-storage based data lake. With lakeFS you can build repeatable, atomic and versioned data lake operations – from complex ETL jobs to data science and analytics.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-1024x355.png" alt="" width="743" height="258" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-1024x355.png 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-300x104.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-768x267.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-24x8.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-36x12.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-48x17.png 48w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05.png 1161w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-1024x355.png" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-1024x355.png 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-300x104.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-768x267.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-24x8.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-36x12.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05-48x17.png 48w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-03-at-9.29.05.png 1161w"><figcaption><em><span>Resilience and manageability layer for object-storage based data lakes</span></em></figcaption></figure><p>Main features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Cross-Lake Isolation </strong>– Creating a lakeFS branch provides you with a snapshot of the entire lake at a given point in time (no copying involved).

August 3, 2020 | https://secluded.site/replacing-youtube-invidious/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secluded.site/replacing-youtube-invidious/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Omar Roth, the developer of Invidious, recently wrote a blog post about
<em><a href="https://omar.yt/posts/stepping-away-from-open-source">Stepping away from open source</a></em>.
While I never used the official instance, I thought this was a good
opportunity to create a tool that downloads videos from YouTubers I’m
subscribed to so I can watch them offline in whatever manner I prefer.</p>
<p>To that end, <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a> is by
far the most reliable and versatile option. Having been around since
before 2008<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I don’t think the project is going anywhere.
<a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a> is my media player of choice and it relies on
youtube-dl for watching online content from Twitch to YouTube to
PornHub to <a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html">much more</a>.</p>
<p>Conveniently, youtube-dl comes with all of the tools and flags needed
for exactly this purpose so scripting and automating it is incredibly
easy. Taking a look at <code>man youtube-dl</code> reveals a <em>plethora</em> of options
but only a few are necessary.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-duplicates">Preventing duplicates</h2>
<p>The main thing when downloading an entire channel is ensuring the same
video isn’t downloaded more than once. <code>--download-archive</code> will save the
IDs of all the videos downloaded to prevent them from being downloaded
again. All that’s required is a file path at which to store the list.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">--download-archive .archives/&lt;channel&gt;.txt
</code></pre></div><h2 id="selecting-quality">Selecting quality</h2>
<p>By default, youtube-dl downloads the <em>single</em> file with the best quality
audio and video so it doesn’t need to mux<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> them together after.
However, I prefer to have the highest possibly quality and don’t mind
waiting a few seconds longer for FFmpeg to combine audio and video
files. <code>--format</code> lets the user decide which format they prefer and
whether they want to focus on storage efficiency or quality. The basic
options are <code>best</code>, <code>worst</code>, <code>bestvideo</code>, and <code>bestaudio</code>. These will
download a <em>single</em> file that is the highest or lowest quality of both
video/audio or video-only/audio-only. There are a lot of other options
for more fine-grained control over what to look for but, as I mentioned,
I want the highest video and the highest quality audio so I use
<code>bestvideo+bestaudio</code>. After downloading both of those files, they will
be muxed together.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">--format bestvideo+bestaudio
</code></pre></div><h2 id="embedding-subtitles">Embedding subtitles</h2>
<p>I enjoy subtitles but I know many people don’t so this section can
certainly be ignored.</p>
<p>There are a few options for fetching and embedding subtitles. To get
“real” subtitles that someone transcribed manually, use <code>--write-sub</code>.
For YouTube’s auto-generated subtitles that may or may not be horribly
inaccurate, use <code>--write-auto-sub</code>. For selecting the language,
<code>--sub-lang &lt;language-code&gt;</code>, for embedding them, <code>--embed-subs</code>, and
for selecting the format, <code>--sub-format &lt;desired-format&gt;</code>. I like using
SRT files so I have that first with <code>best</code> beside it like so:
<code>--sub-format srt/best</code>. SRT is preferred but, if unavailable, whatever
other highest-quality format will be used and embedded instead.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">--write-sub --write-auto-sub --sub-format srt/best --sub-lang en --embed-subs
</code></pre></div><h2 id="limiting-downloads">Limiting downloads</h2>
<p>When switching to this method, the initial download will pull
<em>all</em> of a channel’s videos. I certainly don’t want this so they should
be limited in some way. <code>--dateafter</code> and <code>--playlist-end</code> serve very
nicely. The former will only download videos published <em>after</em> a certain
date and the latter will only download X number of videos.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">--dateafter <span>20200801</span> --playlist-end <span>5</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="getting-notifications">Getting notifications</h2>
<p>I don’t yet have a good method for getting notifications when there are
<em>new</em> videos but there is a simple way to get notified when the script
is finished running. <code>notify-send</code> is one of the easiest and has pretty
simple syntax as well: the first string is the notification summary and
the second is a longer description. You can optionally pass an icon
name to make it look a little better.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">notify-send -i video-x-generic <span>"Downloads finished"</span> <span>"Check the YouTube folder for new videos"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For some reason, I don’t get icons when the generic name is specified
but I know the command will work on most systems. On mine, I have to
pass the path to the icon file I want: <code>-i /usr/share/icons/Suru++-Dark/apps/64/video.svg</code></p>
<h2 id="naming-format">Naming format</h2>
<p>The final parameter to look at is how to name the files once they’re
downloaded. <code>--output</code> provides templating functionality and there are a
<em>lot</em> of options. For this use, an acceptable template might be
something like <code>Channel/Title.ext</code>. In youtube-dl’s templating format,
that’s <code>"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s"</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">--output <span>"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s"</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="writing-the-script">Writing the script</h2>
<p>I want to store the videos in <code>~/Videos/YouTube</code> and I want the archive
records stored in <code>.archives</code> so the first line (after the shebang<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>)
creates those directories if they don’t already exist and the second
enters the <code>YouTube</code> folder.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir -p <span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Videos/YouTube/.archives"</span>
<span>cd</span> <span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Videos/YouTube"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>From here, a way to reuse the youtube-dl command is necessary so
parameters can be changed in one place and they’ll apply to all
channels. Functions are intended for exactly this purpose and are
formatted like so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">functionName () {
    <span># Code here</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>I’ve named the function <code>dl</code> so mine looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">dl () {
    youtube-dl --download-archive .archives/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>.txt -f         <span>\
</span><span></span>        bestvideo+bestaudio --dateafter <span>20200801</span> --write-sub    <span>\
</span><span></span>        --write-auto-sub --sub-format srt/best --sub-lang en    <span>\
</span><span></span>        --embed-subs -o <span>"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s"</span>        <span>\
</span><span></span>        --playlist-end <span>5</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
    sleep <span>5</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The backslashes at the end (<code>\</code>) tell bash that it’s a single command
spanning multiple lines. The <code>sleep</code> command just waits 5 seconds before
downloading the next channel. It’s unlikely that YouTube will ratelimit
a residential address for this but it is still possible. Waiting a bit before
continuing reduces the likelihood further.</p>
<p>Note the use of <code>"$1"</code> and <code>"$2"</code> in the archive path and at the very
end of the youtube-dl command. This lets the user define what the archive file
should be named and what channel to download videos from. A line using
the function would be something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">dl linustechtips https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips
</code></pre></div><p>The result would be this directory structure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">YouTube
├── .archives
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── linustechtips.txt
└── Linus Tech Tips
    └── They still make MP3 players.mkv
</code></pre></div><p>The last line is the notification command:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">notify-send -i video-x-generic <span>"Downloads finished"</span> <span>"Check the YouTube folder for new videos"</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="finished-script">Finished script</h2>
<p>This the script I have in use right now.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
mkdir -p <span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Videos/YouTube/.archives"</span>
<span>cd</span> <span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Videos/YouTube"</span>

dl () {
    youtube-dl --download-archive .archives/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>.txt -f         <span>\
</span><span></span>        bestvideo+bestaudio --dateafter <span>20200801</span> --write-sub    <span>\
</span><span></span>        --write-auto-sub --sub-format srt/best --sub-lang en    <span>\
</span><span></span>        --embed-subs -o <span>"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s"</span>        <span>\
</span><span></span>        --playlist-end <span>5</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
    sleep <span>5</span>
}

<p>I've been working on a Python project for some time now. In the beginning, it wasn't very comfortable, as I was trying to learn the language and figure out my workflow and the tooling.</p>

<p>After a couple of months, I now finally have a working Vim setup with proper syntax highlighting, smart code completion, and refactoring capabilities. Read on to see what it looks like.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: My setup may seem like a bit too much. You don't have to install every plugin listed in this article or copy every configuration line. Pick up what you like.</p>

      </div>
    

<h2>TL;DR:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Basics: <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">scrooloose/nerdtree</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">tpope/vim-commentary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">junegunn/fzf.vim</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent">Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent</a> for proper indenting</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">dense-analysis/ale</a> is an asynchronous linter plugin. Use it with <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a>; plus <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf">google/yapf</a> as a formatter.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">neoclide/coc.nvim</a> with <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc-python">neoclide/coc-python</a> for intellisense code completion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Essentials</h2>

<p>Let's start with a list of some general-purpose plugins which I find irreplaceable for any language.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> is a minimalistic plugin manager</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">scrooloose/nerdtree</a> to navigate the file tree</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">junegunn/fzf.vim</a> fuzzy search through the files (and much more, really)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">tpope/vim-commentary</a> ( or <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter">scrooloose/nerdcommenter</a> ) — press <code>gcc</code> to comment out a line or <code>gc</code> to comment a selection in visual mode</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">liuchengxu/vista.vim</a> which is a "tagbar" that learns from LSP servers</li>
</ul>

<p>The other plugins I use include</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-pythonsense">jeetsukumaran/vim-pythonsense</a> provides some Python-specific text objects: classes, functions, etc</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs">jiangmiao/auto-pairs</a> inserts closing quotes and parenthesis as you type</li>
</ul>

<p>The colorscheme used on the screenshots is <a href="https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim">joshdick/onedark.vim</a>, which is inspired by the Atom theme.</p>

<h2>Syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>Vim comes with syntax highlighting for many popular languages, including Python, though it is not always the best one.</p>

<p>There are several options to improve the default highlighting.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/numirias/semshi">numirias/semshi</a>, in my opinion, is the best. It works with Neovim only and requires the Python 3 support.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot">sheerun/vim-polyglot</a> includes support for many languages including Python</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode">python-mode/python-mode</a> is also a decent one although it comes with a lots of other stuff beside highlighting which I don't quite like</li>
</ul>

        <p><img src="https://www.vimfromscratch.com/assets/python-hl-3425e6874afcb201c0229566d9e763bdde60341146579dfc193f083b953c979b.png" alt="Semshi" (on="" the="" left)="" vs.="" default="" one=""></p><figcaption>Semshi (on the left) vs. the default one</figcaption>
      </div>
    

<p>My favorite color schemes (which I switch quite often) include <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim">junegunn/seoul256.vim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim">joshdick/onedark.vim</a> (the one on the screenshots).</p>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<p>You can set up indentation rules manually like this.</p>

<pre><code>au BufNewFile,BufRead *.py
    \ set expandtab       |" replace tabs with spaces
    \ set autoindent      |" copy indent when starting a new line
    \ set tabstop=4
    \ set softtabstop=4
    \ set shiftwidth=4
</code></pre>

<p>A better alternative is <a href="https://github.com/Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent">Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent</a> plugin. It does a much better job complying with the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> style guide.</p>

<h2>Folding</h2>

<p>Folding (<code>:help foldmethod</code>) is when you collapse chunks of code to eliminate distraction.</p>

<p>The best approximation is to use the folding method <code>indent</code> though it doesn't work ideally.</p>

<pre><code>au BufNewFile,BufRead *.py \
  set foldmethod=indent
</code></pre>

<p>To toggle a fold you can press <code>za</code> (<code>:help fold-commands</code>), and I have it mapped to <code>Space</code> for convenience.</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;space&gt; za
</code></pre>

<h2>Linting &amp; Fixing</h2>

<p>The fantastical <a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">dense-analysis/ale</a> plugin can be used for linting (which essentially means checking for syntax errors) and auto-fixing extremely well. It's asynchronous, meaning that it won't block the UI while running an external linter, and it supports <a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/blob/master/supported-tools.md">a great range of languages</a> and tools.</p>

<div>
        <p><img src="https://www.vimfromscratch.com/assets/python-ale-ca3f922e83aa4ea767326a1ba41412709c10ba0d09b3884230ef4d0a2489b7da.png" alt="Python" +="" ale="❤️"></p><figcaption>Python + ALE = ❤️</figcaption>
      </div>
    

<p>ALE highlights problems with your code in the gutter. When you move the cursor to the problematic line, it shows the full error message at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>By default, ALE will use all linters (which are just executables) it could find on your machine. Run <code>:ALEInfo</code> to see which linters are available and which are enabled.</p>

<p>It is better though to explicitly specify which ones you're going to use with a particular filetype:</p>

<pre><code>let g:ale_linters = {
      \   'python': ['flake8', 'pylint'],
      \   'ruby': ['standardrb', 'rubocop'],
      \   'javascript': ['eslint'],
      \}
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the linters are also capable of fixing the problems in your code. ALE has a special command <code>:ALEFix</code> that fixes the whole file. So far, I'm only Google's <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf">YAPF</a> as a fixer that formats the whole file when I press <code>F10</code> or save the current buffer.</p>

<pre><code>let g:ale_fixers = {
      \    'python': ['yapf'],
      \}
nmap &lt;F10&gt; :ALEFix&lt;CR&gt;
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
</code></pre>

<p>The last option is a huge time saver — it will automatically fix (and thus format) your file on save.</p>

<p>I also have a little piece of configuration that shows the total number of warnings and errors in the status line. Very convenient.</p>

<pre><code>function! LinterStatus() abort
  let l:counts = ale#statusline#Count(bufnr(''))

  let l:all_errors = l:counts.error + l:counts.style_error
  let l:all_non_errors = l:counts.total - l:all_errors

  return l:counts.total == 0 ? '✨ all good ✨' : printf(
        \   '😞 %dW %dE',
        \   all_non_errors,
        \   all_errors
        \)
endfunction

set statusline=
set statusline+=%m
set statusline+=\ %f
set statusline+=%=
set statusline+=\ %{LinterStatus()}
</code></pre>

<p>And here are a couple of alternatives to ALE:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic">vim-syntastic/syntastic</a> very popular one but synchronous which can cause significant lags in UI</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neomake/neomake">neomake/neomake</a> asynchronous linting and make framework for Neovim/Vim (didn't try that one)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jedi</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a> is a "language server" (see <a href="https://www.vimfromscratch.com/articles/vim-and-language-server-protocol/">my LSP article</a>), a separate process running in the background and analyzing your code.</p>

<p>Other clients (editors or IDEs) can connect to the server and request some information, like completion options, or "go to definition" coordinates.</p>

<p>Basically, Jedi is an IDE as a service, without the GUI.</p>

<p>In order to use it, you need to install it with <code>pip install jedi</code>, and then also add a client. The <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">davidhalter/jedi</a> Vim plugin does a good job.</p>

<p>Here's what it can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <code>ctrl + space</code> for the completion options</li>
<li><code>&lt;leader&gt;d</code> goes to definition</li>
<li><code>&lt;leader&gt;g</code> goes to assignment</li>
<li><code>K</code> shows the documentation</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently I have switched to <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">neoclide/coc.nvim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc-python">coc-python</a>. Coc is an "an intellisense engine" for Vim and Neovim and does a really good job when it comes to completion and communicating with language servers.</p>

<h2>Coc (Conquer of Completion)</h2>

<p>To me, the selling point is the usage of the new <code>floating window</code> API of Neovim, which makes it very convenient.</p>

<p><code>Coc-python</code> can use both Jedi and the Microsoft's Python Language Server. The first time you run it, it will ask you to install the components it needs (like a linter).</p>

<p>Coc provides (with the help of Jedi) some basic IDE capabilities like</p>

<ul>
<li>Going To definition</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>nmap &lt;silent&gt; gd &lt;Plug&gt;(coc-definition)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Displaying documentation (in the floating window!)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; K :call &lt;SID&gt;show_documentation()&lt;CR&gt;
function! s:show_documentation()
  if (index(['vim','help'], &amp;filetype) &gt;= 0)
    execute 'h '.expand('&lt;cword&gt;')
  else
    call CocAction('doHover')
  endif
endfunction
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Smart rename (renames the exports across all files)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>nmap &lt;leader&gt;rn &lt;Plug&gt;(coc-rename)
</code></pre>

<p>And of course the auto-complete menu (which you can see on the very first screenshot) appears as you type.</p>

<p>Basically, it's a very solid and comprehensive plugin which covers almost all of our needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki">Read to the wiki</a> for more information about its capabilities.</p>

<p>The 2 drawbacks of using Coc are:</p>

<ul>
<li>An expensive Node process that Coc needs to run in order to operate</li>
<li>It has its own independent extension system and its own (JSON-based) configuration file. Not a Vim-way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, it does the job well, and I continue using it (until there's a better option).</p>

<h2>Where to go next?</h2>

<p>Here are some other articles I learned from a lot:</p>

<h3>What you missed in July as a Python Developer…</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Python <code>reduce()</code> 🧿</h3>
<p>The reduce function is one of the most useful tools you have as a programmer. Although it can be hard to understand at times, by using the reduce function you can implement a lot of useful things like <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code> and much much more. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-reduce-function/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a tutorial to show you its functional powers</a>.</p>
<h3>Subprocess Genie ⛲️</h3>
<p>Python Subprocess just sounds like something cool you would hear a hacker on TV say. However, this is actually a useful skill and something you can do quite easily in Python to take advantage of extra CPU power or to run an App inside of another app. <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/06/30/python-101-launching-subprocesses-with-python/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is how to do it</a>. </p>
<h3>Distributed Python With Fiber 🎳</h3>
<p>One of the biggest changes lately in the Python landscape is the move towards distributed computing to take advantage of the power of multiple machines. However, this is a hard thing to do and many tools and libraries are being developed to make distributed computing easier with Python. <a href="https://eng.uber.com/fiberdistributed/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">One of the new kids on the block is Fiber</a> from Uber. Just read the introduction part of this article if you want to get an overview of the problem it solves. </p>
<h3>Python Quiz 📋</h3>
<p>Pop quiz for you: What is the most efficient way to remove half of the duplicate items in a list. For example to go from <code>l = [1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8]</code> to <code>k=[1,8,8,3]</code>. Try to figure it out on your own before you check out the solution <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62793544/efficient-way-to-remove-half-of-the-duplicate-items-in-a-list" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Everything About OOP 🤹‍♀️</h3>
<p>Object Oriented Programming sometimes gets a bad rep, but it is a very useful programming paradigm that has stood the test of time. <a href="https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a tutorial</a> on how to do OOP and also how to make your code cleaner and more efficient using this programming paradigm. </p>
<h3>Weekend Project Idea 🎏</h3>
<p>This is a project that will surely <em>wow</em> your future employers. Create an application to find restaurants with the help of food images you have. You will also learn how to work with IBM Watson for Visual Recognition and use location services for maps and location analytics. <a href="https://developer.here.com/blog/visual-recognition-with-ibm-watson-here-and-python-part-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is the project walkthrough</a>.</p>
<h3>New Python Extension On VS Code 🔋</h3>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-pylance-fast-feature-rich-language-support-for-python-in-visual-studio-code/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Another feature rich VS Code extension</a> when you are writing Python. There are lots of these around, but this looks to be a promising one for one of the most popular editors. </p>
<h3>YouTube Data Analysis 🎥</h3>
<p>A great overview of how to collect and analyze data to produce meaningful insights. Something you can do really well within the Python ecosystem. <a href="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/2020/youtube-trending-videos-analysis-2019-us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This is also a fun project for you to follow along and discover new insights</a>. The big takeaway? If you want your YouTube video to trend, make sure you have a person in the thumbnail.</p>
<h3>All About Python Memory 🤖</h3>
<p>Two articles to really dive deep into how memory management works in Python. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/function-calls-prevent-garbage-collection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">How Python function calls can increase your memory usage</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-integers-memory/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">How NumPy helps numbers memory in Python</a>. By the way, <a href="https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-numpy-fundamentals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here is a massive free tutorial on NumPy</a>. Why should you care? It's one of the most used python libraries in the world. </li>
</ol>
<h3>PEP622 - Pattern Matching 🎰</h3>
<p><a href="https://ncik-roberts.github.io/posts/pep622.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New PEP proposal</a> brings Python in-line with many other modern programming languages, like Haskell, OCaml, and Rust. It is a useful feature that will allow you to search/match strings. </p>
<h3>Favourite Data Structure 🥇</h3>
<p>What is your favourite Data Structure? Wait, you don't have one? Don't look at me with those crazy eyes. Everyone should have a favourite data structure. Mine is a Hash Table or in the case of Python, Dictionaries. <a href="https://akshayr.me/blog/articles/python-dictionaries" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is why it's such a useful tool</a> in any programming language arsenal. </p>
<h3>Python Malware On The Rise 🦂</h3>
<p><em>"The vast majority of serious malware over the past 30 years has been written in Assembly or compiled languages such as C, C++, and Delphi. However, ever-increasing over the past decade, a large amount of malware has been written in interpreted languages, such as Python. The low barrier to entry, ease of use, rapid development process, and massive library collection has made Python attractive for millions of developers - including malware authors."</em> I guess it's part of being the popular language on the block. <a href="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/python-malware-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check out the full analysis here</a>.</p>
<h3>News Around the World 🗺</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unsecured MongoDB and Elastic Search databases are a common thing. This is because they have unsecured defaults and a programmer/administrator needs to enable those safety features. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-meow-attack-has-deleted-almost-4-000-unsecured-databases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Well, somebody</a> created a program to delete all those unsafe instances to force people to secure these databases better. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-regulator/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-for-news-in-world-first-idUSKCN24V3UP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Australia is making Facebook and Google</a> pay for the news that they display on their search results from Australian companies. An interesting move that may effect what other countries do with news in the future. </li>

The hackers? <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-the-fbi-tracked-down-the-twitter-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A bunch of teenagers</a>. </li>
<li>An interesting article on why <a href="https://blog.anylist.com/2020/06/sign-in-with-apple/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this company</a> isn't interested in implementing Sign in With Apple. But the big news out of Apple this month was their move to AMD chips for their laptops. <em>"We’re about to enter an exciting, messy transition. Not only will Apple Silicon make better Macs, it will force Microsoft to polish its Windows on ARM act, both hardware and software. In turn, this will cause PC OEMs to reconsider their allegiance to x86 silicon… and that will have serious consequences for the old Wintel partnership."</em> <a href="https://mondaynote.com/apple-silicon-the-passing-of-wintel-79a5ef66ad2b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check out the explanation of what this means here</a>.</li>
<li>Barclays was caught <a href="https://twitter.com/immunda/status/1278783894683336704" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">using the internet archive as a CDN</a> <em>(bad because they make enough money to not use a non profit's servers for free).</em></li>

This is a positive trend that hopefully more and more companies will adopt (most people in the world can't afford to pay $100,000 for a fancy CS Degree, nor do you need it to be a great programmer). Maybe soon Google will announce their scholarship program for <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/academy">ZTM Academy Memberships</a> 😁!</li>

<h3>Best Resource of the Month 🥽</h3>
<p>A higher level of abstraction. We hear this phrase quite often in our industry. Do you fully understand it? What exactly is abstraction and why is it a useful concept when it comes to programming? Can abstractions be good and bad? This was my favourite article this month discussing this very important topic. <a href="https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enjoy the read</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, I have to share 2 things this month that I loved because <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this one is just as good</a>. The takeaway? Write code that is easy to delete.</p>
<p>I lied. There are 3 articles for this month. It kind of ruins the whole point of this section, but all 3 of these articles are tied for the top spot this month. What should you do to succeed during a technical interview? <a href="https://meekg33k.dev/what-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-ckda9sn7s00iftss13b0wd0ky" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This is one of the best pieces I have read on the topic</a>.</p>

            <p>September 9, 2019</p>
            
<p>When it comes to website / product design and development most devs should try to keep things simple. By only using as much code as absolutely necessary, projects avoid growing out of scope or becoming bloated. So, why isn’t this same approach taken for email?</p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-email">A brief history of email</h2>



<p>Email has been possible since the 1960s with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing">time-sharing computers</a> being used to share files and messages across early devices. Around the 80s and 90s it seemed as though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Open_Systems_Interconnection_Profile">GOSIP</a> would dominate the market, but this was knocked out in favor of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP in 1995 when the <a href="http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html">National Science Foundation ended its sponsorship of the Internet backbone</a>, and all traffic relied on commercial networks.</p>



<figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Timesharing_and_Development_KA-10s_at_BBN%2C_circa_1970.jpg" alt="First computers to send and receive email"><figcaption>The first computers to send and receive email. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Timesharing_and_Development_KA-10s_at_BBN,_circa_1970.jpg">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Things were looking pretty good at this point. Most operating systems now had a shared foundation of sending and receiving emails on the internet, allowing for a set of standards to be slowly developed and agreed upon over time. These were simpler times, with the default content sent between machines being plain text. No embedded images, no CSS3 fallback support, no <em>fluff</em> – just content.</p>



<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong><br>Now, I’m not going to sit here and pretend to be some expert on the history of email (or the internet in general), so I suggest you take the time to read about <a href="http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html">the history of the internet</a> if you’re into that kind of thing.</p>



<h2 id="looking-at-some-data">Looking at some data</h2>



<section>
<h3>Data isn’t everything</h3>
<p>I understand that the data being used is currently 16 years old – but not many extensive research studies have been performed (specifically for email-type preference in general)</p>
</section>



<p>In 2002<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup>, <a href="https://www.clickz.com/real-world-email-client-usage-the-hard-data/47429/">a small-set survey was run by ClickZ</a> was created to gauge the details of personal email data. The main data we will focus on is the user preference between HTML or plain text formats:</p>



<p><strong>Do you prefer receiving HTML or text email?</strong></p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Response</th><th>Percentage (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HTML</td><td>41.95</td></tr><tr><td>Plain Text</td><td>31.52</td></tr><tr><td>No Preference</td><td>26.53</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>On initial review, one could make the argument that the general public <em>prefers</em> HTML email over plain text (~42% vs ~32%) – but I would disagree with this analysis. The ~27% of respondents who answered with <em>No Preference</em> should not be dismissed so easily.</p>



<p>Since the <em>No Preference</em> respondents don’t care whether emails they receive are designed in HTML format, why not send them plain text variations by default? The positives of plain text greatly outweigh those of HTML:</p>



<ul><li>Plain text has reduced file size
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget that many users have limited data usage across much of the world</li>
</ul>
</li><li>HTML is more likely to be flagged as spam by email clients
<ul>
<li>This is due to extra code, tracking scripts, 3rd party assets / resources being called</li>
</ul>
</li><li>HTML / CSS can be inconsistent or even limited in support across email clients</li><li>Text only requires less design work for your development team
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget about testing all the various email clients too</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>



<p>Add to this that <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33">53% of emails are opened on mobile</a> – so any “fancy” marketing email designs need to look great on mobile screens and also take into account slower connections. What looks better and loads faster than simple plain text?</p>



<h2 id="but-what-about-marketing">But what about marketing!?</h2>



<p>Sorry to say, but marketing should never trump user experience. Teams love to track email opens / click ratios, who subscribed / unsubscribed or who shared the campaign with others – but <strong>it’s all bloat on the user’s end</strong>.</p>



<p>Greg Kogan wrote up a great article / case study about his experience <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">switching over a client’s campaign from HTML templates to plain text</a> with some really interesting results. I highly recommend you give it a read for a better understanding about how the marketing goals and customer goals don’t always align.</p>



<h2 id="simple-or-lazy---it-doesnt-matter">Simple or lazy – it doesn’t matter</h2>



<p>Plain text can certainly have a reputation for looking lazy or cheap, but I feel this is mostly perpetuated in the design and marketing communities. I can assure you that your average day-to-day users are much less opinionated about your email campaign design than you are. Look to satisfy your customers’ needs before your own.</p>



<blockquote><p>Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.</p><cite>Confucius</cite></blockquote>



<p>That being said, at the end of the day, companies will justify their own reasons to use HTML email templates over plain text. You can’t convince everyone. My own personal experience with email template design, along with analyzing some of the data, leaves me to believe that most businesses should default to plain text. At the very least, you should try to convince your team to perform some simple A/B testing with your next email campaign.</p>



<p>The results might just surprise you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-124866fbd20ff6e682de"><div><h4>Who is Dan Ariely?</h4><p>Dan Ariely is a Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University whose writing merges psychology with economics. His book <a href="https://amzn.to/33pw3lh"><em>Predictably Irrational</em></a> explores why most of the smart decisions we think we make are actually quite irrational. Modern economics is based on the theory that the average person makes logical decisions. Ariely happily points out how wrong that notion is. </p><h4>Why Now?</h4><p>Comparison has always fascinated me. I grew up in Airmont, NY two minutes over the state line with Upper Saddle River, NJ. Since I didn’t like paying .50 more cents for gas, nor pumping it, I always got gas in NJ. Upper Saddle River is one of the wealthiest towns not only in America, but on the planet. The second you crossed the NY/NJ line it was like you were transported into an alternate reality where the worst car anyone drove was a BMW, every home a mansion and even the air smelled better (just kidding but I did wonder, if any town had the money to endlessly pump fabreeze into the air, they did). </p><p>When I crossed the NY/NJ state line back to my neighborhood of 3 bedroom raised ranches I felt poor by comparison. Then as a US Peace Corps Volunteer living in Ukraine in an ex-Soviet country, ridden with corruption, and the average salary being less than $100/mo I suddenly felt rich. Ukrainians were shocked that we owned two cars. That we had roads that worked. And that everyone was rich <em>to them. </em></p><h4>Why Comparison?</h4></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596450590223_8104"><div><p>Ariely uses this illustration to make his point about comparison. Which orange circle <em>appears</em> bigger? You’d likely say the one on the right, at least at first. But, both circles are the same size. The only thing that’s changed is what you’re comparing them to. Comparison depends on context. </p><blockquote><p>“…we are always looking at the things around us in relation to others…We always compare jobs with jobs, vacations with vacations, lovers with lovers and wines with wines.”</p></blockquote><p>Comparison is a survival skill that’s served us well our first 50 million years as a species: You need to know your status in the tribe compared to others’ to ensure your own safety. You need to compare how deadly a particular tiger looks compared to other live tigers you’ve seen in wild to assess your threat level. You need to compare how someone looks to other angry people you’ve seen to avoid a bar fight. You need to compare a date to other people you’ve dated in the past to evaluate how they might be as a future spouse for you. You need to know how to compare how fast your car is going relative to all the other cars on the street to stay within the speed limit. </p><p><strong>Comparison does hijack our rationality, however. </strong></p><h4>The Economist</h4><p>Ariely was trying to figure out what decision people made when given these three options for a subscription to <em>The Economist</em>: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>59/yr online only</p></li><li><p>125/yr print only</p></li><li><p>125/yr print and online together</p></li></ul><p>Out of 100 people here is how many chose which options:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>59/yr online only (16)</p></li><li><p>125/yr print only (0)</p></li><li><p>125/yr print and online together (84)</p></li></ul><p>But, when Ariely removed the print only option, here is what people chose:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>59/yr online only (68)</p></li><li><p>125/yr print and online together (32)</p></li></ul><p><em>As a business, you want to nudge as many people to the high-end of your sales as possible. So why were people opting for the online only? </em></p><p>It turns out it is easier to compare things that are alike than are not alike. By presenting people with not one but <em>two</em> print options, you’ve now made it easier for them to compare two options that you, as a business, want them to focus on. The mind has now written-off the online only option because that is the hardest option to compare to the other two. </p><p>Inside the mind of your potential customer is now a simple question: What’s better? Print only or print AND an online subscription? Everyone in the first experiment opted for the “print + online” because isn’t print plus a little something extra better? </p><p><strong>We Can’t Make Decisions In A Vacuum</strong></p><p>The second case study Ariely looks at is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/41166755">Williams-Sonoma’s inability to sell a $275.00 bread baker</a>. Their marketing team finally figured out that if they created a second, bigger and even more expensive bread baker placed <em>next to</em> the $275.00 dollar one, their sales would take off. And they did. </p><blockquote><p>“…people didn’t have to make their decision in a vacuum. They could say: “Well, I don’t know much about bread makers, but I do know that if I were to buy one, I’d rather have the smaller one for less money.”</p></blockquote><p>Ariely then goes on to joke that if you want to have better luck socially finding someone to date you, you should find a decoy friend of similar physical characteristics but who is slightly less attractive than you. Although the morality of this is questionable. </p><p>If you are a business, the takeaway is simple: to make more profit, create a favorable context for the product you want your customer to buy. Create an ultra-premium ridiculously high-priced product that when placed next to the product you really want to sell, makes its price not seem so bad. </p><p>Tesla knows not everyone is paying $100K + for their Cyber Truck, but they do know that by having their ridiculous premium products, it makes the $60K price tag for their “lower models” not seem so crazy. </p><p><strong>Place vs. Person</strong></p><p>I have some of the best friendships I’ve had from my former football teammates. We go through experiences, games, high and lows like few others friend groups might. But would we all have been friends were it not for football? How about military veterans who are bonded together in combat - were it not for that experience, would they have chosen to be friends? </p><p>Ariely uses the example of meeting a fellow American in a foreign place and finding an uncanny connection in an airport. He met one fellow American overseas:</p><blockquote><p>…as cultural outsiders we were each other’s best alternative for companionships. But once we returned home to our beloved American families and friends, thebasis for comparison switched back to “normal” mode. </p></blockquote><p>Would that foreign exchange student you dates in high school have been as “cool” or “exotic” had they been from Germantown, PA instead of Germany? Was that experience teaching overseas in Peace Corps really <em>that</em> cool or am I just assigning extra romanticism to it because I was an “outsider” in a foreign land?</p><h4>Takeaways</h4><p>We’re very smart, but we’re also very irrational as people. We’d like to think logic and rationality governs most of our lives but Ariely has a knack for showing us just how reliant we are upon split second and irrational comparisons to the available yet limited information we have around us. </p><p>Morally speaking, as a business owner or person you have a duty to make decisions now with this comparison fallability in mind. While yes, you can structure your products in a way to extract <em>more</em> profit than normal from your customers, you need to do this only when you truly feel like that high-end product you’re directing them to is actually giving them more value. </p><p>Personally, don’t find the most repulsive personality to take out on a double date hoping that it makes you look good. This might even back fire since your double date might end up <em>comparing you</em> to the company you hang out with and irrationally judge you just as repulsive. </p><p>Comparison is a force of nature that can’t always be controlled, but it can be guided. Ariely shows us how. </p><p>Bren</p><p>P.S. Here is a fun video by Dan at a Ted Talk</p></div></div></div>]]>

That taught me two things: <br></p><ul><li>I should spend less time reading my e-mails about macro.</li><li>Transformers are going to revolutionize the way we operate.</li></ul><p>The one issue with transformers is that they are fairly slow to inference. Even as the NLP community wraps its collective brain around <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3">GPT-3 writing dad-jokes</a>, one big caveat keeps on showing up: GPT-3 is <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/gpt-3-is-great-but-not-without-shortcomings/">slow</a>.

But <a href="https://medium.com/microsoftazure/accelerate-your-nlp-pipelines-using-hugging-face-transformers-and-onnx-runtime-2443578f4333"> this post</a> piqued my interest. Huge gains of performance can be gained from better inference libraries. However porting models to ONNX and allowing them to be ran using onnxruntime can be difficult.

<p>Over time, it was released on all major store fronts: Steam, GOG, HumbleStore and itch.io. We recently released console versions for Xbox, PS and Nintendo Switch, but that happened after the initial five years and will not be covered here.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h3>
<p>I’ll give you the grand yearly numbers right away. For NDA reasons I can’t go into specific details about how much we sold on each distribution platform, but will instead lump all our digital sales together. All of this units are gross value, that means before tax, distribution rev share and charge backs (usually around 5-15%).</p>


<p>As you can see Curious Expedition had its <strong>most successful years two full years after releasing the first version</strong>. If you’re interested in how we managed to do that just keep reading the detailed history below:</p>
<h2 id="year-1-2014---alpha">Year 1 (2014) - Alpha</h2>
<h3 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h3>
<p>Johannes and I met at Berlin AAA developer <a href="https://www.yager.de/" target="_blank">Yager</a> where we both worked on the war/anti-war game Spec Ops: The Line. We decided to start working on a hobby project around 2012, with the grand dream of potentially going indie with it. Curious Expedition (or Terra Incognita as it was called back then) was the first game that we both agreed on. The idea came to me when I browsed a National Geographic magazine in the waiting room of my dentist.</p>
<p>During this hobbyist phase we struggled quite a bit with the game. Our interest in the premise never waned, but we went through dozens of game mechanics without really being able to nail down the core loop concept. During that time we met multiple times with the intention of quitting the game, only to give it two more months over and over again. We made a leap of faith when we decided to quit our AAA jobs in the beginning of 2014.</p>
<p>The birth of our company Maschinen-Mensch (at some point we had called ourselves Hic Sunt Leones) was eased by a <strong>€50,000 grant from <a href="https://www.medienboard.de/" target="_blank">Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg</a></strong>. Thankfully we also had a bit of personal savings that helped us survive the initial months since the grant is only allowed to cover 50% of the project costs.</p>
<p>The first thing we did when finally started working full-time on the game, was completely ripping it apart and disabling all features until nothing but a simplistic movement prototype remained. From here we rebuilt all the aspects of the game. Our hope that we finally were onto something was kindled by the positive feedback from our small game designer meetup that we started around the same time.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014 we pushed ourselves to finally release the painfully barebone initial alpha of the game. Complete sections of the game were still missing: when you ran into combat a text message would tell you that we basically didn’t get to that part yet. But we had no choice: our money was running out at this point.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-editions">Alpha Editions</h3>
<p>We released the first buyable version of Curious Expedition on our own homepage where we sold it via the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/developer/widget" target="_blank">Humble Widget</a>. We took some inspiration from all the new Kickstarter projects that were created in 2014 and showed that players appreciated different pricing and feature options for purchasing games.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of all editions we started with:</p>

<h3 id="day-1-sales">Day 1 sales</h3>
<p>Our first release date was November 18th 2014 and we sold in total <em>drum rolls</em>.. <strong>61 copies for a total revenue of $1,203</strong>. Not exactly dream numbers when you just quit your high profile AAA job and spent all your savings on creating this indie game, which has to work out for you to be able to remain an indie game dev.</p>
<p>Here’s a break-down of the unit types sold on that first day:</p>
<div><h4>Launch Day (November 18th 2014)</h4></div>
<h3 id="back-to-work">Back to work</h3>
<p>After pushing the big frightening release button, I remember that we went to a coincidental drink out with some friends from the game dev scene. I still remember how they asked curiously how much we had already sold. I felt bad about telling them that this great indie game experiment we had launched had pretty much tanked at this point. But there was no point in giving up now, so on Monday we got back into the office (which was my living room) and just started working on our next big alpha update.</p>
<p>I turned my old iPad into a live sales metrics board showing the current sales in the style of an airport destinations board and we hooked up to a hefty cash register sound whenever somebody bought a copy of our game. I remember with joy the small moments of celebration when during work the sound would come up and how we high-fived. I also remember those stretches of hours when there was no single sound being played though and we were checking if our metrics were broken, before realizing once again that this was just the state of affairs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we sold in total <strong>793</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$10,965</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$13.83</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="year-2-2015---early-access">Year 2 (2015) - Early Access</h2>
<p>In 2015 we pushed hard on extending Curious Expedition 1. Despite the slow start we were nowhere done and set our hopes into appearing in digital storefronts. So far we had tried to bring people to our small website, but since the players didn’t come to the game, it was time to bring the game to the players.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-videos">Alpha Videos</h3>
<p>Up to this point we had mostly relied on twitter to attract players to our homepage. Today we’re close to 6,000 followers on twitter, but back then we were struggling for a long time to even get to 500 followers.</p>
<p>To build up visibility and hopefully share our excitement about our game, we started recording videos for the numerous alpha updates that we did. Looking at them now, they are a crazy trip down the memory lane to our past selves. Here’s the one for Alpha 4, which is special since it is the alpha in which we added combat for the first time.</p>

          <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0KRUAeg79E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
          </p>
          
<p>For each alpha update we announced the release day weeks in advance and approached it like a mini-release with marketing material and a strong theme for each of these updates. We made sure to have at least one highly visible “hero feature” per alpha release.</p>
<p>For this update our main focus were our dice challenges. We had been working on combat prototypes for over a year at this point, but as we added more and more combat features, we realized that it became a big centerpiece and we were over-scoping heavily, so we made the hard decision to completely remove combat and make a game that would work solely based on the merits of its unique travel gameplay first.</p>
<p>We did this even though we felt that we had stumbled into an interesting spin on combat: a 1-dimensional dungeon crawler, where instead of on a grid your character and the enemies would be laid out on a line.</p>
<h3 id="free-weekend">Free weekend!</h3>
<p>Before going to stores, we decided to try our luck on drawing more people to our website one last time and did a free weekend! Players could play the game right from their web browser without having to download anything. This was not only nice for lowering entry barriers but also made it very easy for us to revoke access to the game after the weekend was done.</p>
<p>We expected to have fewer sales during the free weekend with an uptick in sales afterwards from players who wanted to play more. To our surprise we had the highest sales during the time when the game was free. Afterwards the sales normalized pretty quickly again.</p>
<div><h4>Sales before and after the free weekend (Feb 2015)</h4></div>
<h3 id="storefront">Storefront!</h3>
<p>On May 19th we finally entered Early Access on Steam as our first store front and this is when Curious Expedition finally changed trajectory to become a success. We still sold the extra editions through our own homepage but the vast majority of sales now happened on the digital storefronts.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-strategy">Pricing Strategy</h3>
<p>We increased our price from <strong>$12</strong> to <strong>$15</strong> as we released the Early Access version. We felt it was fair enough since we had spent many months adding additional content to the game. The following chart shows the average price point per year.</p>
<div><h4>Average Price per Year (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>We also decided to be as timid as possible regarding sales. Until we reached the 1.0 phase we decided to not do any sales that went beyond 20%. You can see a timeline of our general sale price reductions here.</p>
<div><h4>On-Sale Reduction (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>In 2015 we sold in total <strong>21,266</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$302,534</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$14.23</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="year-3-2016---gold-release">Year 3 (2016) - Gold Release</h2>
<h3 id="going-gold">Going Gold</h3>
<p>This is the year that we released the 1.0 version of Curious Expedition after over a year of Early Access. We also landed in more online stores: getting a presence in the HumbleStore and being lucky enough to be chosen by GOG as one of the very few games that they chose for their Games in Production program.</p>
<p>We read that you only get one big push in your game’s lifetime: either your Kickstarter campaign or your early access release or your full release. Luckily for us this turned out to not be the case. Not only did the game keep selling well in 2016, the release of the 1.0 version even surpassed our sales records until that point and pushed the game to sell more units than it had in 2015. After the gold release we started applying more sales and going beyond 20%. We were still extremely conservative for a game that had been released for two years now.</p>

   <time>August 2020</time>

   

   

   <p>Piloting an <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/ocean-exploration-ship-60266">ocean exploration ship</a> or <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/mars-research-shuttle-60226">Martian research shuttle</a> is serious business. Let’s hope the control panel is up to scratch. Two studs wide and angled at 45°, the ubiquitous “2x2 decorated slope” is a LEGO minifigure’s interface to the world.</p>

<p>These iconic, low-resolution designs are the perfect tool to learn the basics of physical interface design. Armed with 52 different bricks, let’s see what they can teach us about the design, layout and organisation of complex interfaces.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of LEGO UX design.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/interfaces.jpg" alt="LEGO interfaces"></p>

<h2 id="organised-chaos">Organised chaos</h2>

<p>At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but it’s clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others. Most interfaces in our world contain a blend of digital screens and analog inputs like switches and dials. These LEGO panels are no different.</p>

<p>Plotting the panels across these two axes reveals a few different clusters. Screens with an accompanying row of buttons sit in the top left. A small cluster of very organised switch panels lies to the far right. The centre bottom is occupied by some wild concepts that are hard to understand, even after several glances.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Design positioning with LEGO, in LEGO</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Designing a complex machine interface is a juggling act of many different factors from ergonomics to engineering. But we can break down the problem into two key questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can we <em>differentiate</em> between the function of different inputs?</li>
  <li>How can we <em>organise</em> the many inputs and outputs so that we understand how they relate to each other?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a deeper look at tackling these two challenges in LEGO.</p>

<h2 id="differentiating-inputs">Differentiating inputs</h2>

<p>What could cause 400 WWII pilots to raise the landing gear on their B-17 bomber just before touchdown? Catastrophic pilot error, or something more fundamental?</p>

<p>It was the psychologist Alphonsis Chapanis who first suggested that the high rate of crash landings might be the fault of poor interface design. The adjacent landing gear and flap control knobs were identically shaped. The pilots never stood a chance.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/landing.jpg" alt="B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to irradiate the problem. Source: Wikipedia">
    <figcaption>B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to irradiate the problem. Source: Wikipedia</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>His temporary solution was to glue differently shaped strips of rubber to each switch, enabling blind operation by touch alone. This gave rise to the idea of shape coding and a system of differentiation still being followed in aircraft cockpits today.</p>

<p>We can compare the three interfaces below to see this in action. Ignore the overall layout, it’s the differences between individual switches that matter here. Imagine trying to feel for one of these buttons without looking. The left panel (“Slope 45 2 x 2 with 12 Buttons”) would require careful hand-eye co-ordination. The right panel (“Aircraft Multiple Flight Controls”) clearly distinguishes between the throttle (large, linear vertical movement), toggle switches (round vertical flick) and the push buttons (square push-in).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/differentiation.jpg" alt="Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation">
    <figcaption>Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Differentiation like this is a still a very real problem today. In 2015, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/01/06/autos/ford-push-button-ignition-recall/index.html">Ford recalled 13,500 Lincoln SUVs</a> because drivers speeding down the motorway were mistakenly shutting off the engine when they tried to activate sport mode. See if you can spot why:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Ford Lincoln MKC before the Engine start/stop button was moved. Source: CNN</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Shape coding is one approach to differentiation, but there are many others. Colour coding is perhaps the only one to break into our everyday vocabulary, but we can add four more: size, texture, position and operation coding. Together these six are our allies in the design of error-proof interfaces.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/codings.jpg" alt="The 6 basic codings. Notice that many of these examples actually combine multiple codings in one.">
    <figcaption>The 6 basic codings. Notice that many of these examples actually combine multiple codings in one.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Size, shape and colour-coding are the fundamentals: quick-wins that can fix a lot of interface problems. Texture is also a great differentiator for blind operation, particularly on small dials requiring precise control.</p>

<p>Position-coding is seemingly straightforward but is often under used. Products with a clear default ergonomic position (like binoculars or a gaming console) can exploit the natural position of the hand to differentiate between primary and secondary actions.</p>

<p>Finally, operation-coding ascribes different types of movements (like a twist or vertical slide) to different inputs. This can be immensely powerful when the switch motion reinforces the operation behind it, e.g. a crane lever which raises the crane when the lever is raised.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/lego-codings.jpg" alt="The six different codings in use in the LEGO interfaces: size, shape, colour, texture, position, operation">
    <figcaption>The six different codings in use in the LEGO interfaces: size, shape, colour, texture, position, operation</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Differentiation is a good first step that will avoid confusion between adjacent switches. But its only with organisation that we can create a clear and accurate mental model of the interface for the user.</p>

<h2 id="organising-inputs">Organising inputs</h2>

<p>Compare the three panels below. Identical layouts, but the blue one is much clearer than the white. This is the <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles">gestalt principles</a> at work, identifying related items with a common region.</p>

    <figcaption>Basic differentiation by clustering</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Easy. But how are you going to decide which inputs to cluster together?</p>

<p>I like to use <a href="http://blog.presentandcorrect.com/27986-2">Soviet control panels</a> as a starting point. These beautiful walls of nonsensical dials and levers are brought to life when arranged in a giant factory schematic.  It would be hard to find a more literal organisation of the information.</p>

    <figcaption>Soviet control panels in action. Source: Present and Correct</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>These panels are what I’d called a consolidated interface. Every piece of input and feedback has been moved onto the same panel. This is the approach that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/33847/the-defunct-dyson-evs-steering-wheel-looks-like-it-was-made-by-vacuum-cleaner-people">Dyson took with their car</a>. Now imagine the opposite, moving each of those lights and switches to the actual location of that valve in the factory. Sounds ludicrous, but these <a href="https://deeptread.com/blog/2016/11/21/audi-tt-air-vent-design">air vents in the Audi TT</a> show that this distributed approach can also be a great win for user experience. I wrote a lot more about these <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2018/Interfaces/">distributed interfaces last year</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/distributed.jpg" alt="Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)">
    <figcaption>Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Back to the Soviet factories. Those interface panels were great for answering the question “does this valve let water into tank Б?”. But they’re very poor for answering “are all water valves closed?” or “where are all the switches I need to prepare for the shift changeover?”.</p>

<p>LEGO use the Soviet schematic approach for their <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298pb005&amp;in=S">fantasy</a> <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298px10&amp;in=S">orientated</a> designs, because schematics are superb at providing a mental model of the inner workings of an alien system. However for everyday use, there are some other approaches that work better.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>LEGO Insectoid and UFO interfaces. I wonder what these buttons actually do?</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p><strong>Feature</strong> based organisation is the most common, perhaps even the “default” design philosophy. Group together all the inputs and outputs for each product feature. This <a href="https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/press-releases/building-life-saving-ventilator-lightning-speed">COVID-19 ventilator from Cambridge Consultants</a> is a wonderful example but we also see this a lot in cars, with a cluster of switches for the airflow control and all of the lights on one control stick.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/covid-ventilator.jpg" alt="COVID-19 ventilator by Cambridge Consultants with clear feature-based organisation. Source: Cambridge Consultants">
    <figcaption>COVID-19 ventilator by Cambridge Consultants with clear feature-based organisation. Source: Cambridge Consultants</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Organising by <strong>operation</strong> means putting all the switches that function in a certain way in the same place. I’ve no idea what all the valves in the picture below do, but I bet they don’t all open things that relate to each other. Anytime you see a row of switches that look and function the same, but control disparate parts of the system, you’ve come across organisation by operation.</p>

<figure>

  </figure>

<p>Today most interfaces are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a>, but historically the levers that you pulled in, say, a tractor cabin would literally move the hydraulic pistons beneath the seat to a new position. Routing all these different electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems efficiently can severely compromise your interface clustering, leading to organisation by <strong>technology</strong>.</p>

<p>The modern equivalent of this is surprisingly common. Any touchscreen with buttons by the side exhibits this technology-based split. In a <a href="https://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/PneumaticDisplays">future</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/343640141">world</a>, SpaceX might embed <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-touchscreen-astronaut-thoughts.html">these physical controls</a> right inside the screen next to the information they affect, but for now they sit awkwardly by the side as if nothing is wrong.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/spacex-dragon.jpg" alt="Bob and Doug in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Source: SpaceX">
    <figcaption>Bob and Doug in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Source: SpaceX</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>In LEGO we find the feature based organisation in the “Monitor with -19° pattern”. Two clear clusters, perhaps one for temperature control and another for vital signs monitoring. In the second panel below, I don’t know what all those switches do, but they seem to be clustered based on their operation, not because of what they will operate.</p>

<p>There are many LEGO panels with a technology split like the SpaceX Dragon capsule, but I like to imagine that this early 90s police control unit was forced to divide the audio and video playback because the newer tape reel technology was incompatible with the older analog phone line system. This is organisation by technology in action.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/organisation.jpg" alt="L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case">
    <figcaption>L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>All of our approaches so far: organisation by features, operation or technology, have been grounded in properties of the system, not of the user. Organisation by <strong>use-case</strong> is the antidote to this, a clustering based on the daily routines and tasks of the user.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving for work each day at the LEGO body scanner factory. Grouping the switches by task (prepare machine, load body, process scan…) would mean splitting up the radiation and scanner buttons into many different regions. More complex for the computer, but more streamlined for the operator. As the designer, only you and your users will be the judge of what works best.</p>

            The rule cursor and central slide can be positioned using a mouse. Fine adjustment can be achieved using the keyboard left and right arrow buttons.
            The keyboard keys move the cursor or slide depending upon which had last been clicked or adjusted.

        <p>
            The left hand display below the rule (“A on B” etc) shows the slide position. The central display shows the cursor position over each of the slide scales.

        <h3>The Calculator</h3>
        <p>
            You can try using the virtual calculator just like a normal one although the choice of functions and the absence of plus and minus buttons might be a 
            little eccentric. Please remember though that calculations performed on a slide rule will not always be as accurate as those performed on an electronic 
            calculator. Results can and will differ.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can enter values using the “buttons” or from your keyboard (including the numeric keypad if “Num Lock” is set. The sum is executed by the virtual 
            slide rule and the result read back from the slide rule. The division function is executed in two stages with a 1.5 second delay between them. 
            An experienced slide rule user would probably skip the second stage as the result can be read from the end of the slider.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can calculate the tangent of angles (in degrees) between 6° and 84°. The S (sine) scale is also used to calculate cosines – both in the range 1° to 90°.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            I was looking through some bits and bobs that came from a draw in my Father’s house when it was being cleared for sale.
            One of the items was a slide rule and it was found alongside the early “Sinclair Executive” calculator that replaced it.
            It is small (nominally 6" probably) and pretty similar to the one I remember buying with my first student grant money in
            the very late 1960s when they were still pretty much the state of the art for calculators. Around that time though, I did
            come into contact with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumlock_ANITA_calculator" target="_blank">electronic Anita calculator</a> but they were staggeringly expensive and you could hardly slip one
            in your pocket or even carry one very far.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sinclair Executive calculator came out in 1972 and cost £79.95 (over £1000 in 2020 money) and I probably paid £5 or £6 for the
            slide rule three or four years before that (still an appreciable cost that needed some internal debate to justify).
        </p>
        <p>
            The slide rule was invented sometime between 1620 and 1630 with new functions developed and added over time until the device became the tool
            of choice for the developing field of engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            How do they work? It is pretty easy to see how two rulers could be used to do simple addition and subtraction. We can try adding 3 and 8.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://adit.co.uk/Images/add3to8.png"></p><p>
            We position the start on the lower ruler’s scale at one of the two values (in this case 3) and read off the sum of 3 and 8 on the scale of the upper ruler (see the red line).
            It should also be obvious that the same positioning could be used to calculate 11 minus 8 or any other pair of values on the two ruler scales.
        </p>
        <div><p>
            Now such a simple mechanical device for adding two numbers together would not be terribly useful even if they were decimal fractions such as 3.4 and 8.7
            which would be easy to do with the rulers shown above. However being able to multiply (say) 1.65 by 3.45 would be more challenging mental arithmetic for most.
            When I was at school, we used logarithms for such calculations.
            </p><p>
            The logarithm (base 10) of a number is the number expressed as a power of 10.
            </p><p>
            1.65 = 10<sup>0.2175</sup>  so log(1.65) = 0.2175
            <br>
            3.45 = 10<sup>0.5378</sup> so log(3.45) = 0.5378
            <br>
            0.5378 + 0.2175 = 0.7553 (sum the logs)
            <br>
            10<sup>0.7553</sup> = 5.6925 which is the product of 1.65 and 3.45.
            </p><p>
            Thus simple addition can be used to multiply two decimal fractions expressed as logarithms.
        </p></div>
        <p>
            Fortunately, when I was at school, we did not need to calculate these powers of 10 – we were issued with books of tables for looking them up. 
            The tables included a host of trigonometric tables as well as the vital “antilogarithms” needed to establish that 10<sup>0.7553</sup> was 5.69 
            (which was about as accurate as the ones I had could get.
        </p>
        <p>
            If instead of having pages of tables we were to draw a logarithmic scale on a pair or rulers instead of the linear scale illustrated above we could 
            use them to multiply two values by adding the logs. Indeed we could also do division by subtracting one logarithmic scale position from another. 
            So, what does a logarithmic scale look like in action?
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://adit.co.uk/Images/logRules.png"></p><p>
            You will notice that as the values increase (from 1 to 10 in this instance) the distance between the log of those values decreases. 
            You can probably also see that two rules with logarithmic scales can be used to make our calculation (1.65 x 3.45). Slide rules were fast and accurate enough for most purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why does the log scale start at 1? Well ten to the power of zero is 1 and zero is a good place to start. In fact any number to the power of zero is 1.
        </p>

                <p>At one time, it certainly was easier to keep tabs on in-house team productivity. That’s no longer the case with today’s team collaboration software. Automated software development analytics programs like <a href="https://gitential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitential</a> and<a href="https://waydev.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Waydev</a> put remote developers on equal footing with in-house software development teams. They track all interactions with git repositories and produce a variety of performance metrics. This brings complete transparency to team member productivity.&nbsp; A shortlist of metrics includes code churn, code efficiency, code volume, coding hours, number of commits, and test volume.</p>
<p>Do you need actual “eyes-on” what everyone is doing?<a href="https://www.sococo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sococo</a> provides a virtual office solution for Agile Teams. Whether in-house or distributed, all team members have a room in your “virtual building.” At a glance, you can see who’s online and what they’re working on, in real-time. It provides broadcasting capabilities, teleconferences, screen-sharing for presentations, and more. The only downside is that it requires everyone to use a headset.</p>

                <p>We can break this myth. Some offices are idealistic and serene. Some home offices may resemble mosh pits. A<a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-2018-annual-survey-workers-believe-flexible-remote-job-can-help-save-money-reduce-stress-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2018 FlexJobs Survey</a> of 3,000 participants indicated 75% are more productive working remotely. They cited coworker interruptions and general office noises as major issues. Less commuting and reduced office politics were also cited as boosting productivity. The<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/remote-work-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ultimate List of Remote Work Statistics</a> – 2020 Edition shows similar studies from Owl Labs, Buffer, Gallup, and others. They consistently reflect higher productivity and quality of work in telecommuting environments.</p>
<p>Veteran remote developers know two things are vital. The first is to remove distractions from one’s work area. The second is the discipline to not give in to temptations. Managers can coach team members they believe are challenged by their work remote environment. In-house teams may find the adjustment difficult at first. For outsourced teams, <i>it is their SOP</i> and they likely have productivity tips to share.</p>

                <p>Some managers believe that you lose control of your project without an in-house team. That can happen if you forget two important legal agreements. The first is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).&nbsp; It enforces that team members understand you own and control all intellectual property. That goes for any work product or inventions associated with any contract.</p>
<p>The second is a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This specifies the services an agency or individual will provide to you. It specifies the expected standards and metrics whereby the work will be measured. It lays out each party’s responsibilities. Additionally, it defines the remedies and penalties for any breach. Violations of SLA’s and NDA’s are subject to civil suits and monetary damages.</p>
<p>In all cases, as the contractor, you are free to specify who your project manager will be. You decide what methodologies and processes your teams will follow. You select the team collaboration software, and reporting mechanisms everyone will use.</p>

                <p>The cost-advantage of remote or dedicated development teams is substantial even if only compared to office costs. The average office space per employee in North America runs 150 square feet or $6,000 (Chicago) to $12,000 per year (San Francisco). Other employee-based overhead costs sidestepped by remote teams. These include taxes, employee benefits and insurance, computer hardware, software, and consumable supplies.</p>

                <p>Recruiter and hiring managers aren’t complaining about a lack of job applications. Their gripes concern a lack of qualified applicants. In 2019, the United States had about 4.2 million software developers. In contrast, there are roughly 5.5 million developers in Europe and 24 million worldwide. In-house software development teams rely upon limited local talent. You can attract more qualified developers by outsourcing through IT staffing agencies.</p>
<p>While the United States does have good programmers, they don’t stack up against the Top 10 very well. According to<a href="https://skillvalue.com/companies/en/it-ranking-best-developers-2019-skillvalue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Where to Find the Best Developers in 2019?</a> by SkillValue, the United States ranks a distant #27. US developers had scored 84.59% as rated against over 550 technical assessments.</p>
<p>In comparison, a wide swath of Eastern Europe scored in the 93% range. Ukraine, for example, ranked #5 with a score of 93.17%. But don’t forget to factor in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and Cost of Living. Add these and you’ll find that Ukraine’s ~250,000 developers offer the best combination of value and technical proficiency available.</p>

        <p>Regardless of the scientific discipline you are working in, you probably
write some code to perform your experiments. This post aims to inform
you about the need for adding a <em>licence</em> to your software—a procedure
that is often neglected, in particular since it is associated with legal
considerations, which are perceived as being tedious by many<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Since
I am not a lawyer, I will go easy on the legalese and just provide
a quick overview.</p>
<p>(If you are in a hurry, feel free to <a href="#parting-thoughts">skip to the conclusion and its actionable items</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: your university might require you to consult with
them <em>prior</em> to releasing software into the wild. Make sure to check
whether you are actually allowed to release your code without anyone
checking out the legalities of the situation. This article is mostly
written from a machine learning perspective, where people tend to be
very generous in releasing their code, but often forget to choose an
appropriate licence.</p>

<p>Software licences serve multiple purposes. Most importantly, they specify
what kind of interactions you want people to have with your code. For
example, are you okay with your code—and thus potentially your
name—being used to <em>advertise</em> a product or service of someone else? Are
you okay with people using the software <em>commercially</em>? What happens if
your code does not work as expected and produces <em>incorrect results</em>?</p>
<p>A licence helps you cover all of these aspects—and many more. But the
primary function of a licence is not necessarily to <em>protect</em> you from bad
things, it also defines what kind of community you want to build around your
code. For example, how do you handle improvements of your code? How do
you want to be attributed? How do you want <em>others</em> to be attributed?
Can <em>anyone</em> contribute to your project?</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: A software licence clearly defines what people <em>can</em> and
<em>cannot</em> do with your code. It helps you, your users, and your
potential contributors.</p>

<p>You might think that, being the generous scientist that you are, that
your code should be released with essentially a ‘no strings attached’
policy. That is commendable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but the law, for once, is <em>not</em> on your
side here: if you release code <em>without</em> a licence attached, the default
interpretation in most—if not all—jurisdictions is that you retain
all privileges. This might sound not too bad, but there are often
unintended  consequences. For example,
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/no-permission">choosealicense.com</a> has the
following things to say about having <em>no</em> licence&nbsp;(emphasis by me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under
<em>exclusive copyright</em> by default. Unless you include a license that
specifies otherwise, <em>nobody else</em> can copy, distribute, or modify your
work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.
<strong>Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody”
starts including you</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is bad! Suppose that you revisit a project that you collaborated on
with multiple people. After a few years, you have the urge to make this
into a commercial tool. If you have no licence, you technically have to
negotiate with all of your original contributors, or even your previous
employers&nbsp;(remember that you might change university affiliations a few
times). If you fail to do this, you make your life harder and, in the
worst case, you may be subject to litigation.</p>
<p>However, you are not only impeding <em>your</em> future possibilities if you do
not specify a licence, you are also hurting the options of <em>others</em>:
code without a licence can be removed without a whim, and technically,
everyone who builds on that code has to ask for permission and is not
directly allowed to redistribute it. Again, as a worst-case scenario,
you might have to <em>retract</em> code because you never had the right to use
it in the first place! Plus, companies tend to avoid code without
a licence like a plague because <em>they</em> have legal departments that know
about the dire consequences of using code without the proper legal
framework<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: If you do not use a licence, you are only hurting
yourself&nbsp;(or your future self) and the prospects of your project.</p>

<p>After all these warnings about unintended consequences, it is time for
some good news: in this age, adding a licence to your code is as easy as
it gets. Here are the main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to <em>pick</em> an appropriate licence—no worries, we
will talk about this in a second!</li>
<li>You now create a file called <code>LICENSE</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in your main code
repository and add your name to it.</li>
<li>Optionally, you now add a text of the form ‘See <code>LICENSE</code> for details
on how to use this code’ to your source code files. This is just
a courtesy for your users; your selected licence still applies to all
source files, but sometimes, adding such a disclaimer is a good
reminder—in particular for large code bases.</li>
<li>You publish the code. That’s it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds easy, right? In fact, it is so easy that <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> even provides
licence templates when setting up a repository. It does not even take
a few minutes of your time—which is how it should be!</p>

<p>Now that you know how easy it is, which licence should you choose?  For
this, the website <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosealicense.com</a> is
a treasure trove. Moreover, the website <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/">tldrlegal.com</a>
is also great in explaining the specifics of a licence in plain English.
Please do not take my word for it and check all the licences I will
subsequently mention!</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: At this point, I have to stress that what comes next
is my personal opinion and it is thus heavily biased towards a certain
type of licence.  I will try to back up my claims, though!</p>
<h2 id="avoid-copyleft-licences">Avoid copyleft licences</h2>
<p>As a first piece of advice, I would urge you to <em>avoid</em> so-called
copyleft licences, like the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)">GNU General Public Licence v3</a>.
I know that this is a controversial statement for some, but before you
close this tab in anger, let me explain: a copyleft licence forces your
users to require all derivative works—other projects, updates, and
extensions of your code—to be released under the <em>same</em> licence as
your original code. This sounds fair at first glance—after all, you
made your code available for anyone else to be free to use, so others
should do the same, right? While I agree with this sentiment, the
GPL&nbsp;(and similar licences) make it harder for private companies to
engage with your project. There are subtle legal issues that often
require for-profit businesses <em>not</em> to engage with code like this, even
if they wanted to!</p>
<p>Note that I am not claiming that there are no successful industry
contributions to GPL projects! I am merely pointing out that this
licence raises the bar quite considerably for other institutions to
engage with your code. Especially when you develop tools for others to
be used, as is very common in bioinformatics and machine learning, you
want to make it easy for others to build on your work. Do not take my
word for it, though: if you are
not convinced, read <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-on-licensing-in-bioinformatics.html">this article on licencing software in bioinformatics</a>
by <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">C. Titus Brown</a>,
as well as <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/i-was-wrong-part-2">this article on the troubles with licencing</a>, written
by <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/biography.html">Lior Pachter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Avoid copyleft licences if you can&nbsp;(but they are still
a lot better than having no licence at all).</p>
<p><strong>Philosophical sidenote</strong>&nbsp;(you may skip this): it is one of my
core tenets that I do not want to <em>force</em> people into a certain kind of
desirable behaviour—such as sharing their code—but rather I want to
<em>convince</em> them. The formulation of copyleft appears to be too
stringent for my taste: I can easily imagine situations in which abiding
by this licence is problematic for the other party, even if they <em>want</em>
to abide by it! Thus, I am not a big proponent of these licences any
more. When I originally got involved with Linux, BSD, and the open
source movement, I liked the GPL a lot, but as I started using BSD more
and more, my stance changed.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-permissive-licence-instead">Use a permissive licence instead</h2>
<p>So, what licence <em>should</em> you choose for your academic code, then?
I prefer the so-called <em>permissive</em> licences, which are often also
referred to as ‘BSD-style’ licences. Permissive licences have minimal
restrictions as to how your software can be used, but they provide
protection for you <em>and</em> make it possible for others to attribute your
work! Here is my preferred permissive licence, the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)">Revised BSD 3-Clause
Licence</a>:</p>

<p>United Airlines today announced it plans to resume service on nearly 30 international routes in September, including flights to Asia, India, Australia, Israel and Latin America and to continue to add ways to visit popular vacation destinations in the Caribbean, Hawaii and Mexico. The <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/klm-to-lay-off-5000-employees-due-to-covid-19-crisis/">airline</a> intends to fly 37% of its overall schedule in September as compared to the same period last year and is a 4% increase in capacity compared to what is planned for August 2020. United is also extending its waiver of change fees and award redeposit fees for reservations through August 31.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We continue to be realistic in our approach to building back our international and domestic schedules by closely monitoring customer demand and flying where people want to go,” said Patrick Quayle, United’s vice president of International Network and Alliances. “In September, we’re adding even more options for leisure travelers or those who want to visit friends and relatives, whether that’s within the United States or around the world.”&nbsp;</p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 





<p>Domestically, United intends to fly 40% of its schedule. The airline plans to add more than 40 daily flights on 48 routes to locations including Austin, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Santa Barbara, California. Additionally, United plans to resume service between the U.S. mainland and Hilo and Kauai and increase flying to Honolulu, Kona and Maui in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>



<p>Internationally, <a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-07-31-united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september-2646851493.html" target="_blank" aria-label="United  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">United </a>intends to fly 30% of its schedule as compared to September 2019, which is a 5-point increase compared to August. The airline expects to resume service on 20 routes in Latin America and the Caribbean, including to popular vacation destinations like Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta in Mexico and to San Jose and Liberia in Costa Rica. United intends to begin new nonstop service between Chicago and Tel Aviv and resume eight routes in the Atlantic and Pacific, including the return of European service from Houston with flights to Amsterdam and Frankfurt.</p>



<p><strong>U.S. Domestic&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Travelers in search of more socially distant vacation options like beach, mountain and national park destinations will continue to see opportunities for leisure travel including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Increasing opportunities to connect to more than 800 flights from United’s mid-continental hubs in Chicago, Denver and Houston.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding more than 40 daily flights on more than 48 routes across the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>Resuming service between the U.S. mainland and Hilo and Kauai in Hawaii&nbsp;</li><li>Increasing service between the U.S. mainland and Honolulu, Kona and Maui.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Atlantic</strong></p>



<p>Internationally, United is scheduled to fly 30% of its schedule in September compared to the same period in 2019. Across the Atlantic, United plans to offer customers more opportunities to get to Europe and beyond from Chicago, Houston, New York/Newark, and San Francisco. Highlights include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Launching brand-new service between Chicago and Tel Aviv&nbsp;<em>(subject to government approval)</em></li><li>Resuming service between Chicago and Amsterdam.&nbsp;</li><li>Resuming service between Houston and Amsterdam and Frankfurt.&nbsp;</li><li>Resuming service between San Francisco and Munich.&nbsp;</li><li>Increasing to daily service between Chicago and Frankfurt, and between San Francisco and London.&nbsp;</li><li>Continuing service between the United States and Delhi and Mumbai&nbsp;<em>(subject to government approval)</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pacific</strong></p>



<p>Across the Pacific in September, United plans to re-start three-times-weekly service between Los Angeles and Sydney and passenger service between Chicago and Hong Kong&nbsp;<em>(subject to government approval).</em></p>

<p><strong>KLM is in the throes of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus at the start of 2020, numerous measures have already been taken to deal with the current circumstances. Expectations are that the road to recovery will be long and fraught with uncertainty. This means that KLM’s structure and size must be rigorously adjusted even further in the years ahead. Consequently, a total of 4,500 to 5,000 positions in the entire KLM Group (expressed in FTEs) will cease to exist.</strong></p>



<p>In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, KLM gradually began reducing the size of its network in February to operate less than 10% of its original number of <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september/">flights</a> by the start of April. In the second quarter, only 15% of the original number of flights were operated. In July, 30% of the original flights were operated and load factors are lagging behind. As a result, while the network is again being gradually and carefully expanded, revenues are lagging far behind.</p>

<p>Prospects for the airline industry – and KLM in particular – are uncertain. Different countries are now beginning to tighten their more relaxed travel restrictions. This is making customers more cautious when it comes to booking a ticket. In all scenarios, demand is only expected to recover by 2023 or 2024 at the earliest. The degree and speed of recovery will depend on a number of factors including the development of the virus, economic recovery and customer travel behaviour.</p>



<h2>KLM Adjusting to the New Reality</h2>



<p>Government support in the form of a direct state loan and guaranteed bank credit facilities amounting to a maximum of €3.4 billion will enable KLM to navigate the crisis in the forthcoming period. <a href="https://news.klm.com/klm-adapts-organisation-further-due-to-covid-19-crisis/" target="_blank" aria-label="KLM (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KLM</a> is extremely grateful for this support provided by means of the loan. In order to guarantee KLM’s existence in the longer term, the airline must adapt its size to the new reality. KLM therefore finds itself compelled to reduce its workforce down to the number needed for the planned operation in 2021/2022. Of the current total of 33,000 FTEs in the entire KLM Group, the workforce must be reduced by 4,500 to 5,000 FTEs to 28,000 FTEs in the course of 2021.</p>



<p>KLM’s size is already becoming smaller – and will continue to be reduced – based on the current measures, which include the non-renewal of temporary contracts (1,500 FTEs) and the Voluntarily Departure Scheme (2,000 FTEs). Additionally, natural attrition (500 FTEs) through retirement and the like in 2020 and 2021 will also contribute to the reduction needed.</p>



<p>Hence, despite the measures already taken, even fewer people will be needed at KLM in the years ahead. Additionally, for positions on the ground we also need to deal with some mismatch in functional skills and capabilities.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for this reason and taking into account the mismatch, alternative solutions will have to be found for ca. 1,500 positions. This relates to up to 500 ground positions, 300 cabin crew positions and 300 cockpit positions and approximately 400 positions at KLM subsidiaries and Air France-KLM group functions.</p>



<p>Given the high level of uncertainty, KLM keeps open the possibility of further reductions in case the production levels will be revised further down for 2021/2022 than the -20% planned now.</p>

<h3>KLM to Cooperate with Trade unions and Works Council</h3>



<p>KLM’s reorganisation plans tie in with organisation-wide changes at Air France KLM. In the forthcoming period, KLM will be cooperating closely with the trade unions to draft a social plan for each collective labour agreement domain and subsidiary, as well as maintaining close consultation with the Works Council about further defining the reorganisation. This will include a more detailed specification of the conditions set by the Dutch government on issuing the financing package. Expectations are that this will be finished in its entirety in the course of October.“</p>



<blockquote><p><em>A great deal has already been done in recent months with respect to adjusting the size of our company in the face of a new reality. Unfortunately, more measures are needed in the short term to guarantee KLM’s continued existence in the future. For this reason, we are elaborating the reorganisation plan to emerge from this crisis in a stronger position, while retaining as many jobs as we can in a responsible manner and repaying the loans as quickly as possible.</em></p><p><em>KLM employees are loyal, professional and hard working. They are always ready to serve our customers, one another, the company and society at large. Recent developments have again served to prove that this is true. It is incredibly difficult and sad for KLM to now have to bid farewell to valuable, committed colleagues. Certainly in view of how much we have succeeded in achieving together in recent years. The forthcoming period will be devoted to saying goodbye to colleagues who have to leave with due care and to reconstructing KLM.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I’m in the second week of the three week  virtual <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/2020-workshop-information/">MIT STAMP workshop</a>. Today, Prof. Nancy Leveson gave a talk titled <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Safety-Assurance.pdf">Safety Assurance (Safety Case): Is it Possible? Feasible?</a> Safety assurance refers to the act of assuring that a system is safe, after the design has been completed.</p>



<p>Leveson is a skeptic of evaluating the safety of a system. Instead, she argues for focusing on generating safety requirements at the design stage so that safety can be designed in, rather than doing an evaluation post-design.  (You can read her <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/White-Paper-on-Safety-Assurance.pdf">white paper</a> for more details on her perspective). Here are the last three bullets from her final slide:</p>



<ul><li><em>If you are using hazard analysis to prove your system is safe, then you are using it wrong and your goal is futile</em></li><li><em>Hazard analysis (using any method) can only help you find problems, it cannot prove that no problems exist</em></li><li><em>The general problem is in setting the right psychological goal. It should not be “confirmation,” but exploration</em></li></ul>



<p>This perspective resonated with me, because it matches how I think about availability metrics. You can’t use availability metrics to inform you about whether your system is reliable enough, because they can only tell you if you have a problem. If your availability metrics look good, that doesn’t tell you anything about how to spend your engineering resources on reliability.</p>



<p>As Leveson remarked about safety, I think the best we can do in our non-safety-critical domains is study our systems to identify where the potential problems are, so that we can address them. Since we can’t actually quantify risk, the best we can do is to get better at identifying systemic issues. We need to <em>always</em> be looking for problems in the system, regardless of how many nines of availability we achieved last quarter.  After all, that next major outage is always just around the corner. </p>

<p>A year ago I started working on a set of projects that requires accessing data from a huge legacy database. There was a decision to use <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper">Dapper</a> to facilitate database access code. For those of you who are not familiar with Dapper, it’s a set of extension methods to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.idbconnection?view=netcore-3.1">IDbConnection</a>, which allows to easily map C# object to SQL query parameters, as well as SQL query result to C# objects. I was quite skeptical to use a library that requires writing <code>SQL queries</code> directly in the C# code, because I got used to relying always on ORMs (<code>NHibernate</code> in particular). Throughout the year, <code>Dapper</code> has proven to be the right tool for the job. In the meantime, I also discovered a couple of features and tricks that allow me to write quite concise and easy to maintain database access code, and I think it’s worth sharing them here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always define aliases in SQL queries using <code>nameof()</code> operator</li>
<li>Use C# consts and enums in SQL queries instead of magic numbers</li>
<li>Use <code>FOR JSON PATH</code> to simplify fetching complex objects from database</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="resilient-to-refactoring">Resilient to refactoring<a href="#resilient-to-refactoring" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>Dapper allows to easily map SQL query results to C# objects based on the naming convention. There’s no problem if the database table columns’ names match object fields’ name - if there’s a discrepancy, you can deal with it by adding aliases:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    UserID AS [Id], 
    UserName AS [Name]
FROM 
    Users
</code></pre>

<p>However, the naming convention approach is fragile to rename refactoring. Changing the object field’s name will break your code and it can be hard to detect without an appropriate test suite. Fortunately, there’s a way to shorten this feedback loop and solve this issue in the design time. We can make our code more resilient by defining aliases using <code>string interpolation</code> and <code>nameof()</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>private static readonly string GetUsersListQuery = @$"
SELECT 
    UserID AS [{nameof(UserDBO.Id)}], 
    UserName AS [{nameof(UserDBO.Name)}]
FROM 
    Users
"
</code></pre>

<p>This not only takes away the threat of breaking the code while renaming <code>DBO</code> fields but also gives better discoverability and navigability in the code. Using <code>find usage</code> option, we can also find where a given field is used in the SQL queries. And there’s no performance penalty because the compiler can evaluate this string interpolation during the compilation, because all of the parameters are const. You can verify it by yourself with this <a href="https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgZgpghgLgrgJwgZwLQAdYwggdsgZgB8ABAJgEYBYAKHIAIBVZHAEQCEB5Wgb1voH0SBegEtcMegEkAJvR70A5hBgBueizX0Avv0HCxE+gDkoAWwjylK9ZvW6aD2gYYAlCOgD2yUTE8IAT3k9enQEUQA3WEsSCgA2eiQoGU9cABsg2IAGegBxFWYcZAAZUWQYAEU4HCCAXiESABIAIloAZQBRYo6AYQAVehCmFgQpVnoAQTb6AG0eXHMITzAACkKEDk4AOlkASm0AXQAaQZpBYZxTC0npuYWLZbWRza2riH2D2gAxV04AWVO53WyFozVUtG0QA">Sharplab.io example</a></p>

<p>But what if we want to get the result of the string interpolation without the need to run the whole program in debug mode? This is often needed when there’s a bug in the query and we want to copy it and test in the <code>Management Studio</code>. This can be easily archived with <code>Immediate window</code> - yes, that’s right, you can use <code>Immediate window</code> to evaluate the code in the design time. To evaluate the string, just enter fully qualified field name that holds the query into the <code>Immediate window</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/dapper-tips-and-tricks/evaluated_string_interpolation.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the output is not well-formatted and contains additional characters for line endings. We can fix it by adding <code>nq</code> (no quote) suffix:</p>

<p><img src="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/dapper-tips-and-tricks/evaluated_string_interpolation_with_nq.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you are using <code>Resharper</code> then you can avoid typing long <code>FQN</code> and copy it with a special option for this purpose:</p>

<p><img src="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/dapper-tips-and-tricks/resharper_copy_FQN.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="no-magic-numbers">No magic numbers<a href="#no-magic-numbers" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>Sometimes there is a need to use some sort of constant values in the SQL query (especially in the conditions). Queries with those cryptic values are very hard to review or even can cause a problem with understanding for the author himself after a while:</p>

<pre><code>public class Repository {
   private static readonly string GetActiveUsersListQuery = @$"
SELECT 
    UserID, 
    UserName
FROM 
    Users
WHERE
    UserType = 135
";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a classical example of well known code smell called <code>magic numbers</code>. We can solve this problem again with string interpolation. <strong>It’s tempting to introduce an enum that represents a set of available values but unfortunately using an enum as a parameter for the interpolated string will prevent the compiler from evaluating expression during the compilation. The evaluation will occur in the runtime and will result in creating a new string in the memory whenever the code is executed.</strong> This can hurt the application performance especially when you define SQL queries as local variables. You can check it on this <a href="https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgZgpghgLgrgJwgZwLQAdYwggdsgZgB8ABAJgEYBYAKHIAIBVZHAEQCEB5Wgb1voH0SBegEtcMegEkAJvR70A5hBgBueizX0Avv0HCxE+gDkoAWwjylK9ZvW6ag+rQe0IuOGaYsEAFQCe6BC8egIAggDGMKIAbpYAvPQUBACsADSh0rhQUbEJSQQAbC60tAYMAEoQ6AD2yKIwNQj+8qHoCLGwliQUhfRIUDI1uAA2LT0ADPQA4irMOMgAMqLIMACKcDgtiSQkACQARLQAygCii6cAwr7OjoLzCFKsabdOD6YWtABiFZwAsq97j5kLQAOoACVOFVOmQeASC9ESPDhgQgADpItE4g4DqoXEA">Sharplab.io example</a> If you need to keep strings with SQL queries as local variables then it’s better to define those magic values as const:</p>

<pre><code>public class Repository {
    
    static class UserType
    {
        public const string Active = "135";
        public const string Inactive = "136";
    }
    
   private static readonly string GetActiveUsersListQuery = @$"
SELECT 
    UserID, 
    UserName
FROM 
    Users
WHERE
    UserType = {UserType.Active}
";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Those constants must be a string type even if they are numeric values, otherwise the compiler generates invocation of <code>System.String.Format()</code> instead of creating a single string.</p>

<h2 id="bridge-the-gap-between-relational-and-object-oriented-models">Bridge the gap between relational and object-oriented models<a href="#bridge-the-gap-between-relational-and-object-oriented-models" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>Very often posts advertising micro ORMs present fairly simple examples where database data structures match almost 1-1 the C# structures. However, the reality is quite different and the discrepancy between relational and object-oriented model might be expensive and result with a large amount of code responsible for fetching and transforming data.</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public int Id {get; set;}
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public Address MainAddress { get; set; }
}

public class Address
{
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string FlatNo { get; set; }
    public string BuildingNo { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to fetch complete user data we can use one of the following approaches:</p>

<p>We can introduce some sort of intermediate type for fetching a result of the SQL query and then map it to the destination type in the memory. I call those intermediate types <code>DBO - DataBase Object</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserDBO
{
    public int Id {get; set;}
    public string FirstName { get;  }
    public string LastName { get; private set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string FlatNo { get; set; }
    public string BuildingNo { get; set; }
}

public class UserRepository
{
    static readonly string GetAllUserDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching user basic data*/
    
    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetUser(IDbConnection connection, int id)
    {
        var userDBO = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;UserDBO&gt;(GetAllUserDataSqlQuery, new {UserId = id});
        if(userDBO == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        return new User
        {
            Id = userDBO.Id,
            FirstName = userDBO.FirstName,
            LastName = userDBO.LastName,
            //TODO: If the address is optional then we should check if all attributes are not empty before creating an instance of Address
            MainAddress = new Address
            {
                City = userDBO.City,
                ZipCode = userDBO.ZipCode,
                Street = userDBO.Street,
                FlatNo = userDBO.FlatNo,
                BuildingNo = userDBO.BuildingNo
            }
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This solution has several disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>It requires an intermediate DBO type.</li>
<li>It requires additional mapping code to adjust fetched data to the desired structure</li>
<li>If we change the relation between User and Address from one-to-one to one-to-many, it will result in data duplication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another option is to fetch direct attributes (Id, FirstName, LastName) with one query, fetch address data with another one and merge user with address in memory:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserRepository
{
    static readonly string GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching user basic data*/
    static readonly string GetAddressDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching address data*/

    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetUser(IDbConnection connection, int id)
    {
        var user = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;User&gt;(GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery, new {UserId = id});
        if(user == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        user.MainAddress = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;Address&gt;(GetAddressDataSqlQuery, new {UserId = id});
        return user;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach requires two calls to a database, but it can be reduced by merging those two queries into a single string and executing it with <code>SqlMapper.GridReader</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserRepository
{
    static readonly string GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching user basic data*/
    static readonly string GetAddressDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching address data*/

     static readonly string GetUserCompleteDataSqlQuery = @$"
        -- Fetch user basic data
        {GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery};
        -- Fetch address data
        {GetAddressDataSqlQuery};
    ";    

    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetUser(IDbConnection connection, int id)
    {
        using var gridReader = await connection.QueryMultipleAsync(GetUserCompleteDataSqlQuery, new { UserId = id });
        var user = await gridReader.ReadFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;User&gt;();
        if (user == null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        user.MainAddress = await gridReader.ReadFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;Address&gt;();
        return user;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like this solution is much cleaner and requires less code than the option with the intermediate DBO object, but things can get really messy when we want to fetch data for more than one user and the relation between user and address is one-to-many:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetAllUsers(IDbConnection connection)
{
    using var gridReader = await connection.QueryMultipleAsync(GetUserCompleteDataSqlQuery);
    var users = …</code></pre></article></div>

<small>2020-08-03</small><!-- RSS:2020-08-03T07:25:00Z -->
<p>I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open
    source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only
    time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly
    onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful.</p>
<p>To settle a few things. When I tweeted on this subject I only got the response that I should use vim. Thanks. Great.
    I can and do on use vim. That misses a number of points. Visual Studio Code is an immensely popular editor and
    likely the most common recommendations to new developers. The primary reason I've used Visual Studio Code is
    that it has an incredibly compelling solution for remote pairing in the form of LiveShare. I've used that for a
    while with great success mentoring, coaching and generally working with other developers of varying experience and
    editor preferences. Most programmers can handle a "normal" editor like VS Code while something like Emacs
    or Vim depends a lot more on what they've learned.</p>
<p>I also ended up enjoying the Remote series of extensions for developing effectively inside remote servers or local
    containers.</p>
<h2>These things are proprietary</h2>
<p>At some point I read a piece of license that said that LiveShare could only be used with the Visual Studio family of
    products. "Huh, that sounds weird, VS Code is open source right?"</p>
<p>Sure enough. VS Code is fully MIT. The binary distribution has a separate license to allow telemetry and protect
    Microsoft trademarks and stuff. Nothing particularly weird, I can't really get worked up about telemetry, I know
    some can. But the extensions.. These extensions are in my book core differentiators that makes VS Code compelling.
    For me it is definitely part of what pushes it beyond the much leaner Sublime (paid, closed source) I was using
    before.</p>
<p>These extensions have a license limiting them and their online service parts to only be used with the Visual Studio
    family of products. This is the <a href="https://microsoftdocs.github.io/live-share/license/eula.html" title="License for LiveShare">license for LiveShare</a> and this is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license" title="License for Remote">license for Remote</a>.</p>
<p>For me LiveShare is the most important thing. Google Docs style collaborative code editing, terminal sharing, port
    sharing and a bunch more features. I know Atom had an extension like this, I haven't checked the licensing there
    or tried it recently.</p>
<p>Remote is a very strong extension as well for anyone working on a server over SSH or in a container. It helps by
    installing extensions on the destination to allow language servers and such. I've seen it do terrible things to
    servers sometimes but it is very useful and generally works well.</p>
<p>It makes me uneasy to accept VS Code as an "open" project in any wider meaning of the word when compelling
    features are legally locked to only work inside the family of Visual Studio products. It makes me less certain that
    this isn't the Extend in Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. It also frustrates me that this prevents someone from
    building a compatible plugin for VIM or any other editor. This would be much more powerful if it could be in all the
    IntelliJs as well.</p>
<p>You'll find a repo for <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share" title="LiveShare on GitHub">LiveShare on GitHub</a> but it is only for documentation and issue tracking. There
    is no code. Same for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release" title="Remote on GitHub">Remote</a>.</p>
<h2>The entire marketplace is proprietary</h2>
<p>Some additional salt in this particular wound is that the use of the Marketplace of VS Code extensions is also
    proprietarily licensed. So all these open source developers are shoving their extensions into a competitive
    advantage for one of the world's largest tech firms. And they disallow other uses of the marketplace. Even if
    the letter of open source is followed there is none of the openness, collaborative or community essence that I think
    exemplifies open source and free software projects.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? I guess it protects from the competition. Such as the <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium" title="VS Codium">VS Codium</a> project which provides VS Code
    binaries without the proprietary parts. But also, as a consequence of this, without the Marketplace of extensions.
    There is an open source alternative called <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" title="Open VSX">Open VSX</a>, but since
    it isn't the canonical one it is missing a bunch of extensions and the big Liveshare and Remote ones are still
    not allowed.</p>
<p>This also blocks the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server" title="code-server">code-server editor</a> that
    allows running VS Code in the browser from using it which otherwise would have been perfect for me to do development
    on an iPad Pro. I can still use that but a lot of packages are not in Open VSX.</p>
<h2>What about lock-in?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is marketed with LiveShare and Remote as powerful extensions. VS Code is also marketed as open
    source. It is easy to use the editor, install the extensions and be under the impression that you are using an open
    source software suite where Microsoft simply hosts the peering service for identifying and connecting you and your
    collaborator.</p>
<p>But the peering service is not the only closed part. The extensions are not open source projects as far as I can find
    and they are licensed during distribution in a way that disallows using them with anything but Visual Studio
    products.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't sold on having an Electron-based editor to begin with but
    VS Code was substantially leaner than Atom so I've been mostly accepting it.</p>
<p>If you have good suggestions for strong collaborative development tools that are open source, please let me know at
    <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. If you want to follow my writing the RSS feed is

<p>It is clear that Iain Godwin has tapped into a growing sense of unease, though, to be fair, rumblings of discontent have been heard many times over the past decade or so from a variety of software commentators and end-users. For example:</p>

</ul>
<p>Concerns about some software vendors’ monopolistic positions have also been raised internationally by industry organisations, including the <a href="http://www.fiec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Construction Industry Federation (FIEC</a>).</p>
<h3>FIEC position paper</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.fiec.eu/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg" alt="FIEC logo" width="300" height="117" srcset="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg 300w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-160x62.jpg 160w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo.jpg 443w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>On 24 February 2020, the FIEC published a position paper on the relationship between users and software companies/ editors/ service providers (<em><a href="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/2020-02-24-FIEC_position_on_software_companies-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a></em>). No vendors are named, but, from the similarity of the claims, Autodesk is clearly one of the software providers that FIEC is sufficiently concerned about to urge the European Commission to review competition and data management regulations. Its paper discusses challenges and makes recommendations under four headings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The dominant position of a few software companies/editors/providers raises major concerns.</strong> – The FIEC urges the European Commission to target competition issues relating to software user contracts</li>
<li><strong>The non-EU origin of these suppliers and their infrastructure is exacerbating the lack of autonomy in software capability in the EU.</strong> – The FIEC says EU software users should be allowed to decide where their data is stored (“EU companies should be able to have their data hosted on EU territory, by EU servers/companies, under EU legislation”), calls for the creation of a secure European Cloud, and says software services “should be required to meet EU standards for interoperability and open access”.</li>
<li><strong>Contracting authorities must remain software-neutral and promote open standards</strong>. – The FIEC calls for enforcement of EU public procurement rules, and urges promotion of open standards for data, protocols and file formats in public procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Rules need to be established for multiple-user-access platforms such as BIM models.</strong> – Similarly, the FIEC urges EU measures aimed at protecting the data owner while ensuring appropriate data access rights for other users.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Autodesk not alone in hosting, US dominance, interoperability issues</h3>
<p>Some of these issues are already familiar. Where project data is hosted has been a concern ever since Software-as-a-Service applications began to be deployed in the 1990s, and as use of construction collaboration platforms expanded in the early 2000s, most leading vendors have responded by creating localised hosting centres to serve different operational regions. Hosting&nbsp; project data in the United States, for example, has been resisted by most clients based in Europe and other parts of the world (eg: the Middle East, southeast Asia, etc; read <em>EE</em> August 2014 post <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2014/08/no-saas-safe-harbor/"><em>No SaaS ‘Safe Harbor’</em></a>).</p>
<p>Concentration of large portions of the construction software industry through merger and acquisition activity has resulted in an increasingly dominant position for US software giants. By gobbling up strong players in Europe, Australasia and elsewhere, Autodesk, Bentley, Oracle and Trimble have assembled strong AEC software portfolios, while some of the more generic US software providers such as Microsoft and IBM have also developed applications, services and relationships that give them an increasingly strong foothold in the AEC space.</p>
<p>And software interoperability has been a perennial issue that <em>EE</em> has covered since it started in 2005 (eg: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2005/09/new_roi_return_/"><em>New ROI: Return on Interoperability</em></a>, September 2005). BuildingSmart (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability) started out as an Autodesk initiative in the mid-1990s, but, over 25 years later, global shifts towards open standards are still proceeding almost glacially slowly, with Autodesk’s leading BIM authoring product “widely ridiculed” for its IFC import/export capabilities.</p>
<h3>Autodesk responds on key themes</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/views/reply-to-open-letter-on-revit"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/Autodesk-reply-300x205.jpg" alt="Autodesk reply" width="400" height="273" srcset="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/Autodesk-reply-300x205.jpg 300w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/Autodesk-reply-590x403.jpg 590w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/Autodesk-reply-768x524.jpg 768w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/Autodesk-reply-160x109.jpg 160w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/Autodesk-reply.jpg 1157w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a>Autodesk’s initial response</strong> (<a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2020/07/design-firms-demand-change-at-autodesk/"><em>see update to earlier EE post</em></a>) to the Godwin group’s open letter <strong>did not mention interoperability</strong> at all. However, a <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/views/reply-to-open-letter-on-revit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up blog post by Amy Bunzsel</a> published today (31 July 2020) addresses the main themes, and on openness and interoperability says: “<strong>We continue to invest in supporting IFC</strong> and based on customer feedback we’ve <strong>recently increased development for new industry requirements, focusing on IFCv4 certification</strong>.”</p>
<p>Bunzsel continues:</p>
<p>“Looking to the future, we believe that ways of working will evolve, from the direct modeling of today to outcome-based design driven by analysis…, to the convergence of manufacturing and construction, and that <strong>data needs to be unlocked from native formats and flow more readily throughout Autodesk and non-Autodesk products</strong>.”</p>
<h3>No more software silos</h3>

<p>3D Repo was created to enable the construction industry to work better together and to create better buildings.

<p>The current method of sharing information as files of entire 3D models can hinder collaboration. Tracking changes can also be problematic and inefficient for design communication. AEC Delta Mobility breaks down the file barriers to enable small design changes, known as ‘Deltas’, to be shared faster, more openly and more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the software industry should be working with the construction industry. Real solutions that involve working with customers and providing them with tools they will not want to walk away from, based on commercial terms that actually promote the collaborative behaviours we want to see, not divide us into software silos</strong>.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>I do hear sometimes from programmers who are kind of sad that they don't have the opportunity to write game engines from scratch like I did and have it matter or make an impact...</p> <p>-John Carmack</p></blockquote> <p>I was definitely a programmer who felt like I'd missed a golden era of opportunity. I didn't <em>really</em> start programming until my 30s. Just like many devs hoping to have an impact on the industry, it's sometimes felt like the golden era has already passed.</p> <p>Surveying the market from a more entreprenurial mindset and looking for a potential niche to fill with a SaaS app (or worse, a social network), the situation appears even more dire! News aggregators have been done and Reddit is thoroughly dominant. The professional social network is done and LinkedIn owns it. Market after market is done. <a href="https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done">Everything in tech is done.</a></p> <h2 id="technology-doesn-t-stay-technology"><a href="#technology-doesn-t-stay-technology">#</a> Technology doesn't stay technology</h2> <p>Part of the problem is the word "tech". There are two different—but overlapping—ideas that are both commonly referred to as "tech".</p> <p>By its literal definition, techonology is anything that involves <em>applying scientific knowledge for practical purposes</em>. In a literal sense, we're surrounded by tech. Some, such as the spoon are ancient and others, like the Kinesis keyboard I'm typing on are much newer.</p> <p>But people don't talk about ancient inventions like the fire bow, or Clovis points as "technology", outside of a historical context. Most people don't even call somewhat modern inventions like light bulbs, refrigerators or microwaves as technology either. When we call something technology, we generally mean something invented recently... <em>or</em> we mean something related to computers.</p> <p>Douglas Adams summed it up into three rules:</p> <ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li> <li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li> <li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li></ol> <p>Having a musician turned firmware hacker and then programmer for an uncle, I'm a bit more optimistic about aging and see the boundary as more about whether a given technology has been widespread for a decade or not.</p> <p>Cassette tapes and microwave ovens used to be fantastic new technologies in the late 60s and early 70s. Now they aren't. DVDs, the web and 3D video games used to be amazing technologies in the 90s. Now they're taken for granted. Smart phones were incredible in the late aughts. Now they're just phones.</p> <h2 id="when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing"><a href="#when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing">#</a> When pundits say "tech" they generally mean computing</h2> <p>The rapid advances in personal computing during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s was nothing short of breathtaking. Computers were gaining new powers every year or two and PCs were deprecating nearly 50% per year! The web took the boom to an exponentially growing number of users. [<a href="#1">1</a>]</p> <p>It's entirely natural that computer software dominated the discussion of technology for a generation. First journalists, and now many of us are referring to everything from web SaaS apps to mobile productivity apps as "tech".[<a href="#2">2</a>] Since the wider meaning of tech hasn't been abandoned, this makes it very easy to conflate the two.</p> <p>But not all technology is computing and not all computing is technology anymore.</p> <h2 id="where-is-the-edge"><a href="#where-is-the-edge">#</a> Where is the edge?</h2> <p>To an ambitious engineer looking for a market opportunity in "tech", things look crowded. Advances in programming languages, frameworks, open source collaboration, dev ops, visual site-building tools and more have made it <em>dramatically</em> easier to create both web apps and mobile apps than it was a decade ago. This has lead to a flood of competition and an increased importance of marketing and other skills an engineer might not have.</p> <p>But web apps aren't (necessarily) tech. They're "tech".</p> <p>But not all is lost for the aspiring engineer.</p> <p>There are newer technologies, closer to the frontier that aren't common in in 2020 but will be in 2030. Some of them are still wide open to people with more learning power than earning power. Bio-tech, blockchain, and VR <em>are</em> tech and the technical challenges to be solved are real. It's a lot harder to ship a product in those areas than to build yet another SaaS targeting small to medium sized businesses. But that's a <em>good</em> thing if technical skills are your strength.</p> <p>For those whose strengths lean more to the marketing, sales or design sides, the B2B SaaS may represent a better goal. This is good for everyone. There's vast landscape for different people with different comparative advantages to find their niches.</p> <h2 id="you-are-not-too-late"><a href="#you-are-not-too-late">#</a> You are not too late</h2> <blockquote><p>...here's where some perspective really helps - I can remember when I was a teenager, I thought I had missed the Golden Age of 8-bit Apple 2 gaming, that I was never going to be Richard Garriott...time went by, and I got to make my own marks in things after that. And, in that time, I also see so many opportunities that have come by.</p> <p>The 90s PC wave was great - I was happy to be there, and I'm glad I took a swing and knocked one out of the park with that. But since then, we've seen mobile games, and web games, and free-to-play games, the Steam revolution...and now virtual reality. And all of these are amazing!</p> <p>So, yeah, the opportunities that I had aren't there for people today - but there are new and better ones. And personally, I'm more excited about these than anything that's come before. So, thank you very much for this honor, but I'm just getting started.</p> <p>-John Carmack (BAFTA acceptance speech)</p></blockquote> <p>The speech John Carmack gave when accepting his BAFTA fellowship filled me more professional optimism than I've felt in quite a while. Even he felt like it was "too late" because of missing all the opportunities of the 80s.</p> <p>In retrospect, that seems crazy. The web was huge and just around the corner.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">#</a> Notes</h3> <p><a name="1">[1]</a> Well more of an S-curve, but it looked exponential then.</p> <div><p><a name="2">[2]</a> As one commenter on HN </p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a><p>, it's a spectrum. In Uber's early days, its technology was crucial to its business. Over time, they'll gradually become less of a tech company if they coast and stop innovating.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently went through the <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> program and <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">loved it</a>.</p>
<p>But the one sour note was that we only got $1,000 AWS credits when <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">the copy seemed to promise $5,000</a>. Our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-chose-a-marketing-and-app-monorepo">entire application infrastructure is on AWS</a> so those credits are pretty much straight-up cash to us. We don't have much of a digital footprint either, so $5,000 goes a long way.</p>
<p>That's why this weekend was such a surprise.</p>
<h3 id="the-email">The Email</h3>
<p>Here's how the timeline went.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">we posted an article</a> politely noticing that we hadn't been able to secure the full $5,000 and kinda wondering out loud why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://formcake.com/blog/the-founders-guide-to-stripe-atlas">Stripe contacted us</a> and explained that the credit amount was more of a lifetime cap and that it was ultimately up to AWS what we got.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We send <em>one more</em> email just 'cause, even though it seems clear AWS only offers $1,000 for bootstrapped startups. The email is simple and amounts to: "Is there any way we could get the full five thousand in credits?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stripe responds to this chain of events with yet another email, this one even kinder and more politely worded.</p>
<section>
Hey David,

<p>Thank you for sharing the details here. It sounds like we should be able to get this sorted out so that you receive the $5K in AWS credits for Stripe Atlas users.  </p>
<p>I believe it may be the case that you applied for AWS credits with a different link than the one shared for Stripe Atlas users to activate. We do not typically see users needing to answer the question regarding funding sources. I did check in with AWS on this and it sounds like they're currently processing your most recent application that you submitted through the Stripe Atlas link. They've let me know that they will email you directly with next steps, which may take up to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will all soon be sorted! If you do have any questions on this or anything else, please feel free to reach out! I'll check back in a couple weeks on the AWS front, or feel free to share any updates as well!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Taylor</p>
</section> 

<p>It looks like the funded/bootstrapped question indicated the process had gotten miffed somewhere and <em>Stripe reached out to AWS on our behalf</em> to make sure things got cleared up.</p>
<p>This weekend we saw $5,000 in credits enter our AWS account. Keep in mind that's actually <strong>in addition</strong> to the $1,000 we've already received, bringing out total up to $6,000 in AWS credits through the Stripe Atlas program.</p>
<p>For us this is a big injection. It basically funds our full application operations and lets us play around with putting money elsewhere - or just continuing to build features and mature without any kind of pressure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A couple of takeaways from the entire affair.</p>
<h4 id="1-send-that-one-last-email">1. Send that one last email</h4>
<p>Even if it seems like a bit much, or things are settled, just be sure you ask and give the other person a chance to help you in ways you can't predict. A hail mary "Is there anything I'm missing?" can sometimes land.</p>
<h4 id="2-stripe-is-truly-wonderful">2. Stripe is truly wonderful</h4>
<p>Stripe monitored the developer community enough to see our initial posts, proactively reached out to us, and then worked with AWS to ultimately get us a greater-than-even-promised payout. When people say Stripe is a company for developers, they often mean its great API or clear documentation, but this is I think one of the greatest testaments to their dev-first culture.</p>

                                <div><div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor, known for its upscale fashions and&nbsp;extravagant holiday window displays, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors after a turnaround effort faltered amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>

The oldest U.S. department store&nbsp;filed&nbsp;for Chapter 11 protection in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday and will submit a reorganization plan with the court. The company, founded in Manhattan by two English immigrants in 1826, said it had about US$137.9 million&nbsp;of debt obligations.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s owner, fashion&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;Le Tote Inc., filed for Chapter 11 along with the retail chain. Le Tote bought the rights to the companyâ€™s stores, brand and e-commerce site from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. for US$71 million last year.</p><p>

The company, with 38 stores and 651 employees as of the filing, joins a burgeoning list of department-store casualties tied to the virus, which turned malls into ghost towns. Former fashion stalwarts like J. Crew Group Inc. and Neiman Marcus Inc. already filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor closed all of its stores temporarily in March as governors ordered residents to shelter in place to combat the spreading virus. In court filings, company officials said they are slowly starting to reopen some stores and have recalled 400 employees.</p><p>

San Francisco-based Le Tote offers fashion-apparel rentals. Executives at the company have planned to cut the number of Lord &amp; Taylor stores and target younger women with luxury try-on studios, beauty subscriptions and rental drop-off points.</p><p>

Under the deal with Hudsonâ€™s Bay, the seller agreed to cover Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s rent for three years, saving Le Tote $58 million annually. Le Tote said in a court&nbsp;filing&nbsp;Sunday that its companies reported revenue of about US$253.5 million in 2019.</p></div>

<p>The economic body blows wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Le Tote into putting Lord &amp; Taylor into Chapter 11, Ed Kremer, the companyâ€™s chief restructuring officer, said Monday in court filings.</p>

<p>Le Tote officials were grappling with â€œcarrying the increased expenses associated with the acquisition, as well as the brick-and-mortar assets which were unusable for a substantial period of time,â€� Kremer said in the filings. â€œThese unprecedented market developments, compounded by lower-than-expected financial results, adversely impacted liquidityâ€� and left the retailer drowning in debt, he added.</p>

<p>Le Total officials cut a deal with lenders to allow them access to cash to fund an effort to sell the company and â€œmaximize value for all stakeholders,â€� Kremer added.</p>

<p>The case is Le Tote Inc.,&nbsp;20-33332, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).</p>

August 2, 2020 | https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/08/02/online-dating.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/08/02/online-dating.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>Online dating is as old as the internet. It has exploded in popularity in recent years: roughly <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/2506bda6ca9a8b7ce8b3c54b4/files/1a8cc94c-6198-4f3d-b27d-8a6060ed6c5d/Tyro_Dating_Market_Thesis_Final_For_Twitter_Pub_v2.pdf">40% of straight couples now meet online</a>. It has given women more safety and choice as they participate in the dating market, and brought down divorce rates as people date more widely and make better-informed decisions than in the past.</p> <p>However, these benefits are effects of online dating becoming <em>more common</em>, not <em>better</em>. The recipe for online dating itself has been static since the 90s: some pictures, a quick description of yourself and what you’re looking for in a partner, and endless looking through other profiles. No matter whether you’re on Hinge in 2020 or OKCupid in 2005, the structure is the same. Only the volume is different.</p> <p>Disappointingly, innovation in online dating has mostly been marginal. There are hundreds of dating apps, but differences are slim. Some limit the number of daily matches, others force someone to chat first, others yet differ in their question prompts to the users, etc. These are micro-optimizations, but of minimal value because the existing model is generally suboptimal.</p> <p>What’s broken in the current model is that it encourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification">preference falsification</a>. Normally, preference falsification is very overt – for example, when someone lies to their friends about which political candidate they’re going to vote for. In online dating, it’s subtle – people are usually not actively lying, but they are (often unknowingly) misrepresenting, to themselves and to others, who they are and what they’re looking for.</p> <h3 id="self-misrepresentation">Self-Misrepresentation</h3> <p>People struggle to represent themselves accurately for two core reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Self-knowledge is hard</li> <li>People try to make themselves appear as appealing as possible.</li> </ol> <p>The first point is obvious, though unpleasant: lots of people go through life doing things they hate, or simply killing time. Few manage to ultimately find their passions. I’m sure you’ve met people who were all about <em>Hobby X</em>, until they dropped it one day because it didn’t bring them joy and they were doing it for some other reason. The second point is twisted game theory: people are insecure in themselves, so they try to imagine what the opposite gender might most like to see, and then to ape that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p>Consequently, dating app profiles are full of wildly wishful descriptions – <em>surfer, investment banker, loves reading, passionate about sunsets</em>. When you meet the real person, it turns out they don’t care about sunsets and put that in purely as a romantic signal, and they’ve been surfing just once a year ago but they’d sure love to try it again. They actually spend 14 hours a day working and the remaining 2 watching <em>King of the Hill</em>, but they can’t write that – what would the other people on the app think? Surely they’re only interested in surfing, sunset-loving, well-read investment bankers.</p> <p>These dating app bios are not just unrealistic to appeal to potential matches, but also as constructions for the users themselves: no-one wants to admit to themselves that they are not living quite the life they aspire to. Thus, when you give them a paintbrush, they paint an idealized version of themselves. Reading is the dead giveaway: barely anyone actually reads books, but virtually everyone says they love reading. What they love is the idea of themselves being well-read. Consequently, a love of reading is an extremely common bio line, even when most people spend less than 1% of the year reading.</p> <h3 id="false-preferences-about-partners">False Preferences about Partners</h3> <p>People also struggle to accurately identify what they’re really looking for in a partner. Again, there are two main reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Filters are necessary on dating apps</li> <li>Knowing who is a good fit for you is another, even harder form of self-knowledge</li> </ol> <p>Because of the enormous number of people on dating apps, having filters is the only way to manage the quantity of potential matches. The trouble is that people usually have only weak priors to base those filters on. This is especially bad for younger people, who haven’t dated very much, and who might even fall to peer pressure dictating who they should date. They filter hard, and consequently never end up dating <em>broadly</em>, which would be the only way to figure out what kinds of people are good fits or not.</p> <p>This leads into the second reason – you try to filter for people who will be good fits, but that’s extremely difficult to know <em>a priori</em>. I’ve been personally surprised by this many times over. Every time I thought I knew <em>exactly</em> what kind of woman I wanted to date, life threw me a curveball and I fell for someone totally outside that box. By the time I was in my mid/late-20s, I learned to filter less: romantic attraction and compatibility was actually very difficult to predict without really getting to know the other person. I learned that common interests didn’t mean much, whereas common <em>attitudes</em> seemed to be the strongest predictor of a fit.</p> <p>But many people in the dating world aren’t having those experiences now. They filter so specifically that they never learn who else might be out there. I’m reminded of an acquaintance of mine – she spent the better part of three years aggressively dating only people more successful than her – and not a single one worked out. I was baffled that at no point did she ever consider whether her “I am only dating CEOs” mantra was the wrong filter.</p> <h3 id="outcomes-and-solutions">Outcomes and Solutions</h3> <p>The dating pool is large and liquid, but the core issue is that individual participants are hard to match because (1) they falsify who they are and (2) they falsify what they want in their partners. This makes it profoundly difficult to generate matches at a better-than-random rate. Both of these issues are fundamentally due to the user having too much choice, both in how they describe themselves and how they choose others. Importantly, these are not really blamable faults of the users, and it’s clear that the current generation of dating apps will not remedy these problems.</p> <p>I am hopeful that the next generation of dating apps will solve this issue by relying more on large-scale, latent data: I am imagining an app where an amalgamation of your Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, Google Search, etc. histories know you better than you know yourself – and that can be used to match you perfectly with a partner. I’ve been surprised that I haven’t seen such technology in the wild just yet. Probably the greatest obstacle to building a matching engine leveraging such data is that there isn’t any good training data to use, but I would’ve expected some of the big incumbents to use their datasets for this purpose by this point. We will see.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

      <p id="1eddbb67-5dd7-4557-bf2a-20c313c87466">My quest for programmable smartwatches lead me to a lot of googling sessions, during which I've discovered <a href="https://banglejs.com/">BangleJS</a>, open source smartwatches programmable with JavaScript.</p>
      
      
      <p id="a3b80dcb-b0c3-4f6a-9c47-ef0346ae1545">Right after the start, my first thoughts were: wow, colorful. The resolution looks good enough. Wait, what's with the weird position of the display?</p>
      
      
      <figure id="798a8fe6-d6a2-411d-b0f0-6c5e78b83a99">
        <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/2020-05-26_13.59.57.jpg" title="2020-05-26_13.59.57.jpg"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/2020-05-26_13.59.57_thumb.jpg"></a>
      </figure>
      <p id="3a71b0b9-1814-47aa-a4b1-1521ffe66566">Watches themselves boasts that you can make your own apps in JavaScript, so lets see how you do that.</p>
      
      <p id="f3b14ff4-8e9a-4997-930e-cd1c21416372">First <em>ouch</em> came when I've tried to pair the watches with my phone, and found out that you need paid third party application to do that. It costs 49kč, which is something like €2, so that's not that bad.</p>
      <figure id="9d8ee628-9f27-4187-9bfd-e90962077575">
        <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/2020-05-26_14.07.08.png" title="2020-05-26_14.07.08.png"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/2020-05-26_14.07.08.png"></a>
      </figure>
      <p id="2af66c09-7b54-40a2-b285-f9927c9e2b99">So I've downloaded it, paired my phone and watches and found out, that the watches won't receive the notifications, because the app doesn't support that. Lovely.</p>
      <p id="ce6b5ad2-e80a-4618-964d-d63b7eeabf6c">App's layout is super weird:</p>

        <div id="4c4c3cb6-b5cb-4910-a6a4-bb639bfdadaf">
          <figure id="3fc36ec1-e7d5-4cc5-a277-3722d7ad60f8">
            <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/2020-06-01_20.14.14.png" title="2020-06-01_20.14.14.png"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/2020-06-01_20.14.14.png"></a>

      </div>
      <p id="c1e4384d-fa12-41fd-9a6f-8f9e749473e2">It is actually just a web browser with Bluetooth support, so whole "app" is just <a href="https://banglejs.com/apps/">somebody's website</a>. That's actually good, because you can self-host your own marketplace pretty easily.</p>
      <p id="249ac407-6c31-45a8-80df-f0778453daf8">What's not good is that a Bluetooth support is just some basic serial console emulation, which means that Bluetooth upload is really, really slow. I've downloaded an app and the whole process took more than five minutes, failed several times, and I had to keep the app and the phone awake the whole time.</p>
      
      <p id="661f9a14-249d-4278-805b-b47417e06092">The dev environment is again, a web page. <em>Sigh</em>. You have to open <a href="https://www.espruino.com/ide/">https://www.espruino.com/ide/</a> and then connect the app on your phone, which will be able to upload apps to your watches.</p>
      
      <p id="71ce4d60-d53d-4c7a-8834-1ad6d42ede54">There is quite enough <a href="https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js">tutorials</a> on all kinds of topics:</p>
      <figure id="a6be609f-f782-45ec-beba-cd8da02d78cd">
        <a href="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/bangle_tutorials.jpg" title="bangle_tutorials.jpg"><img src="https://blog.rfox.eu/en/Improvements/The_Most_Personal_Device_experiment/BangleJS_opensource_smartwatches/bangle_tutorials_thumb.jpg"></a>
      </figure>
      <p id="897437ed-33e8-47ce-bbb8-8a4ef4dd31d7">I've been able to create simple application without any problems, I've uploaded it to the watches and everything worked just fine. So this part of the project is quite well done, except for the web IDE, which is obviously just the most basic editor. But it is usable.</p>
      
      <p id="2bb45af3-4640-4cf1-aa7b-04fd5a93bc19">I've decided to upgrade the firmware, because I've found this thread on the forum, from the guy that added experimental support for iPhone notifications:</p>

The upload is of course extremely slow, because it uses the same serial console emulation.</p>

      <p id="1b1cf268-13a1-42ec-baf9-753a8f5444c0">After a few days of usage, I've decided to sell the watches, because:</p>

      <ol id="14eca968-11f4-48f1-9613-9390fe5c0c9a" start="3">
        <li>The watches couldn't keep time. Quite absurd really, but they diverged by more than ten minutes / day, even after firmware upgrade.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="a17ed4b1-8d16-4c25-b6ef-b7201ec572b2" start="4">
        <li>No easy way to make notifications work on iOS / iPhone. It is quite possible that this will get better with time, but my patience run out.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p id="8e00e5e7-9381-4006-addf-443f95c4e8de">The watches are relatively cheap. They are <em>hackable</em>, and you can really change everything. This has its disadvantage in that the community is relatively small, and almost everything is a hack, or in a <em>proof of concept</em> stage of development.</p>
      <p id="55e00f07-08a1-47d1-ad0e-511913d80313">I could probably make an app (or watch face) that would automatically correct the diverged time. I could add some kind of notification support, and integration with calendar and all that standard stuff, all users of smartwatches are used to. Everything is probably fixable, given enough attention and time.</p>
      <p id="b997dcfa-762e-4883-821b-70993572d147">Overall, I've decided that this is not the right project for me, as it is one of those thing, that act like babies; you have to take care of them, feed them, keep informed about them and generally give a lot of attention to them. And I don't have enough time for that.</p>

          Lesson learned about all alternative smartwatch project is that the ecosystem matters, and the app for your mobile matters most. Without it, you don't really have smartwatches, you have programmable watches locked out of the rest of your info-sphere.

<p>Here's something for nobody. We've been past this a long while ago now.
OOP is one of those substances that stick to the wall if you throw it.
Writing about it is almost always pointless because
people who should learn refuse to learn,
and everybody else has learnt their lesson.</p>
<p>I review and criticize
<a href="https://medium.com/young-coder/the-case-against-oop-is-wildly-overstated-572eae5ab495">"The Case Against OOP is Wildly Overstated"</a> by Matthew MacDonald.
The article itself references few other posts and I give the same treatment to those.
You may have seen these before:</p>

</ol>
<p><em>I go through the main points of these posts so that you don't need to read them.</em>
<strong>Additionally we'll have</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A peek into Grady Booch's book
from which "4 pillars of OOP" is claimed to originate from.</li>
<li>How the whole <em>OOP is a lauded proglang hack to a record datatype</em>.</li>
<li>Predictable alternative for polymorphism (parametric polymorphism).</li>
<li>Why pattern matching doesn't do dynamic dispatch but is instead a substitute for inheritance.</li>
<li>Misconceptions you might have about types.</li>
<li>Why "no" for multiple dispatch.</li>
<li>How <code>"dog extends animal"</code> is not evil because you got isomorphisms.</li>
<li>Logic programming hidden in sight at Haskell programming language.</li>
<li>Concluding with a methematical explanation why OOP sucks big time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every weekend you get to see such a jewel in the sewer that's the Internet.
Lets peek in!</p>
<h2>Micro-summaries/reviews of OOP posts</h2>
<p>On each post I'll go through the main points they had to say.
Ilya's post was largest of them all with 27min read,
the second largest was Karsten's post.</p>
<p>I've got my opinions inserted in and the things I pick
up form the basis for subjects that the rest of this post covers.</p>
<h3>The trillion dollar disaster</h3>
<p>Ilya SuzdaInitski makes lot of claims but doesn't bother to present evidence.
He makes that up by doing a lot and lot of claims.
There are plenty of references to popular anti-OOP stuff so it's not a total loss.
Also it's a structured post that's easy to skim unlike the others in this bunch.</p>
<p>The high point in this post is Edsger W. Dijkstra's quote
"Object oriented programs are offered as alternatives to correct ones..."
I chuckled at that one, yeah Dijkstra obsessed over correctness and
I guess I've ended up to doing that as well.</p>
<p><strong>All the claims:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There's no evidence that OOP is better than plain procedural programming.</li>
<li>Programming paradigms should constrain bad programmers from doing too much damage.</li>
<li>Object oriented programming was supposed to be about messages and actors,
rather than about objects and methods.</li>
<li>OOP fails to keep the complexity because of
shared mutable state, errorneous abstractions and low signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
<li>Shared mutable state is hard to track and causes concurrency issues.</li>
<li>Encapsulation is a trojan horse hiding mutable state.</li>
<li>OOP tries to model the real world as objects and class trees through inheritance.</li>
<li>OOP is difficult to unit test.</li>
<li>Forms heavy dependencies between classes unless
you create interfaces everywhere and then mock them.</li>
<li>Difficult to refactor without tools.</li>
<li>Mentions design patterns, SOLID, dependency injection as band-aids to OOP.</li>
<li>Mentions abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
 as four pillars of OOP <em>with intent to refute these</em>.</li>
<li>OOP is popular due to Java.</li>
<li>It's time to move on.</li>
<li>You're already a functional programmer
 and learning functional programming makes you better.</li>
<li>Usual defensive arguments are weak and probably never met a true functional language.</li>
<li>Talks about Law of Demeter as useless under-the-rug-sweep.</li>
<li>People try to discredit anything that claim OOP sucks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notable references:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mentions functional programming and Linus Tolvalds hating on C++ programming.</li>
<li>Alan Kay's famous quote and refers to Erlang as a "pure form" implementation of OOP. </li>
<li>Stevey Yegge's blogpost "Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns".
I prefer the <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~decker/courses/280f07/paper/KingJava.pdf">PDF version of Yegge's post</a>.
It's criticizing Java programming language for sticking to OOP.
<em>I somehow remembered you could find it from the old <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/">WikiWikiWeb</a> but I didn't find it there. Just thought it might be fun to remember that site.</em></li>
<li>Reference to problem factory. I'm sure this is a reference.
<em>I just don't know this one. Help welcome! Remind me where the problem factory -term originated from? Yes, there's a design pattern called 'factory', I don't ask about that.</em></li>
<li>Reference to Joe Armstrong's "Banana, Gorilla, Jungle" -quote.</li>
<li>Transition from horses to automobiles used as argumentation device.</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, Alan Kay's remark about classes and objects cannot be used against OOP.
<em>Classes and objects were featured in Simula programming language and it went along from there.</em>
That it was inspired by something potentially better doesn't demerit it.
<em>OOP is a datatype customization feature with an overinflated ego.</em>
It exposes decades old implementation details and makes them a principal model where you do programming.</p>
<p>The conception that you discard shared mutable state
when you stop doing OOP is the thing that keeps people in.
<em>You can do "immutable" OOP and it's not any better!</em></p>
<p><em>Taxonomies and attempts to understand the world through them aren't OOP's problem.</em>
Besides when you pick this up they point out that you're not supposed
to write classes such as a "Car" or a "Banana"
and they're just as wrong as Ilya is wrong claiming the opposite.</p>
<p>OOP was verbose from the beginning and it didn't prevent it from going.
You're supposed to buy stuff with that verbosity so
bickering about "low-signal-to-noise" ratio receives eye rolls only.</p>
<p>They're going to tell you that they're using tools for refactoring
and just declare interfaces everywhere so that it can be unit tested.
IDE refactors the boilerplate code so they don't worry about it.
Interfaces and mocks just everywhere and it is not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>On claims of unit testing and OOP</strong>,
I'm not going to go there much more because I still don't unit test my stuff.
I'm currently not against it. I just don't know about it much.
I find it much easier to formally verify things correct
than to test that they're correct.</p>
<p><strong>OOP precedes Java.</strong>
<em>C++ was raging hot popular object oriented language before Java became popular.</em></p>
<h3>Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>Charles Scalfani was "gung-ho to leverage
the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism".
He was disappointed that the planes didn't land to his backyard.</p>
<ol>
<li>Half the post is about the banana-monkey-jungle problem.</li>
<li>Other half is about the fragile base class and contain-and-delegate as a solution to it.</li>
<li>Categorical hierarchies (taxonomies) don't work for programming?</li>
<li>Encapsulation doesn't work because it hides stateful variables.</li>
<li>You don't need object oriented programming for polymoprhism.
Presents interface-based polymorphism as an alternative.</li>
<li>Shills Elm. <em>Lol. (Scalfani's post is from 2006)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>These guys attack the pillars of OOP a lot.
This is why I did look into Grady Booch's book.</p>
<p><em>I guess it'll be also time to talk about these taxonomies and maps.</em>
Is this going to be the programmer equivalent of bees and flowers talk?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class">The fragile base class -problem</a>
seem to be well-covered and settled and has not affected the remaining discussion,
so I didn't cover that one here.
What it's about: Seemingly safe modifications to a base class may
cause the derived classes to malfunction.
The programmer cannot determine whether base class modification is safe
simply by examining the base class in isolation.</p>
<p>He mentions interface-based polymorphism as an alternative
<em>but doesn't say what it is or link to anything!</em></p>
<p><strong>Elm</strong> has become a laughing stock.
They skipped typeclasses in hopes that something better appears.
So far they're still waiting for it and they got full libraries.
They've done plenty of things to make it simple for a beginner
but when it comes to retaining users, LOL.
The language enforces its own best practices and it's getting to your way
by limiting the size of tuples that you can make,
tripping your homogeneous coordinate construction,
and banning <code>undefined/absurd</code> in release.</p>
<p>Here's absurd from Idris, so you get some idea what they prevent in release.</p>
<pre><code>absurd : Uninhabited t =&gt; t -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Non-dependent languages don't have this,
but they got <code>undefined</code> for the same purpose.
Elm has this too but it's in debug module and prevents its use in release.
It's very fun to wrap the function into a maybe
and handle it without the maybe monad,
or come up with a placeholder value,
when you know for certain that it's something that
means the program has something very badly wrong if it happens.
Nah, it's <code>Nothing</code>, tells Elm!</p>
<h3>Why OOP is bad</h3>
<p>Konrad Musial tells how he used to be excited about OOP.
He learned about circles and ellipses as objects with properties.
This is a story about struggling to understand OOP.
As an example he throws in a bit of C#.
Glancing at this code, it's not particularly complex
but sprinkled with attributes like this <code>[Serializable]</code> here.</p>
<pre><code>[Serializable]
</code><code>public class SampleClass {}</code></pre>
<p><em>These aren't technically even OOP.</em>
They're C#'s way to give code additional declarations and structure
that can be used for metaprogramming.
It's one of the flagship features of C#,
something you should definitely know how to use if you're going to use that language.</p>
<p>The post is filled with popular anti-OOP quotes and in the end
he tells us he figured it out and went back to doing OOP.
Week or two later he wrote "Why OOP is Awesome".
<em>That you don't understand something doesn't mean it's flawed or bad.</em></p>
<p><em>This one is a prose-formed text and it's not the only.</em>
<em>I struggled to go through these despite them being shortest in the bunch.</em>
It requires that I read the whole text through in at an one throw.
I just recently figured out myself the pieces I was missing to writing
<a href="http://boxbase.org/entries/2020/jul/20/on-how-i-write/">effortlessly skimmable texts</a>.
I don't say that I perfected it but you're reading one text
that's been <em>almost</em> written in this style.</p>
<h3>OOP is dead</h3>
<p>Karsten Wagner thinks OOP reached its peak and is on the decline.
Interest is increasing toward functional programming …</p></article></div>

                <p>In the last two weeks, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterZaitsev">Peter Zaitsev</a> published a 4-part series on measuring Linux performance on this blog.</p>
<p>His writings cover the 4 main areas where you can spot performance problems on any Linux machine, with practical tips on how to draw the right conclusions. Here are the individual pieces:</p>
<ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the past couple of months, folks asked me how I got into product management. While everyone probably wants to hear an overly romanticized story about how this was my passion from an early age, the reality is much funnier - it was an accident. I never had any plan to be in product management, and yet, this is how I built my career. This essay is a story of how I got to be in the role I am today.</p>

<p>The year is 2012. I am a junior at Wichita State University in Wichita, KS, looking for my summer internship. I’ve always aspired to build a career in software engineering - ever since the early days when I first had access to a computer, I wanted to get better at writing code and ultimately work for one of the big companies that make the software the world runs on.</p>

<p>Now, I am dead serious when I say that it’s something that I was really into since the late 90s, when I would come to my parents’ office after school with the goal to drink some tea, grab a snack, and browse programming forums. Back then, for me it was all about the power of Visual Basic 6. No other tool I knew could make graphical user interface (GUI) design as intuitive or easy to fiddle with. I even have photographic proof of my time as an incompetent novice engineer, trying to ask questions from professionals online.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/den-early-days.jpg" alt="Early days of my engineering career"></p>

<p>To give you an idea how serious I was about actually being employed by a large company in the software engineering space, I, once again, am able to summon photographic proof, thanks to my parents taking quite a few absolutely random photos of occasions that probably didn’t warrant a photo. Nonetheless, here I am, in the same parents’ office in Eastern Europe, looking at Microsoft employment information, with another tab open to the now-defunct MSDN Magazine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/den-looking-at-computer.jpg" alt="Looking at Microsoft employment information on a CRT monitor"></p>

<p>But I digress. Back in my college years, I was very certain that the kind of internship that I wanted to get was one where it will be possible for me to write code. The effort I put into learning the fundamentals of programming should be put to use in an area that is best suitable for that kind of skill. Given my experience with Microsoft folks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, I went ahead and started looking for internships at the same company.</p>

<p>I vividly recall that there were three options that I could choose from: software development engineer (SDE), software development engineer in test (SDET, which is no longer a role at Microsoft), and program manager (PM). Thanks to the magic of the Internet Archive, I was able to travel back in time and look at the exact page that led me to make my career decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/internship-site.png" alt="Microsoft internship site back in 2012"></p>

<p>On that page, SDE was the primary focus - it was <em>the</em> role to be in if one wanted to create software, but the PM role sounded just as intriguing, even though less emphasized. Up until that point, I never actually formally researched what the role itself entailed, and my mouse cursor was already hovering over the SDE link. Naturally, I clicked on the PM link instead, and started reading the description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[…] you drive the technical vision, design and implementation of next-generation software solutions. You predict and research how software is used and work closely with Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) to ensure our end products exceed those expectations.</p>

<p>You gather customer requirements, write functional specifications and analyze usage cases to represent customers’ needs throughout the development process. You’ll invest your time in partnering with other product teams across Microsoft to drive collaborative solutions. If you love negotiating, evangelizing and empathizing on behalf of our customers, the PM role is for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was done reading it, the first thought that popped into my mind was “<em>Well, I haven’t really taken any product management courses in college. Should I have?</em>” The breadth of skills that were needed were <em>kind of</em> aligned with what I knew the basics of, but I also had no idea how to “negotiate and evangelize.” How would I even go about gaining any experience like this as a junior in college? Thinking back, one is likely to have at least a few opportunities for growing those skills during their higher education years, such as joining student organizations (<em>which I did later</em>) or participating in student government, among other things. That did not negate the fact that the path to expertise here was pretty opaque for someone that had no idea what it takes to be a good program/product manager.</p>

<p>And while we are talking about product management - you already noticed that at Microsoft this role is called “<em>Program Manager</em>.” You will see semantics of the title change from company to company, but the core competencies will remain the same. There are also variations of the PM role, such as Technical Program Manager (TPM), and Product Manager - Technical (PM-T), but that is a story for another article.</p>

<p>Before you knew it, I was sending my resume for the role. A couple of days later, I got confirmation that Microsoft was interested in talking to me - the next step was the phone informational. I briefly chatted with my friend Clint<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> - he was super-helpful in outlining some hypothetical scenarios that I needed to prepare for in the interview. All of them revolved around determining my way of thinking. As it turns out, when I was applying for the PM internship, the most important thing that the interviewer was looking at was not my earlier experience, but rather the approach that I am taking to problem solving. I tried to walk through some product management “riddles” that I found online, but come phone interview time, they all flew out of the window.</p>

<p>“<em>So, imagine that you are designing an appliance. What would be the information you would need to be able to determine what to build?</em>” was the first question that I got asked. This was <em>nothing</em> like the riddles that I was preparing myself to answer. I tried to walk through the process and mentioned that I would first do some market research, and try to understand what are the existing market needs. The interviewer and I discussed the ins and outs of how I would go about finding the right customers to talk to, what to do if customers are asking for something that my company was not best suited for, and what would be the steps to start implementing the project. My “zero experience in product management” answers were good enough, so I was moved to the next stage - a couple of days later, I got an email letting me know that I am invited to an on-site interview. Sure enough, a couple of weeks later I was taking a cab from a hotel in Bellevue to the main Redmond campus.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, my recruiting contact handed me the information sheet for the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/internship-interview-slip.png" alt="Microsoft internship interview slip"></p>

<p>Nice! Up until that point, I did not know what team I will be interviewing for. Looking at the sheet, it said <strong>WPD</strong>, which was <strong>Windows Phone Division.</strong> That was exciting to me, because at the time I was a Windows Phone Development MVP, and the platform was near and dear to my heart. “<em>I can hit this out of the ballpark,</em>” I thought. I knew so much about Windows Phone, and I was comfortable both discussing the nice and not-so-nice things about the platform, and code around those. In hindsight, I probably wasn’t as much of an expert as I assumed I would be, but the confidence was there nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/visitor-pass.png" alt="Microsoft visitor pass"></p>

<p>I step into the building, and the first thing I see on walls around me is a bunch of different Microsoft Office posters. An odd choice for a Windows Phone building, but maybe these folks are just passionate about Office? As I step into the office with my first interviewer, they introduce themselves and start talking about their job. And then it hits me - they do not work on Windows Phone. They work in the Office division. This is going to be a PM interview for Office, and I am not prepared for it at all. I used Office a lot, but off top of my head I was not quite sure how things like its extensibility platform or the web stack worked. Things I wish I knew before the interview.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that all the interviewers throughout that day could tell that I was nervous. The questions were a mix of behavioral, thinking big, and technical product aspects. I was so nervous, that I barely recall what I discussed during <strong>four different conversations.</strong> The one thing I do remember was that I had to whiteboard a solution to a multiplayer version of a Rubik’s cube. I jotted down how I would use XML to store and pass cube state between machines, and ensure that every player had the other cube represent the true state of their opponent’s toy. The solution needed to be designed to be resilient to network outages and potential manipulation. That was probably the only question where I felt sure that I knew what I was doing - I was used to dealing with the technical stack more so than with the human stack.</p>

<p>The day went well, because my last meeting was the “as appropriate” interview with the Outlook group program manager (GPM), who, and somehow I do remember this, wore cowboy boots to the office. Unlike the previous interviews, he didn’t want to ask me questions, and instead had me ask him questions about his organization, type of work the folks do, and his career path. The conversation was very laid-back, and I felt that I was finally through the hardest part of the process. Around 4PM that day, I walked back to the HR building, and discussed the day with my recruiter. “<em>Thank you for coming, we’ll let you know of the results in a week or so.</em>” At least it was not a no-hire on the spot, I thought.</p>

<p>As I walked out of the building, and was waiting for the shuttle to the hotel, my phone rang. “<em>Hi Den, I just had a brief sync with the team, they would love to extend you an offer for a summer internship as a program manager. What do you think?</em>” This was the moment when I realized - I will be a program manager. While I knew nothing about what it means to be a good PM, at least I had enough of a base that the team thought I was a good fit. “<em>Uh… …</em></p></div></div>

<h2 id="the-hunt-for-text-to-speech">The Hunt for Text To Speech</h2>

<p>I have been searching for an offline text to speech library for a while now.  A couple of future side projects I’m considering are a voice assistant and converting ebooks or blog posts into audio so I can listen to them rather than read.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-text-to-speech-api">Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API</h3>

<p>Google offers a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a> that is priced at $4 / 1 million characters or $16 / 1 million characters for the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices">advanced WaveNet voices</a>.  The variety of voices and languages is impressive, but I was more interested in finding an offline solution, even if it produces lower quality audio.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-polly">Amazon Polly</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Amazon offers an API as well called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">Amazon Polly</a>.  The variety of voices appears to be a bit less than Google’s offering and the number of supported languages is also behind.  The pricing is the same as Google’s with a cheaper standard model and a more expensive “neural” model.</p>

<h3 id="espeak">eSpeak</h3>

<p>I figured there would be a fairly simple command line program that would do fairly basic and robotic speech-to-text.  <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a> emerged as an option and I gave it a try.  <code>sudo apt-get install espeak</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>espeak "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, I'm possible! Audrey Hepburn" -w output.wav
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/audio/impossible-quote-espeak.mp3">&lt;/source&gt;
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio></p><p>eSpeak scores some major points for simplicity.  Unfortunately, the speech is quite robotic and annoying to listen to.  I continued my search until I found Mozilla TTS.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-tts">Mozilla TTS</h2>

<p>I finally stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS">https://github.com/mozilla/TTS</a>, a project that is a part of <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en">Mozilla Common Voice</a>.  Mozilla’s mission, “Keep the internet open and accessible to all”, captures what they do well.  It also exemplifies a belief likely held by most software engineers.  With Common Voice, Mozilla is attempting to collect a large publically available dataset of labelled speech.  <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> was a similar project <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">ignited the development of computer vision models</a> by providing a massive list of labeled images that researchers could freely access.  With a public dataset, it was possible to design these models outside of the major companies (like Google and Amazon) that already had private access to this kind of data.  The Common Voice website makes it easy to either donate your voice or validate others.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-run-mozilla-tts">How to Run Mozilla TTS</h3>

<p>I was surprised to find that the main Readme didn’t really have straightforward instructions for how to run, or even what the end product was when you did finally run it.  Their wiki included some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Build-instructions-for-server">Build Instructions</a>, but after following them I was unable to get things running because the config file provided did not have all the values set.  After diving through some issues, I could tell there were quite a few parameters that even if I could identify them wouldn’t know what to set them to.  Thankfully, below the models and configs you were supposed to download was a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Released-Models#simple-packaging---self-contained-package-that-runs-an-http-api-for-a-pre-trained-tts-model">simpler route</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Create a fresh virtual environment with Python 3.6</span>
apt-get <span>install </span>espeak libsndfile1
pip <span>install </span>https://github.com/reuben/TTS/releases/download/ljspeech-fwd-attn-pwgan/TTS-0.0.1+92aea2a-py3-none-any.whl
python <span>-m</span> TTS.server.server
<span># Open http://localhost:5002</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/images/Mozilla-TTS.png" alt="Mozilla TTS"></p>

<p>The output was pretty good overall (this is the one used at the <a href="#mozilla-tts-quote">top of the article</a>).  However, if I were to use this in any kind of a project, I would not want to have to manually enter it in to the browser and manually download outputs.  I dug a bit deeper to see if I could extract a fairly simple CLI based on the web application.</p>

<p>I was able to modify the included <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/master/server/server.py">server.py</a> file to run on the command line instead of the Flask application it really was.  I added a text argument so the input file could be passed in and updated the export to write the bytes to a user specified .wav file.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-mozilla-tts-stack-up">How Does Mozilla TTS Stack Up?</h3>

<p>The first test I ran was on a random short story I found <a href="https://www.classicshorts.com/stories/aos.html">here</a>.  At about 16 seconds in to the clip below, the output appears to choke on the word pasture.  It manages to recover quickly, but not before letting out a ghoulish “ttteeeeaaarrr” at around 26 seconds.  When I first heard the stuttering I was laughing.  Now I think I may need to sleep with the lights on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They even executed a few innocent people to prove that they knew how to kill, and in roaming through virgin fields still belonging to the Prussians they shot stray dogs, cows chewing the cud in peace or sick horses put out to pasture.</p>

  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/audio/mozilla-tts-stutter.mp3">&lt;/source&gt;
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio></p><p>This was the only “bug” I really ran in to while using.  Otherwise, I was quite impressed with the performance.  While it doesn’t quite sound as “human-like” as the paid alternatives, it is a huge step up from the eSpeak option.  The project will likely see more improvements as time goes on and their dataset improves.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>At some point I will likely want to explore the opposite direction: speech-to-text.  Mozilla apparently has things covered there with <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">DeepSpeech</a>, a project that appears to have significantly more support at the moment.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

<h3 id="quick-refresher">Quick Refresher</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/eigenvector_scaling.png" width="300">
    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Image Source: Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constants <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">
    We first split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into its eigenvector subcomponents.
</p>

<p>When we have this representation, we can then rethink <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v = A^3(c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>or more simply:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v = c_1 \cdot A^3v_1 + c_2\cdot A^3v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/process.png">
    We then carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mn>3</mn><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^33v_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>We then carry out the computation of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/combine.png">
    We finally combine the results to get <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>

<p>We then finally combine the results to get <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> We find:</p>

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_1|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_2|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_1| &gt; |\lambda_2|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

<p>There are rumors about NVIDIA in advanced talks of buying ARM. Softbank has been in need of cash injection for some time, and ARM itself is a good asset.</p>
<p>The question to ponder, more interestingly, is how the synergy would work out for ARM and its potential buyers.</p>
<h2 id="nvidia">NVIDIA<a href="#nvidia" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>NVIDIA has some presences in mobile. From its ill-fated Denver CPU to the modest success with Tegra X1 in Shield and Nintendo Switch, for one, it is not lack of trying. So far, NVIDIA has established itself as an interesting player in the mobile space, while not gaining meaningful market share in the otherwise vast mobile market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NVIDIA’s data center business has enjoyed a strong growth trajectory in the past a few years. It has established itself, rightfully, as the go-to choice for any high-performance computing needs.</p>
<p>It is likely that the acquisition of ARM won’t be for the mobile market share. With a strong CPU design portfolio like ARM, NVIDIA can have more flexibility in its high-performance computing package design. Right now, NVIDIA’s flag-ship design is DGX A100, with its CPU being AMD Epyc. The past few years, in the high-performance computing world, the role of the CPU is transitioning from computing powerhouse, to a computation coordinator. This is particularly obvious from the accelerated development pace of PCIe 4 and PCIe 5 standard.</p>
<p>That won’t be nearly enough for Jensen Huang. Mobile-based solutions such as NVIDIA Xavier have been based on the shared memory design for quite some time. While there are challenges particularly on cache coherency model for such design, a CPU-GPU shared memory design would alleviate many pains for software developers to unlock the computation power of such a machine. The recent deep-learning models have been hinting a future of at least two orders of magnitude more parameters. To accommodate these new trends, a bigger departure from current PCIe based interconnect and form factor for accelerated computing co-processor is needed badly.</p>
<h2 id="apple">Apple<a href="#apple" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One thing interesting about Jensen is that for the past two decades, he always has the right insight. However, his endeavors were expensive for the company to pursue, with an often stretched credit line.</p>
<p>Apple has far more cash reserves for such an expensive purchase. But an ARM purchase would be a defensive move. Apple’s roadmap, while heavily ARM-based, doesn’t require radical departure from what ARM’s currently doing. The cost of inaction to Apple, would be a new adversary owner of ARM. From the past track record, NVIDIA's ARM would likely not prioritize any Apple’s request.</p>
<p>Apple had made defensive purchases in the past, and has the habit of hoarding good technology companies for many years until its technology has matured. Apple’s ARM purchase would be boring, but a strategically important one for them.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google<a href="#google" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Google’s ARM would be a distracted one. There are many product lines within Google that would benefit from an ARM purchase, from its mobile phone, Chromebook to its data center. The distraction and the likely politics interplay will likely terminate these endeavors prematurely. This will be an OK turnout for its competitors such as Apple. A Google’s ARM won’t be anywhere near as adversarial to them as NVIDIA's purchase.</p>
<p>A good asset like ARM would have many potential buyers. Many of them I didn’t cover here but equally likely. To me, as an interested observer, the most exciting one would be NVIDIA by far.</p>

		<p>This web page contains a simple Javascript that creates and configures a CouchDB user and database on a CouchDB installed on your desktop computer.</p>

		<p>Get CouchDB here: <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/" title="Get CouchDB">https://couchdb.apache.org/</a></p>
		
		<p>After you've installed and opened CouchDB you'll be prompted to create an "Admin User".</p>
		
		<p>After you've created your CouchDB admin user you can use the form below to setup the "Rich Text" app to use your CouchDB to save your documents in. </p>
		
		<p>When you submit the form below it will create a regular CouchDB user and database on your CouchDB. When that's done you'll be redirected to the text app page and prompted to login with the username and password you entered in this form. </p>
		
		<p>This page's source contains all the Javascript code to create a user and a database in a CouchDB installed on your desktop PC.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://cherrypc.com/app/editor/index.html" target="new" title="Text Editor HTML Source">Text Editor app page</a> source code contains all the Javascript code to login and create, save, update, list, display, and delete the rich text documents that are stored in your CouchDB.</p>
		
		<p>Together, these two web pages provide a very simple and complete example of how to create a Local-First web app using CouchDB to store user data on the client side.</p>
		
		<p>The database routines use <a href="https://pouchdb.com/" title="PouchDB Docs">PouchDB.js</a></p>

		<p>Authentication uses <a href="https://github.com/pouchdb-community/pouchdb-authentication/blob/master/docs/api.md" title="PouchDB-Authentication Docs">PouchDB-Authentication.js</a> </p>

		<p>The text app uses this<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content" title="Mozilla Guide"> rich text demo provided by Mozilla</a>.</p>
	</div><div>
		
		<p><small>You're welcome to copy the source code for both this and the app page.</small></p>
		<p><small>All of the app code is in the source of these two pages.</small></p>
		<p><small>All Javascript dependencies are supplied by CDNs except for <a href="https://github.com/pouchdb-community/pouchdb-authentication/blob/master/docs/api.md" title="PouchDB-Authentication Docs">PouchDB-Authentication.js</a> (I couldn't find one for it)</small></p>
		<p><small>This demo is intentionally as simple and sparse as I felt I could get away with. It's the example code in the html source of this and the Text Editor app page linked above that's of interest here. </small></p>
		
		<p><small>You really should copy the two pages linked and run them on your own web server. And you should either edit out the authentication routines or go get pouchdb.authentication and use it. The docs for that are worth diving into anyway if your going to make web apps with CouchDB.</small></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9733"><div><div><div><h2>Google acquired North which made smart glasses similar to Google Glass on June 30, North decides to kill its flagship Focals smart glasses on July 31st</h2><p>Last week we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/amazon-allegedly-stealing-tech-from-startups-under-the-pretext-of-funding-them/">reported how Amazon</a> had been accused of using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon allegedly invested in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. Amazon used such confidential information to launch its own services. Google has far worse compared to Amazon.</p><p>On 30th June, Google announced acquiring North, a smart glass maker. Google reportedly paid upwards of $150 million to acquire the Canadian 8-year-old startup, North which started off as Thalmic Labs. North was manufacturing smart glasses called Focals smart glass. At the time of Google’s acquisition, It had started shipping the Focals 1.0 and in the process of developing next-gen, Focals 2.0.</p><p>It seemed natural that Google would be interested in North as its product line was similar to Google Glass. “We’re building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google had said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/google-acquires-north-augmented-reality-glasses-start-up.html">statement that time</a>. “North’s technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.”</p><p>Exactly one month after Google’s acquisition, North has killed off its flagship product.&nbsp;In a statement on the <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">North website</a>, it says that Focals smart glasses will not be sold any longer beginning July 31.&nbsp;“Focals smart glasses and its services are being discontinued and will no longer be available after July 31st, 2020. You won’t be able to connect your glasses through the app or use any features, abilities, or experiments from your glasses,” the statement reads.</p><p>Not only is North killing its flagship Focals 1.0 smart glasses, but it is also stopping work on the upcoming Focals 2.0 completely.&nbsp;The website says that customers who ordered the Focals 1.0 smart glasses after June 30 are provided with a refund.</p><h2>Google’s predatory instincts</h2><p>Google refused to comment on North killing off its Focals 1.0 and 2.0. North (now under Google) also did not give any reason for abandoning its flagship product.</p><p>North hasn’t provided any information on the reasons for abandoning the product. <strong>However, the company had mentioned that Focals 1.0 would be dropped after Google acquires it</strong>. “We’re proud to have grown our company in the Kitchener-Waterloo region and are thankful for the tremendous support we’ve received from the community. We are looking forward to remaining in the region with Google. We are winding down Focals 1.0 and we will not be shipping Focals 2.0, but we hope you will continue the journey with us as we start this next chapter,” North’s co-founders had said when announcing the Google takeover.</p><p>Many will argue that the North got a fresh lease of life, better funding and research facilities from Google but the question is whether Google was ethical in killing off a rival smart glass?</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p><span><span>Ted Han, our amazing software developer, has been working hard to combine a data-driven “back end” with ease of use for the people who are testing and, we hope, will ultimately be deploying this tool in their news flow. Several key features are available now with many more to come.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Partner newsrooms — including several in the McClatchy media group’s central-U.S. region and Uruguay’s largest publisher —&nbsp; have been putting Correx, our web-based software, through its paces. We’re getting excellent feedback, and see great potential.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the beginning, we’ve envisioned Correx as a key way to help news organizations improve transparency and more fully engage with their communities. Straightforward corrections of mistakes are a vital kind of transparency, and can boost trust.</span></p>
<p><span>Because so much of what journalists publish reaches people via social media, we designed Correx to help journalists a) know better who’s sharing their work; b) easily correct/update widely shared stories; and c) communicate efficiently with sharers to encourage them to re-share the corrections and updates.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://newscollab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Correx-User-Guide.pdf">We’ve created a “users guide” of an early Correx version</a>. It explains how the tool works. In this post, we want to show how several news organizations have put it into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><em><strong>Kansas City Star</strong></em></h3>
<p><span>Last month, McClatchy’s </span><i><span>Kansas City Star</span></i><span> became the first newsroom to use Correx. In one of its first tests, it updated a coronavirus article, a topic that demands frequent updates given the fast-moving nature of this crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/kcstar/status/1268632225219776518">original tweet</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kansas City area has 3rd consecutive day of triple-digit rise in new COVID-19 cases <a href="https://t.co/FMrPCsrUDZ">https://t.co/FMrPCsrUDZ</a></p>
<p>— The Kansas City Star (@KCStar) <a href="https://twitter.com/KCStar/status/1268632225219776518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://newscollab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-2.10.37-PM-1024x991.png" width="323" height="312" alt=""><span><span>One of the people who shared the story was @BluebirdsofMO. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BluebirdsofMO/status/1268918965679656960">The tweet</a><span> had five comments, 17 retweets and 15 likes.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Several days later, an editor at the Star used Correx to find out who had shared the original story. The editor then, also using Correx, posted an update along with replies to some of the sharers with significant followings. </span></p>
<p><span>(Notice, in the update, the “Correx” link next to the time and date; Twitter tells you what software was used to post individual tweets.)</span></p>
<p><span>Needless to say, the most gratifying part of the exercise for the Star newsroom people was the reply thanking the organization for its “outstanding journalism” — an assessment with which we agree.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Eric Nelson, McClatchy’s Central regions grown editor, has been our primary contact at the Star since the project began. We asked him how it’s going from their perspective. His reply:</span></p>
<p><i><span>The testing of the corrections tool with the ASU News Co/Lab has been incredibly valuable on a couple of fronts. Of course, we always are aiming to be as transparent as possible with our audience, and this new corrections tool puts us in a better position to communicate with digital users when sources have changes in a story or something needs to be addressed immediately.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>But it also has provided us with a great weapon in this fast-moving news cycle with COVID-19 and the landscape of protests. We are able to reconnect with our engaged audience and give them immediate updates on each developing story as it happens.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Readers have been very appreciative of our communication with the tool and have even thanked us for the updates and our work. That is incredibly rewarding.</span></i></p>
<h3><span></span></h3>

<h3><em><strong>El País</strong></em></h3>
<p><span>Uruguay’s largest news organization is headed by Martín Aguirre, who spent an academic year at ASU as part of the State Department-sponsored Humphrey Fellowships (part of the Fulbright program that brings foreign scholars and professionals to the U.S. each year). </span></p>
<p><span>He and his social media editor, Matías Rocha, saw the potential in the Correx tool during a video call last month, and they immediately put it to use in their own work.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the&nbsp;<span>El País correction.</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">Corrección: Aduanas aclara que no hay cambios en el régimen de compras al exterior por Internet. Este artículo ha sido actualizado con nueva información <a href="https://t.co/htazIxpjFx">https://t.co/htazIxpjFx</a></p>
<p>— EL PAÍS (@elpaisuy) <a href="https://twitter.com/elpaisuy/status/1279198046677536777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Rocha posted a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/matiasrocha_/status/1279207021653393410"><span>Twitter thread</span></a><span> explaining the newsroom’s use of Correx:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">En <a href="https://twitter.com/elpaisuy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elpaisuy</a> estamos probando una herramienta en Twitter que permite el tracking de quienes comparten nuestros artículos. ¿Para qué? 🤔</p>
<p>— Matías Rocha (@matiasrocha_) <a href="https://twitter.com/matiasrocha_/status/1279207021653393410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span>If you look at the thread you’ll see that several people replied with praise for the news organization. The news organization’s use of Correx, Rocha tells me, “generated surprise among many and positive comments from people who normally don’t have a positive opinion of us or our work.” (Of course, he added, there were negative comments from people who don’t like anything </span><i>El País </i><span>does.)</span></span> <span>We’re looking forward to watching how McClatchy and El País, and other newsrooms that are becoming testers, use Correx. We’re getting feedback on how we can improve it to make their work more efficient — our list of bugs to squash and features to add is both daunting and exciting.&nbsp;</span> <span>If your newsroom is interested in testing Correx, let us know. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, some historical background to provide some context. (Meta: There is a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip to it.)</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I’ve been an independent/freelance software developer/engineer/consultant/whatchamacallit for 10+ years. All thoughout, I recorded my business activities in an accounting software package (an ancient version of Quickbooks). I did a couple of units in accounting in my undergraduate years so I understood the fundamentals of accounting (assets/liabilities/equity/debit/credit etc.) and the value of having proper financial records. It was easy to do and made sense to me.</p>

<p>In addition to providing software services and consulting to clients, I also dabbled in creating my own startups. Some had moderate success. Some bombed out completely. Nevertheless, I’ve been trying to do ‘bootstrapped’ businesses for quite a while (though maybe it wasn’t known by that term back then).</p>

<p>Then, about 5-6 years ago, an old client of mine asked me to join his new startup. He was very persuasive. So I did.</p>

<p>However, since I was in Australia and the startup company was in California, it was just easier to have a client/consultant relationship than to be an employee. Legally employing me would mean the company would have to incorporate a subsidiary in Australia and all the ensuing hassle that involved.</p>

<p>Nah, too much trouble.</p>

<p>I remained, technically and legally, a consultant/contractor although, for those five years, I worked exclusively for the startup and no one else. But since I was an independent contractor, I had to keep my own books.</p>

<p>And so, I continued to use my accounting software package (which I’m now going to abbreviate to <strong>ASP</strong>) to record the business activities that I did for my ‘boss’. Which was just as well because I still have some recurring revenue from an old SaaS of mine. Those need to be booked as well.</p>

<p>All through the last 10+ years, the ASP been served me well. It’s not perfect, but it was good enough. Quite good for the $80 (ish? It was on special, I think) that I paid for it at the time. However, it was getting quite dated and the license would eventually expire. (I actually have it running in a non-Internet-accessible Windows XP virtual machine. That’s how old it is.)</p>

<p>One day, I was going to have to replace it, or otherwise do something about it, but not yet.</p>

<p>Then, in 2020, the coronavirus/covid-19 pandemic happened. The company I was working for lost funding and folded.</p>

<p>Well …</p>

<p>That was enjoyable: Having a regular a job for 5+ years. And I was getting used to it. What now?</p>

<p>Five years for a tech startup is … tiring (I didn’t expect it to last as long as it did). I didn’t want to rush into looking for another job straightaway. I wanted to take some time off.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of weeks catching-up/reading-up/revising the startup literature. Inevitably, I got drawn back into the ‘bootstrapped business’ game again.</p>

<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>As the wisdom goes, the way to come up with startup ideas is to ‘notice’ a problem that you have (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not “think up” but “notice.” At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences “organic” startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the couple of weeks, I tried to ‘go zen’ and notice things. In particular, I tried to notice things which are problems but which my mind would normally just dismiss as ‘that’s just how things are’.</p>

<p>It was a fun time and a challenging exercise to temporarily rewire my brain to look at the world differently. I noticed some things. I brainstormed some ideas. Some were wacky. Most were terrible.</p>

<p>And then I noticed my ancient accounting software package. It’s a problem that’s existed for many years but had always been pushed back as ‘Not now’.</p>

<p>I was surprised. Very. This problem had been dormant for many years. I had just never noticed it before.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more. The software is fine but it needs replacing. Could I create a replacement? How much work would it be? Would anyone else want it? Would they pay for it? I’ve been using it for 10+ years but I only use a small fraction (5%?) of its functionality. Could I improve it by omitting the other 95%? Lots and lots of questions.</p>

<p>It prompted me to do some research around the Internet and I noticed the following: All the major accounting software vendors have gone online/SaaS. SaaS is great for the vendor but, in the case of accounting, it’s terrible for the user. Think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Business-critical accounting data is stored in the cloud where it’s all controlled by the vendor.</strong> Essentially, the major vendors are forcing small businesses to give up control and then holding the data hostage in return for ongoing SaaS subscription fees. (And it looks like the vendors are getting away with it.)</p>

<p>No way was I, as a user, gonna go with that.</p>

<p>If I was inclined to purchase a replacement for my ASP, I would have trouble finding a suitable one that wasn’t SaaS. I don’t want my business-critical data to be in the cloud. I want it to be in a file on my computer. Furthermore, I don’t want to pay $10-$20 every month to do what, 10 years ago, an $80 product could do for another 10+ years. Think about it: $10-$20 per month vs a $80 one-off fee. It’s a ridiculous comparison.</p>

<h2 id="niche">Niche</h2>

<p>So, here, I think, there is a gap in the market. Small and micro-businesses which would otherwise purchase an entry-level ASP are not being well served by the SaaS offerings which are available. (I’m not talking about large businesses which spend much more on accounting software, irrespective of whether it’s SaaS or not. Those are fine.)</p>

<p>So … do I want to go after this market segment?</p>

<p>I’d like to … but I’m not.</p>

<p>Um, why not?</p>

<p>Because I’m just one person. I don’t have the resources/time/funding to go for that.</p>

<p>And anyway, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14046313-start-small-stay-small-a-developer-s-guide-to-launching-a-startup">respected</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/book/StartSmallStaySmall">sources</a> recommend starting out as niche as possible (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of targeting the entire market segment, I’m going to go for a niche.</p>

<p>What’s the niche? Well, basically, the niche is … ‘me’ :)</p>

<p>Or rather, the niche would be the characteristics which describe me as a user. So it’d be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solo operator. No employees. No stock. Not a corporation.</li>
  <li>Manage own accounting data. Don’t need an accountant.</li>
  <li>Control over own data. Non-SaaS.</li>
  <li>… and maybe some other stuff that hasn’t manifested yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having used my ASP for 10+ years, I know exactly the feature set that I use. I don’t think I’m anyone special so there should be other people in a situation like mine. In theory, my feature set should be a good match for them too.</p>

<p>So I’ve found, or rather, noticed, a problem and a niche. And the way I’ve defined it, it’s small enough that I can aim a “bootstrapped startup” at it.</p>

<p>Do I wanna go for it?</p>

<p>Yeah, let’s give this a shot and see how things turn out.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-conclusion">TL;DR (conclusion)</h2>

<p>This is why I started GigoBooks: I have an itch to scratch. The itch has been around for <em>several years</em> before I eventually noticed it. It points me to (I think) a market niche which is underserved. I’m going to scratch my itch, and also, create something to serve the niche better. The ‘something’ is a more suitable, more affordable, non-SaaS accounting software.</p>

<![CDATA[Fixing MacBook Pro Thermal Performance Issues]]>

August 2, 2020 | https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/fixing-macbook-pro-thermal-performance-issues/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/fixing-macbook-pro-thermal-performance-issues/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        

<p>Over the past several months, my 2018 15” MacBook Pro developed thermal
performance issues. Here's what I did to fix the problem. The two key changes
were that I switched to using the right side <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)#Thunderbolt_3">Thunderbolt
3</a> ports
instead of the left side ones, and I cleaned the dust buildup in the internal
fans.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#the-problem"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The problem first started when I noticed my CPU usage spiking to near 100%. In
the process list, I saw <code>kernel_task</code> taking up most of the CPU.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359">learned</a> that macOS does this
intentionally to prevent the CPU from overheating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the functions of kernel_task is to help manage CPU temperature by
making the CPU less available to processes that are using it intensely. In
other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become
too hot, even if your Mac doesn't feel hot to you. It does not itself cause
those conditions. When the CPU temperature decreases, kernel_task
automatically reduces its activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fan-speed">Fan Speed<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#fan-speed"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>For many years, I've used
<a href="https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl">smcFanControl</a> to manually increase
my fan speed because I don't mind fan noise, especially if it means getting
better performance out of my laptop or being able to comfortably put it on my
lap.</p>
<p>However, it stopped working reliably after a macOS update. I purchased <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat
Menus</a>, which comes with a well supported
fan control feature. Note that you have to buy it from their own website to get
fan control. The Mac App Store version <a href="https://bjango.com/help/istatmenus6/macappstore/">doesn't include that particular
feature</a> for some reason.</p>
<p>I turned the fans up to max regularly in an attempt to preempt the <code>kernel_task</code>
issue, but it still kept popping up.</p>
<h2 id="thunderbolt-3-ports">Thunderbolt 3 Ports<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#thunderbolt-3-ports"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/363933/275342">this excellent StackExchange
answer</a> that recommends using
the right side Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of the left side ones. Apparently the
ports aren't equal. The left ones can cause thermal issues. Also, using both
ports on either side can be problematic.</p>
<p>I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CalDigit-TS3-Plus-Thunderbolt-Dock/dp/B07CZPV8DF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=223U28DX1402C&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=caldigit+ts3+plus&amp;qid=1595940705&amp;sprefix=caldigit+,aps,223&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=016d783904cae8cac9d952a3c58d816b&amp;language=en_US">Thunderbolt 3
dock</a>
for a single cable solution that handles charging and all my peripherals,
including monitors. I tended to plug it into a left port. I switched it over to
a right port and saw an immediate difference in temperature. iStat Menus reports
the temperatures from various sensors.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2oiPxjF.png" alt="iStat Menus temperature readings"></p>
<p>I tested and verified that using a left port caused the CPU temperature to go up
much higher than using a right port.</p>
<p>For a few months, this simple change was enough to resolve the issue. Luckily, I
was able to continue using a single cable, and I didn't have to plug in my dock
on one side and then a separate charger on the other side.</p>
<h2 id="resolution-scaling">Resolution Scaling<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#resolution-scaling"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>Then the problem started happening again. I also experienced issues playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_Simulator">Tabletop Simulator</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive">Counter-Strike</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant">Valorant</a> (on Windows through Boot
Camp), all games that my machine should be able to handle without any problems.
It would stuttter even after I turned the resolution and graphical settings all
the way down.</p>
<p>I thought it might have something to do with my monitors. In my desk setup, I
have two external monitors that I run at a scaled resolution that looks like
2560 x 1440.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPz7nXG.png" alt="external display resolution"></p>
<p>Note the warning that “Using a scaled resolution may affect performance.” The
problem is that macOS <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1043">achieves this
resolution</a> by rendering
everything in double the size and then scaling it down. So my MacBook is
essentially doing the rendering work for two 5K monitors.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0oroxGb.png" alt="System Information displays"></p>
<p>See <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/4k-monitor-at-1440p-scaling-performance.2232164/">this
thread</a>
or <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/338581/275342">this StackExchange answer</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>I considered turning the resolution down to look like 1920 x 1080, which isn't a
scaled resolution, but then everything looked too big.</p>
<p>I was pretty frustrated at this point, especially because
<a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> video calls started freezing up on me. I got into the
habit of unplugging my monitors before joining video calls.</p>
<h2 id="dust">Dust<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#dust"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>This entire time, I thought the problem was my MacBook producing too much heat.
Beyond making the fans run at max more often, I never considered that the
problem could be that it stopped being able to get rid of heat.</p>
<p>Then I read <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/cleaning-macbook-after-16800-hours-of-use/">this
post</a>
from someone who cleaned the inside of a MacBook after 7 years of use. I was
initially skeptical that clogged fans were my problem because my MacBook was
only about a year and a half old. But the more I thought about it, the more it
made sense, and I didn't have anything to lose by trying to clean it.</p>
<p>To open my MacBook, I followed <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Touch+Bar+2018+Lower+Case+Replacement/121426">this iFixit
guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="autoboot">AutoBoot<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#autoboot"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>I learned that by default, macOS turns on the MacBook when you press any button
(not just the power button) or open the lid. This was very surprising to me. I
did recall being confused in the past when my MacBook turned on even though I
didn't press the power button. When it first happened, I thought there was
something wrong. At least from Apple's perspective, it turns out <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature/">this is a
feature, not a bug</a>.</p>
<p>So to make sure the MacBook stays off through the process, you have to run this
in a terminal to turn off booting on lid open.</p>
<p>To turn the setting back on later, run this. Though I just left mine off after I
was done.</p>
<h3 id="removing-the-bottom">Removing the Bottom<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#removing-the-bottom"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>The next step was to take off the screws. Apple uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_security_screw">pentalobe
screws</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FQndl8j.jpg" alt="pentalobe screw"></p>
<p>I've opened MacBooks before to replace <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spicypillows">swollen
batteries</a>, so I was prepared with an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072HNBL9Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=09c787c5245a192a816fd263da8ad7ea&amp;language=en_US">electronics screwdriver
set</a>
that includes pentalobe bits.  I also had a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endust-Electronics-Compressed-bitterant-11407/dp/B00HX7VZ5M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=endust+duster&amp;qid=1596317241&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=4bb9cd9f61cc6a4a158ec8dfbfb00e3d&amp;language=en_US">can of compressed
air</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWhg3vL.jpg" alt="screwdriver and duster"></p>
<p>I removed the screws and learned that Apple has made the bottom harder to open
because now you need a suction cup. I repurposed the suction cup from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GKXPL6M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=a201bd337a2a7814cff67674269ea94f&amp;language=en_US">car
dash cell phone
holder</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ewlAsGh.jpg" alt="cell phone holder with suction cup"></p>
<p>You have to use the suction cup to lift part of the bottom enough to slide in
something to release a few internal latches. I used a library card.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDEaslF.jpg" alt="lifting the bottom cover"></p>
<h3 id="cleaning-the-dust">Cleaning the Dust<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#cleaning-the-dust"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>Once I got my MacBook open, it was obvious that dust was the main cause of my
performance issues. Just taking the bottom off caused a cloud of dust to come
out.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CN5oz3j.jpg" alt="dust on the bottom cover"></p>
<p>There was also cat hair from this troublemaker.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Feill8c.jpg" alt="my cat"></p>
<p>Both fans were totally gunked up.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IAGcS0j.jpg" alt="dust on the inside"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BF8Sinf.jpg" alt="dust on the left fan"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gX2FxJ5.jpg" alt="dust on the right fan"></p>
<p>I used compressed air to blow out the dust. I also used a toothpick to get some
off the fans that wouldn't come off from blowing alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BxW6OOp.jpg" alt="overview after cleaning"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OMmeXnG.jpg" alt="left fan after cleaning"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E60RF3J.jpg" alt="fan closeup after cleaning"></p>
<p>I put the cover back on and haven't had any more thermal performance issues.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#retrospective"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>It would be nice if macOS could provide some actionable advice when
<code>kernel_task</code> is trying to stop the MacBook from overheating. I would have
appreciated an OS suggestion to use the right side Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>
<p>But I also never considered that my laptop fans could require cleaning. In
retrospect, that's foolish because I've seen how dirty it can get in desktop
PCs, and I know that heat is an inhibitor to computer performance. It's just
like running in humid weather. Your body starts shutting down because its main
mechanism for getting rid of heat (sweating) stops working because humidity
prevents sweat from evaporating.</p>
<p>It would be cool if the machine could detect and alert when the fans are no
longer effective, perhaps with a sensor that looks for a lack of airflow at the
vents.</p>
<p>To prevent the issue from occurring again, I've set up a recurring task in
<a href="https://todoist.com/r/danny_guo_xlyrub">Todoist</a> to remind me to clean my
computers once a year.</p>

August 2, 2020 | http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Error handling in Rust is very different if you’re coming from other languages. In languages like Java, JS, Python etc, you usually <code>throw</code> exceptions and <code>return</code> successful values. In Rust, you return something called a <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type is an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enum</a> that has two variants - <code>Ok(T)</code> for successful value or <code>Err(E)</code> for error value:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>T<span>,</span> E<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>T<span>)</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Err</span><span>(</span>E<span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Returning errors instead of throwing them is a paradigm shift in error handling. If you’re new to Rust, there will be some friction initially as it requires you to reason about errors in a different way.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll go through some common error handling patterns so you gradually become familiar with how things are done in Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the error</li>
<li>Terminate the program</li>
<li>Use a fallback value</li>
<li>Bubble up the error</li>
<li>Bubble up multiple errors</li>
<li>Match boxed errors</li>
<li>Libraries vs Applications</li>
<li>Create custom errors</li>
<li>Bubble up custom errors</li>
<li>Match custom errors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Ignore-the-error"><a href="#Ignore-the-error" title="Ignore the error"></a>Ignore the error</h2><p>Let’s start with the simplest scenario where we just ignore the error. This sounds careless but has a couple of legitimate use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re prototyping our code and don’t want to spend time on error handling.</li>
<li>We’re confident that the error won’t occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say that we’re reading a file which we’re pretty sure would be present:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>fs<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> content <span>=</span> fs<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"./Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> content<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Even though we know that the file would be present, the compiler has no way of knowing that. So we use <code>unwrap</code> to tell the compiler to trust us and return the value inside. If the <code>read_to_string</code> function returns an <code>Ok()</code> value, <code>unwrap</code> will get the contents of <code>Ok</code> and assign it to the <code>content</code> variable. If it returns an error, it will “panic”. Panic either terminates the program or exits the current thread.</p>
<p>Note that <code>unwrap</code> is used in quite a lot of Rust examples to skip error handling. This is mostly done for convenience and shouldn’t be used in real code as it is.</p>
<h2 id="Terminate-the-program"><a href="#Terminate-the-program" title="Terminate the program"></a>Terminate the program</h2><p>Some errors cannot be handled or recovered from. In these cases, it’s better to <em>fail fast</em> by terminating the program.</p>
<p>Let’s use the same example as above - we’re reading a file which we’re sure to be present. Let’s imagine that, for this program, that file is absolutely important without which it won’t work properly. If for some reason, this file is absent, it’s better to terminate the program.</p>
<p>We can use <code>unwrap</code> as before or use <code>expect</code> - it’s same as <code>unwrap</code> but lets us add extra error message.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>fs<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> content <span>=</span> fs<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"./Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Can't read Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> content<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>panic!</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Use-a-fallback-value"><a href="#Use-a-fallback-value" title="Use a fallback value"></a>Use a fallback value</h2><p>In some cases, you can handle the error by falling back to a default value.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we’re writing a server and the port it listens to can be configured using an environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, accessing that value would result in an error. But we can easily handle that by falling back to a default value.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>env<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> port <span>=</span> env<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>"PORT"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap_or</span><span>(</span><span>"3000"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> port<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we’ve used a variation of <code>unwrap</code> called <code>unwrap_or</code> which lets us supply default values.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or_else" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>unwrap_or_else</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or_default" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>unwrap_or_default</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Bubble-up-the-error"><a href="#Bubble-up-the-error" title="Bubble up the error"></a>Bubble up the error</h2><p>When you don’t have enough context to handle the error, you can bubble up (propagate) the error to the caller function.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived example which uses a webservice to get the current year:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>collections<span>:</span><span>:</span>HashMap<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>Error<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> body <span>=</span> response<span>.</span>json<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>&lt;</span>HashMap<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> i32<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> date <span>=</span> json<span>[</span><span>"years"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two function calls inside the <code>get_current_date</code> function (<code>get</code> and <code>json</code>) that return <code>Result</code> values. Since <code>get_current_date</code> doesn’t have context of what to do when they return errors, it uses pattern matching to propagate the errors to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Using pattern matching to handle multiple or nested errors can make your code “noisy”. Instead, we can rewrite the above code using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>?</code> operator</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>collections<span>:</span><span>:</span>HashMap<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"We've time travelled to {}!!"</span><span>,</span> date<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>"Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}"</span><span>,</span> e<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>Error<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>"https://postman-echo.com/time/object"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> res <span>=</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>blocking<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span>?<span>.</span>json<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>&lt;</span>HashMap<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> i32<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>?<span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> date <span>=</span> res<span>[</span><span>"years"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This looks much cleaner!</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator is similar to <code>unwrap</code> but instead of panicking, it propagates the error to the calling function. One thing to keep in mind is that we can use the <code>?</code> operator only for functions that return a <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="Bubble-up-multiple-errors"><a href="#Bubble-up-multiple-errors" title="Bubble up multiple errors"></a>Bubble up multiple errors</h2><p>In the previous example, the <code>get</code> and <code>json</code> functions return a <code>reqwest::Error</code> error which we’ve propagated using the <code>?</code> operator. But what if we’ve another function call that returned a different error value?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the previous example by returning a formatted date instead of the year:</p>
<pre><code><span>+ use chrono::NaiveDate;</span>
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
      Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),
    }
  }

  fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;
<span>-   let date = res["years"].to_string();</span>
<span>+   let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);</span>
<span>+   let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;</span>
<span>+   let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();</span>

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>The above code won’t compile as <code>parse_from_str</code> returns a <code>chrono::format::ParseError</code> error and not <code>reqwest::Error</code>.</p>
<p>We can fix this by <code>Box</code>ing the errors:</p>
<pre><code>  use chrono::NaiveDate;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
      Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),
    }
  }

<span>- fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {</span>
<span>+ fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {</span>
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;

    let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);
    let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;
    let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Returning a trait object <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code> is very convenient when we want to return multiple errors!</p>

<h2 id="Match-boxed-errors"><a href="#Match-boxed-errors" title="Match boxed errors"></a>Match boxed errors</h2><p>So far, we’ve only printed the errors in the <code>main</code> function but not handled them. If we want to handle and recover from boxed errors, we need to “downcast” them:</p>
<pre><code>  use chrono::NaiveDate;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
<span>-     Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),</span>
<span>+     Err(e) =&gt; {</span>
<span>+       eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :(");</span>
<span>+       if let Some(err) = e.downcast_ref::&lt;reqwest::Error&gt;() {</span>
<span>+         eprintln!("Request Error: {}", err)</span>
<span>+       } else if let Some(err) = e.downcast_ref::&lt;chrono::format::ParseError&gt;() {</span>
<span>+         eprintln!("Parse Error: {}", err)</span>
<span>+       }</span>
<span>+     }</span>
    }
  }

  fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;

    let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);
    let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;
    let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Notice how we need to be aware of the implementation details (different errors inside) of <code>get_current_date</code> to be able to downcast them inside <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.downcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>downcast</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.downcast_mut" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>downcast_mut</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Applications-vs-Libraries"><a href="#Applications-vs-Libraries" title="Applications vs Libraries"></a>Applications vs Libraries</h2><p>As mentioned previously, the downside to boxed errors is that if we want to handle the underlying errors, we need to be aware of the implementation details. When we return something as <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code>, the concrete type information is erased. To handle the different errors in different ways, we need to downcast them to concrete types and this casting can fail at runtime.</p>
<p>However, saying something is a “downside” is not very useful without context. A good rule of thumb is to question whether the code you’re writing is an “application” or a “library”:</p>
<h3 id="Application"><a href="#Application" title="Application"></a>Application</h3><ul>
<li>The code you’re writing would be used by end users.</li>
<li>Most errors generated by application code won’t be handled but instead logged or reported to the user.</li>
<li>It’s okay to use boxed errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Library"><a href="#Library" title="Library"></a>Library</h3><ul>
<li>The code you’re writing would be consumed by other code. A “library” can be open source crates, internal libraries etc</li>
<li>Errors are part of your library’s API, so your consumers know what errors to expect and recover from.</li>
<li>Errors from your library are often handled by your consumers so they need to be structured and easy to perform <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/2018-edition/ch06-02-match.html#matches-are-exhaustive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustive match</a> on.</li>
<li>If you return boxed errors, then …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of this year I decided I'd had enough.</p>
<p>I've been writing software and making games since my early teens and for most of my life I've worked on side projects. Some of them made a little money. Others grew a large following. Quite a few failed miserably.</p>
<p>My last project was an open source game development library called <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong></a>. Relative to my previous projects, this project felt very successful. Many hundreds of people starred it on Github. Loads of people joined the Discord chat and it even has it's own tag on Stack Overflow. To this day, people are still using it to make their games.</p>
<p>I always assumed that one day I'd be able to turn it into some side income and maybe eventually replace my full-time job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I always felt like something wasn't quite working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried my very best to help indie game developers make their games. In the beginning the project really resonated with people. Lots of contributors joined to add new features and a community formed around it quite quickly. This felt amazing.</p>
<p>However, this little side project took 5 years of my life. It's the longest amount of time I'd ever spent on anything outside my marriage and kids.</p>
<p>And what did I have to show for it? A bit of pocket money and a whole lot of support requests. As the project got bigger, it put more strain on my limited free time. Eventually it broke me.</p>
<p>Compare that to a game I'd previously published that only took 3 weeks to create and made roughly the same amount of monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Then around Christmas I was talking to my dad about his recent retirement. This conversation got me thinking a lot about what I want to do with the next 10 to 20 years of my life. Where do I want to be when I retire?</p>
<p>That's when I decided it was time to do something else.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson-i-learned-about-failure">The Lesson I Learned about Failure</h2>
<p>After taking some time to reflect on all of my previous projects I realized that failure comes in many forms and some are better than others.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with failure. Not every project works out the way you want and that's okay.</p>
<p>For example, some of my previous projects didn't have <em>market fit</em>. When I launched them into the world, nobody really cared. Luckily when this happens early in the project it's not a big deal. Either discard the idea and move on or figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Another project I started didn't have <em>founder fit</em>. In other words, I initially got excited about the idea and it looked great on paper but over time I really didn't want to work on it anymore.</p>
<p>But the worst kind of failure I've experienced is <em>failure disguised as success</em>. The mistake I made was not recognizing failure early enough. Surprisingly, this was an easy trap to fall into because when it looks like things are working, it feels like just a little more effort will bring everything together.</p>
<p>Unforutnately, more effort applied in the wrong place makes it worse. When the project was small it was easy to manage and I enjoyed working on it everyday. At the time it seemed like a good idea to keep adding more features and watch as more people started using it. But the downside of adding more features is that it becomes increasingly time intensive to fix bugs, update demos, deal with pull requests and respond to questions.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't doing it all for free. I knew at some point I needed to start generating income to be able to dedicate more time to the project. So I launched a Patreon page and immediately had a few people support me finanically. This positive feedback fueled my desire to keep going. Only now, I had another job, creating content to reward my patrons.</p>
<p>I never figured out how to make it work and it was suprisingly difficult to let go.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-was-the-best-thing-i-ever-did">Quitting Was the Best Thing I Ever Did</h2>
<p>Eventually I decided to stop working on <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> and handed the project over to someone else.</p>
<p>At first, this was a really hard decision. It felt like I was throwing away thousands of hours of work and letting down the community around it. But really, it was just a bad case of <strong>sunk cost fallacy.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sunk cost fallacy is when people continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now firmly believe this was the right choice. The project is still alive and being actively worked on by long time contibutors that use it. Having a new set of eyes on the code base has breathed new life into it.</p>
<p>What I got out of it was a wealth of experience, a chance to reflect and really think about what I wanted to do next.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-am-i-going-to-do-next">So, What Am I Going To Do Next?</h2>
<p>I recently discovered a whole new world of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">indie hackers</a> creating profitable side projects in their spare time. It's an amazing feeling to find a community of like minded people doing what I've always wanted to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've finally found my people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, before I started spending all my time on MonoGame.Extended I built and launched several products. Sometimes they where games and other times it was an app or tool to solve my own problems.</p>
<p>My goal is to get back to my roots. Only this time I've got more experience under my belt. I've learned a lot about building an audience, finding a market, and launching great products.</p>
<p>There's still a mountain of work ahead but I'm excited to be starting the next phase of my journey.</p>
<p>Succeed or fail I'll be writing about it here. If you'd like to see what happens next I'd love to have you on the mailing list below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>June, 2017: my partner Eve and I are stuck at the visa-on-arrival desk in the domestic transfer wing of Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa. The rest of the transfer passengers, all Ethiopian, are waltzing past us to form a monster queue at passport control. As soon as I get my precious stamp, I sprint off to hold our place before more passengers sneak in front of us.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Eve finds me, groggy from our redeye and nonplussed about navigating the Ethiopian visa desk on her own. “Why did you have to run off like that?!” Somehow, “so that we could wait at the departure gate instead of in the passport control line” doesn’t seem like a very good reason.</p><p>It was at this moment that I realized I was an unreasonably impatient person.</p><p>(In retrospect, I probably should have been tipped off by my compulsion of doing a mental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method" target="_blank">critical path analysis</a> on any everyday activity taking more than 15 seconds, but I just thought that was normal until I started dating people and noticed they often did things in a sub-optimal order.)</p><hr><p>Now that I’ve confessed to the sin of impatience, I’m going to spend the rest of this post trying to convince you that it’s actually a good thing.</p><p>(The good part is the habit of frequently asking yourself “how could this thing take less calendar time.” I don’t recommend manifesting it in annoying ways like ditching your partner in an Ethiopian airport.)</p><p>Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.</p><p>Obviously, lots of these are non-causal correlations. Still, the sheer number of different datapoints is a surprising convergence:</p><h3 id="e-mail">E-mail</h3><p>It seems trivial, but lots of different people have observed that being slow to respond to emails is a bad sign, or that famous people whom you’d expect to be swamped respond surprisingly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1214278840358359040" target="_blank">Sriram Krishnan</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>the most famous, interesting, powerful people all read their own email</p></li><li><p>they’re almost universally good at responding to it quickly</p></li><li><p>they’re always very, very curious.</p></li><li><p>they have very little time. Anything with friction gets done “later”</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-invest-in-startups" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to change. Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails.</p></blockquote><h3 id="startups">Startups</h3><p>It’s become common wisdom that launching (and iterating) quickly is a major factor behind whether startups succeed.</p><p><a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec02/" target="_blank">Sam Altman again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[Y]ou have to be decisive. Indecisiveness is a startup killer. Mediocre founders spend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision. They’re talking about you know I could do this thing, or I could do that other thing, and they’re going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need is this bias towards action.</p><p>The best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly. But they get things done really quickly. Every time you talk to the best founders they’ve gotten new things done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best predicts a success of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they’ve gotten new things done, that’s the best predictor we have that a company will be successful.</p></blockquote><p>This propagates even down to the level of how quickly you deploy software changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1130569945891258369" target="_blank">Nick Schrock</a> on Facebook / Instagram moving fast and breaking things:</p><blockquote><p>Instagram was even faster operationally than Facebook. They had continuous deployment. Any engineer could deploy at any time (they would run a command called “Yolout” lol). Facebook was on weekly deploys at the time on the web and way slower on mobile.</p><p>IG story definitely lends credibility to the those-who-ship-faster-win argument</p><p>…Worth noting that Facebook learned from this. As the company grew, the release cadence got faster. First daily, then twice daily, and it is now continuous. It’s a remarkable achievement by the release engineering team.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not just Facebook; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/" target="_blank"><em>Accelerate</em> found a strong correlation between deploy frequency and performance</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To summarize, in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high performers have:</p><ul><li><p>46 times more frequent code deployments</p></li><li><p>440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</p></li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="appstools">Apps/tools</h3><p>The “speed matters a lot” principle applies even to things that are already very fast. Google has found that <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters" target="_blank">users <em>dramatically</em> prefer faster webpages</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.</p></li><li><p>DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.</p></li></ul><p>…</p><ul><li>When AutoAnything reduced page load time by half, they saw a boost of 12-13% in sales.</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters" target="_blank">James Somers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Google famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast, you’re more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuff, get feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to lose the impulse to find something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/" target="_blank">Nelson Elhage put it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>What is perhaps less apparent is that <em>having faster tools changes how users use a tool or perform a task.</em> Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways. I’ve seen this phenomenon clearly while working on both Sorbet and Livegrep…</p><p>Many individual tests at Stripe would take 10-20s or more…. Because we succeeded at building Sorbet so that it could typecheck the entire codebase in that time window, it became the fastest way many developers could get decent feedback on their code, to check for basic typos, misused APIs, and other low-hanging classes of errors. Since it was their fastest option, we saw users reaching for Sorbet as their first line of checking their code fairly early on in our development and rollout. Getting even mediocre feedback and some confidence fast was much more important than anything that would take minutes.</p><p>Watching users use livegrep, I’ve seen a related upside from its performance…. Because livegrep is so fast, users use it <em>interactively</em> in a way I’ve rarely seen people interact with other search engines: they enter an initial query, and then, if they get too many or too few results, they edit it based on the result list, which gets a new set of results, which they continue to refine or expand until they hit on the results they are seeking.</p></blockquote><h3 id="personal-workflow">Personal workflow</h3><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/" target="_blank">Steve Yegge via Jeff Atwood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I was trying to figure out which is the most important computer science course a CS student could ever take, and eventually realized it’s Typing 101.</p><p>The really great engineers I know, the ones who build great things, they can type.</p></blockquote><p>This matches my experience at Wave, where the best engineers are disproportionately likely to type quickly, know their keyboard shortcuts, and have invested a lot of time making their common tasks efficient.</p><p>Obviously, those aren’t the main things that make them good engineers—but I think they help in more than just the obvious ways.</p><h3 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h3><p>At Wave, when hiring, we’ve noticed that moving someone through the hiring process faster makes them <em>much</em> more likely to accept our offer. If we take a long time to get back to them or schedule the next steps, it both gives them more time to lose interest, and makes it seem like we’re not excited about them. Not a good look!</p><p>This is apparently common trope in sales as well—<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1204077/time-kills-deals" target="_blank">“time kills all deals”</a>.</p><p>Paul Graham on <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">how the founders of Stripe got time on their side</a>:</p><blockquote><p>At YC we use the term “Collison installation” for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask “Will you try our beta?” and if the answer is yes, they say “Great, we’ll send you a link.” But the Collison brothers weren’t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they’d say “Right then, give me your laptop” and set them up on the spot.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://avc.com/2018/08/strike-when-the-iron-is-hot/" target="_blank">Fred Wilson</a> on the same effect in networking:</p><blockquote><p>That night when I got home I told the Gotham Gal “I met Danny Meyer today and he gave me his card and said I could call him whenever I need a table.” To which she replied “go there for lunch tomorrow.” And I told her “I don’t have a lunch tomorrow.” She said “Get one. He will remember who you are tomorrow but won’t next month.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="combat">Combat</h3><p>One of the most influential military strategy writers, John Boyd, is most famous for the idea of the “OODA loop:” that human action is an iterated process of <em>observing</em> the world, <em>orienting</em> within it, <em>deciding</em> how to respond and finally <em>acting</em> on the decision. Boyd’s claim was that <em>going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are competing against.</p></blockquote><p>As a recent example, for instance, many states and countries <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/macovid/">waited far too long</a> to lock down when the COVID epidemic hit because <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/09/plot-economics/" target="_blank">the virus got inside their OODA loop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Right now, the perception of agency at all levels is falling. Individuals, corporations, governments, heads of state, stock traders, the UN, <em>everybody</em> feels they’re losing the plot, but they don’t see anybody else <em>finding</em> it…. As far …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When I was still a kid, I was always so excited to sit in the front passenger seat on holiday trips. You see, there were no navigation devices yet, and thus we had a physical roadmap. My dad frequently knew the route from memory, but I was eager to follow along on the map (and point out when we could find a quicker or alternative route).</p><p>My excitement for maps has not gone away. It's not coincidental that I'm currently writing about roadmaps in another, similar, sense—product roadmaps.</p><p>In general, the power of a map is to help you get to a destination. But how we create and use product roadmaps is essential. <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-you-should-look-at-everything-as-a-process">It is a process</a> that is both creative and analytical.</p><p>In this series, I aim to guide you through everything you need to know about creating the ultimate product roadmap. In this first installment, I aim to explain what a product roadmap is and why it's such a great tool.</p><h2>What is the purpose of a product roadmap?</h2><p>Let me first tell you what I feel is a good definition of a Product Roadmap, which will help us frame the rest of the points in this guide.</p><blockquote><em>"A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering." - </em><a href="https://www.productplan.com/"><em>ProductPlan</em></a></blockquote><p>We're going to break down the definition step by step, so we understand what it entails.</p><h3><strong>"high-level"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means we don't go into the details of a product vision too much (that's what backlogs are for). We need the roadmap to stay on a strategic level where we can use it to set the course over the long term. To illustrate: think about a ship sailing to some destination. A captain on the vessel needs to look out over the horizon for direction. In contrast, an engineer on the same boat takes care of the machines in the engine room: both necessary for the end goal, but very different levels of focus.</p><h3><strong>"visual"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the product roadmap, like a land roadmap, can be understood without needing to read it (apart from titles, notes, names, etc.). Visual representation helps make the roadmap easier and quicker to understand, which is necessary to get buy-in from everyone involved.</p><h3><strong>"summary"</strong>‍</h3><p>This is similar in the "high-level" part we saw earlier. (Not focus on all the details.) But it does drive home the point that the roadmap should simplify, but definitely not leave out critical parts of the vision. Doing this is hard, especially when a product is big. Note, summarizing is a continuous process.</p><h3><strong>"vision"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the "why" of a product. Why create the product in the first place? What goal does it have? What is the value proposition for users? What is the incentive for the business to create this product? Tip, don't spend a lot of time creating a product roadmap before your vision is crystal clear.</p><h3><strong>"direction"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the execution part of getting to a finished product. It is "how" you go from nothing to providing the value intended. Do I need to say this is important? Well, yes, it is; it is essential. In the execution plan, you find most detail (and struggles) while creating and updating the product roadmap. After you formed a product vision (<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-product-market-fit-is-not-enough">hopefully in line with your customers and your company!</a>), most stakeholders don't sway from that idea. The route to that goal, however, is a bumpy and complicated road. (I'm almost getting ahead of myself in wanting to talk more about this here, but there will be multiple sections where we'll get into the details of this!)</p><h3><strong>"product offering"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means "what" you'll eventually end up creating—the finished product. The whole reason you create a product roadmap is to offer a valuable product to the end-user, your customer.</p><p><em>An interesting aside. Maybe you're already familiar with the last three parts from the definition (vision, direction, and product offering) but under different wording. </em><a href="https://simonsinek.com/"><em>Simon Sinek</em></a><em> talks about the "why, how, and what" (vision, direction, and product offering, respectively). He calls it the "Golden Circle" by his book with the same name.</em></p><h2>What does a product roadmap look like?</h2><p>A product roadmap can take many forms, feature-based, goal-based, time based, release-based, and a few more. But good roadmaps have a few things in common.</p><ul role="list"><li>They are timed based (be it specific dates or timelines).</li><li>They have more detail for near term (higher priority) items than for later (lower priority) items.</li><li>They have 'themes' as the highest level (like "increase customer retention for yearly subscribers"), not features.</li></ul><p><strong>Here's an example of a roadmap (</strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/"><strong>source</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><figure id="w-node-47cfe779986d-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5f233514485d617b4cac9b6e_homepage-slider-1-1.png" alt="Roadmap example from roadmunk"></p></figure><p>In the next article, I will walk you through the details of an example product roadmap. As well as listing the different types of product roadmaps that are possible to make. First I'll tell you a bit more about how you can use your roadmap.</p><h2>How can you use a product roadmap?</h2><p>Ok, so now you know what a product roadmap is supposed to do and what it looks like. Right? Well, on a high level, yes. But the utilization of a product roadmap becomes even more evident in the specific cases you use it.</p><p>These are all about people, social dynamics, collaboration, and communication. You can use a product roadmap</p><ol role="list"><li>as a reference document for the (Scrum )team.</li><li>to get stakeholder alignment.</li><li>to provide options for planning and conversation.</li><li>to prevent someone from 'hijacking' your sprints.</li><li>to tell a story to your customers.</li></ol><p>These five uses all come down to the most important reason for creating a product roadmap. To set the narrative of your product vision and execution.</p><blockquote><em>A Product Roadmap is a narrative tool.</em></blockquote><p>With a product roadmap you can tell a story of intent. The intent to build a product towards a certain goal. This narrative is essential to get others to work with you in creating great products.</p><p><em>There is one crucial point I want to drive home. A product roadmap is a living document. The things you plan are not set in stone. The product you're building is undergoing iteration upon iteration. Thus your roadmap should reflect the latest findings and details, especially in the age of Agile and Lean (software) development.</em></p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully, you're now familiar with the idea of what a product roadmap is, why you should use one, and what it looks like.</p><p>If you have any questions, thoughts, or feel something is missing, please do shoot me a message on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/askjibran">Twitter</a>.</p><p>By the way, I also created a checklist with "<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist">40 Product Roadmap tips</a>." So if you can't wait to get into creating and using a product roadmap, I highly recommend you check it out.</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>When I launched Feature Upvote, my B2B SaaS, in 2017, the price was $29/month, with a 20% discount for paying yearly. I chose that price  arbitrarily, but also because it is what I felt I would pay for a similar service.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/14/you-can-probably-stand-to-charge-more/">hearing repeatedly that developers who start businesses need to charge more</a>, I wanted to experiment with a small increase.</p>
<p>I delayed doing this until I had enough new customers each month to really be sure of the price change’s effect.</p>
<p>In January 2019 I put the price up to $35/month, a 20% increase.</p>
<p>Why such a small increase? I knew in theory that I should charge significantly more, but in practice I wasn’t confident about it. I am, after all, still a developer <img src="https://sjc3.discourse-cdn.com/business6/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate stayed roughly the same. That is, the same number of new customers per month, but each paying more.</p>
<p>Nobody complained. Ever. Not a single person questioned the change in our pricing.</p>
<p>A year later, in January 2020 I got bolder. I put the price up to $49/month, a 40% increase.</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate initially dropped a little but not much. It might have just been statistical noise, or the post-Christmas lull.</p>
<p>I was  getting fewer new customers, but they were paying more. Pricing experts say that customers who pay more tend to remain customers longer, resulting in a much higher customer life time value, so this seemed okay.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic started and we were all in shock and sales stalled for a little while. So it was really hard to tell the true effect of the price increase.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, I’m signing up more new customers than ever, at the conversion rate we had before the price increase.</p>
<p>As with the first price change, nobody complained. Ever.</p>
<h2>What about existing customers?</h2>
<p>I’ve never put up prices for existing customers. I’m okay with people getting the price they started with indefinitely. It is the way I’d want to be treated as a customer. Anyway, within a couple of years, as existing customers churn, the “problem” of older customers paying less will simply go away.</p>
<h2>Has the customer base changed?</h2>
<p>Yes. As the price goes up we tend to get larger organisations as customers. Unfortunately, they are also more likely to ask for custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits. In all cases, I say no. That may change in the future.</p>
<h2>What did I tell existing customers about the price change?</h2>
<p>Nothing. I probably should have, but it fell off my to-do list.</p>
<p>To make sure existing trial customers weren’t shown one price and charged another, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>December 2019: change the prices listed on our pricing page, but still charge new customers the old pricing.</li>
<li>January 2020: start actually charging the new prices.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other pricing plans</h2>
<p>I have bootstrapper pricing at $19/month (with a 20% discount when paying yearly). I’ve had this pricing since the very start, and never changed it. It is an easy way to answer would-be customers who write “I want to use Feature Upvote, but it is too expensive for me.”</p>
<p>For charities or non-profits who ask, we have a plan that’s 25% cheaper. Almost no-one asks for this plan. I don’t know why, because it is featured on our pricing page.</p>
<p>Just about any Open Source project that asks can use us for free. There are a couple of stipulations, but I tend not to check too carefully.</p>
<h2>Do I charge enough?</h2>
<p>I don’t know. I’m content with the pricing now, and have no plans to change it in the near future. Next year I might add a much more expensive enterprise plan, for those people who ask about custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits.</p>

		<p>When it comes to recruitment interviews, there's an overwhelmingly popular opinion (on the Internet) that one should test candidates in conditions that do resemble <strong>real-life work scenarios</strong> as much as possible. Tasks &amp; challenges should mimic the ones that the candidate would face in her/his daily work. Everything else (<em>"how many golf balls would fit into Opel Corsa?"</em>) is the subject of laughter and mockery.</p><p>I dare to disagree. My interviews are nothing like real work (but TBH we have a final stage of a "trial day" within the actual team, mainly to check <em>the chemistry</em> between a potential new-joiner and the team members and to give her/him a chance to verify what we've said about the company).</p><p>A recruitment interview is a freaking intense experience. We have a strictly limited time - we can't build full context to get someone up-to-speed with the product details, local specifics, whole workflow, etc. Of course, we can try easy, shallow, "mundane" scenario, but let's face the truth - we need to evaluate candidate's capability to tackle TRULY demanding stuff (most likely <strong>10% of the actual work</strong> (s)he'll perform - but that part truly makes the difference).</p><p>The purpose of the interview is not to emulate work 1:1, but to answer certain questions: about particular personality traits, attitude, aptitude, mindset. Technical skills can always be taught later - if someone has a matching motivation, proper engineering foundation, is bright enough and has an ability of structured abstract thinking.</p><p>That's why my interviews are aimed to check how does the individual think (instead of verifying her/his memorization skills). How does (s)he approach problems, split them, classify them, explore possible solutions? When does (s)he abandon the path that doesn't look promising anymore? Is (s)he able to effectively share her/his thoughts (verbally, graphically, in code)? What about focus - does (s)he navigate in terms of a given goal or roam chaotically around? And in the end ... <strong>is (s)he actually having fun</strong> (when solving challenging problems)?</p><p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do ask abstract questions as well. The problems candidates are facing at my interviews usually have NOTHING in common with the company's domain, BUT they have a super-low entry level (e.g. they are about common problems everyone encounters every day): building up the context takes seconds (literally), so the candidate can focus on tackling the problem, not understanding its basics. They also share one another characteristic: they are picked to be <strong>unique, intriguing and memorable</strong> - so regardless of the outcome (whether the candidate joins us or not), our interview remains an interesting experience in her/his memory.</p><p>There are ones who are surprised and do criticize such a form of the interview. They usually ask whether these exercises truly represent the everyday problems of this organization. Some even get irritated (very few) - but no-one has asked to stop the interview prematurely.</p><p>Honestly, I don't mind. These days candidates get very picky - they have so many offers available in the market, that the less gritty ones don't even want to participate in the interview that exposes them to the challenges out of their comfort zone (e.g. which is - syntactical language problems or knowing the specifics of the framework). It's their right, but it also means they are definitely <strong>not the people I'm looking for</strong>.</p><hr><p>P.S. Of course, sometimes (rarely) I look for a high level of expertise within a specific technological niche - that requires a different assessment and it's a completely separate topic.</p>

Over the same period of time they have created a wide range of computer vision and data analysis tools which have the potential to change forms of policing and incarceration in many places around the world. These innovations, however, have come at the cost of what U.S. lawmakers describe as “</span><a href="https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/EMBARGOED_CECC%202019%20Annual%20Report.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">crimes against humanity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.”</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Technology’s Double-Edged Sword</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The global COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that Chinese technology companies are at the cutting edge of surveillance innovation and predictive analytics. In April 2020, Amazon, the wealthiest technology company in the world, received a shipment of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-cameras/exclusive-amazon-turns-to-chinese-firm-on-u-s-blacklist-to-meet-thermal-camera-needs-idUSKBN22B1AL"><span data-contrast="none">1,500 heat-sensing camera systems</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;from the Chinese surveillance company&nbsp;Dahua. Many of these cameras, which are worth approximately $10 million, will be installed in Amazon warehouses to monitor the heat signatures of employees and alert managers if workers exhibit COVID-19-like symptoms. Other cameras included in the shipment will be distributed to IBM and Chrysler, among other buyers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2017,&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;received over $900 million to build comprehensive surveillance systems which supported a “re-education” system of extra-legal internment, checkpoints, and ideological training for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/xinjiang-dahua-hikvision"><span data-contrast="none">Muslim populations in northwestern China</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed it on a list of companies banned from buying or selling in the United States. Yet despite the legal and ethical ramifications of buying products from&nbsp;Dahua, Amazon continues to do business with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the help of&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;and hundreds of other private and public Chinese companies, as many as 1.5 million Uighurs and Kazakhs have been “disappeared” into a widespread system of “re-education camps” in the Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).[1]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Nearly all Uighurs and Kazakhs in China have an immediate family member who is, or has been, interned in this camp system. Uighurs now refer to themselves as a “</span><a href="https://livingotherwise.com/2018/07/31/happiest-muslims-world-coping-happiness/"><span data-contrast="none">people destroyed</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.” As I observed during a research trip to the region in 2018, many Uighur-owned businesses have closed across the country. Whole streets have been abandoned in Uighur towns and villages. Because of the re-education system, it is likely that within a single generation Muslim embodied practice and Turkic languages in Northwest China will cease to provide essential ways for Uighurs and Kazakhs to sustain their knowledge systems.[2]&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">This process affects every aspect of their lives not only due to mass detentions, but also because of the way biometric and data surveillance systems supporting the camps have been used to monitor and transform their behavior.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[3]</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This terrain assessment describes how Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang were targeted by digital and biometric surveillance technologies of the “re-education” system. Its main conclusion is that the world is witnessing the birth of a new form of technology-enabled systems of social and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">behavioral control.

    <p>I recently got to use a very curious Haskell technique
<span>

<span>]</span>

 time traveling. I say this with
the utmost seriousness. This technique worked like
magic for the problem I was trying to solve, and so
I thought I’d share what I learned. In addition
to the technique and its workings, I will also explain how
time traveling can be misused, yielding computations that
never terminate.</p>
<h3 id="time-traveling">Time Traveling</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I read <a href="https://kcsongor.github.io/time-travel-in-haskell-for-dummies/">this post</a> by Csongor Kiss about time traveling in Haskell. It’s
really cool, and makes a lot of sense if you have wrapped your head around
lazy evaluation. I’m going to present my take on it here, but please check out
Csongor’s original post if you are interested.</p>
<p>Say that you have a list of integers, like <code>[3,2,6]</code>. Next, suppose that
you want to find the maximum value in the list. You can implement such
behavior quite simply with pattern matching:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>myMax</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"Being total sucks"</span>
<span>myMax</span> (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> max x <span>$</span> myMax xs
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could even get fancy with a <code>fold</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>myMax</span> <span>=</span> foldr1 max
</code></pre></div>
<p>All is well, and this is rather elementary Haskell. But now let’s look at
something that Csongor calls the <code>repMax</code> problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you had a list, and you wanted to replace all the elements of the
list with the largest element, by only passing the list once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we possibly do this in one pass? First, we need to find the maximum
element, and only then can we have something to replace the other numbers
with! It turns out, though, that we can just expect to have the future
value, and all will be well. Csongor provides the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>repMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Int</span>, [<span>Int</span>])
<span>repMax</span> <span>[]</span> rep <span>=</span> (rep, <span>[]</span>)
<span>repMax</span> [x] rep <span>=</span> (x, [rep])
<span>repMax</span> (l <span>:</span> ls) rep <span>=</span> (m', rep <span>:</span> ls')
  <span>where</span> (m, ls') <span>=</span> repMax ls rep
        m' <span>=</span> max m l
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, <code>repMax</code> takes the list of integers,
each of which it must replace with their maximum element.
It also takes <strong>as an argument</strong> the maximum element,
as if it had already been computed. It does, however,
still compute the intermediate maximum element,
in the form of <code>m'</code>. Otherwise, where would the future
value even come from?</p>
<p>Thus far, nothing too magical has happened. It’s a little
strange to expect the result of the computation to be
given to us; it just looks like wishful
thinking. The real magic happens in Csongor’s <code>doRepMax</code>
function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>doRepMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>doRepMax</span> xs <span>=</span> xs'
  <span>where</span> (largest, xs') <span>=</span> repMax xs largest
</code></pre></div>
<p>Look, in particular, on the line with the <code>where</code> clause.
We see that <code>repMax</code> returns the maximum element of the
list, <code>largest</code>, and the resulting list <code>xs'</code> consisting
only of <code>largest</code> repeated as many times as <code>xs</code> had elements.
But what’s curious is the call to <code>repMax</code> itself. It takes
as input <code>xs</code>, the list we’re supposed to process… and
<code>largest</code>, the value that <em>it itself returns</em>.</p>
<p>This works because Haskell’s evaluation model is, effectively,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_reduction">lazy graph reduction</a>. That is,
you can think of Haskell as manipulating your code as
<span>
<label for="tree-note">a syntax tree,</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

Why is it called graph reduction, you may be wondering, if the runtime is
manipulating syntax trees? To save on work, if a program refers to the
same value twice, Haskell has both of those references point to the
exact same graph. This violates the tree's property of having only one path
from the root to any node, and makes our program a DAG (at least). Graph nodes that
refer to themselves (which are also possible in the model) also violate the properties of a
a DAG, and thus, in general, we are working with graphs.

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 performing
substitutions and simplifications as necessary until it reaches a final answer.
What the lazy part means is that parts of the syntax tree that are not yet
needed to compute the final answer can exist, unsimplified, in the tree.
Why don’t we draw a few graphs to get familiar with the idea?</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-graphs-and-their-reduction">Visualizing Graphs and Their Reduction</h3>
<p>Let’s start with something that doesn’t have anything fancy. We can
take a look at the graph of the expression:</p>

<p>Stripping away Haskell’s syntax sugar for lists, we can write this expression as:</p>

<p>Then, recalling that <code>(:)</code>, or ‘cons’, is just a binary function, we rewrite:</p>

<p>We’re now ready to draw the graph; in this case, it’s pretty much identical
to the syntax tree of the last form of our expression:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/length_1.png" alt="The initial graph of length [1]."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>length [1]</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this image, the <code>@</code> nodes represent function application. The
root node is an application of the function <code>length</code> to the graph that
represents the list <code>[1]</code>. The list itself is represented using two
application nodes: <code>(:)</code> takes two arguments, the head and tail of the
list, and function applications in Haskell are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried</a>. Eventually,
in the process of evaluation, the body of <code>length</code> will be reached,
and leave us with the following graph:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/length_2.png" alt="The graph of length [1] after the body of length is expanded."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>length [1]</code> after the body of <code>length</code> is expanded.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Conceptually, we only took one reduction step, and thus, we haven’t yet gotten
to evaluating the recursive call to <code>length</code>. Since <code>(+)</code>
is also a binary function, <code>1+length xs</code> is represented in this
new graph as two applications of <code>(+)</code>, first to <code>1</code>, and then
to <code>length []</code>.</p>
<p>But what is that box at the root? This box <em>used to be</em> the root of the
first graph, which was an application node. However, it is now a
an <em>indirection</em>. Conceptually, reducing
this indirection amounts to reducing the graph
it points to. But why have we <span>
<label for="altered-note">altered the graph</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

This is a key aspect of implementing functional languages.
The language itself may be pure, while the runtime
can be, and usually is, impure and stateful. After all,
computers are impure and stateful, too!

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 in this manner? Because Haskell is a pure language,
of course! If we know that a particular graph reduces to some value,
there’s no reason to reduce it again. However, as we will
soon see, it may be <em>used</em> again, so we want to preserve its value.
Thus, when we’re done reducing a graph, we replace its root node with
an indirection that points to its result.</p>
<p>When can a graph be used more than once? Well, how about this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>let</span> x <span>=</span> square <span>5</span> <span>in</span> x <span>+</span> x
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the initial graph looks as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/square_1.png" alt="The initial graph of let x = square 5 in x + x."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>let x = square 5 in x + x</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, this <em>is</em> a graph, but not a tree! Since both
variables <code>x</code> refer to the same expression, <code>square 5</code>, they
are represented by the same subgraph. Then, when we evaluate <code>square 5</code>
for the first time, and replace its root node with an indirection,
we end up with the following:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/square_2.png" alt="The graph of let x = square 5 in x + x after square 5 is reduced."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>let x = square 5 in x + x</code> after <code>square 5</code> is reduced.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two <code>25</code>s in the graph, and no more <code>square</code>s! We only
had to evaluate <code>square 5</code> exactly once, even though <code>(+)</code>
will use it twice (once for the left argument, and once for the right).</p>
<p>Our graphs can also include cycles.
A simple, perhaps <em>the most</em> simple example of this in practice is Haskell’s
<code>fix</code> function. It computes a function’s fixed point,
<span>
<label for="fixpoint-note">and can be used to write recursive functions.</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

In fact, in the lambda calculus, <code>fix</code> is pretty much <em>the only</em>
way to write recursive functions. In the untyped lambda calculus, it can
be written as: <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda f . (\lambda x . f (x \ x)) \  (\lambda x . f (x \ x))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
In the simply typed lambda calculus, it cannot be written in any way, and
needs to be added as an extension, typically written as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">fix</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{fix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>

It’s implemented as follows:</p>

<p>See how the definition of <code>x</code> refers to itself? This is what
it looks like in graph form:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/fixpoint_1.png" alt="The initial graph of let x = f x in x."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>let x = f x in x</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it’s useful to take a look at how this graph is processed. Let’s
pick <code>f = (1:)</code>. That is, <code>f</code> is a function that takes a list,
and prepends <code>1</code> to it. Then, after constructing the graph of <code>f x</code>,
we end up with the following:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/fixpoint_2.png" alt="The graph of fix (1:) after it&amp;rsquo;s been reduced."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>fix (1:)</code> after it’s been reduced.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see the body of <code>f</code>, which is the application of <code>(:)</code> first to the
constant <code>1</code>, and then to <code>f</code>'s argument (<code>x</code>, in this case). As
before, once we evaluated <code>f x</code>, we replaced the application with
an indirection; in the image, this indirection is the top box. But the
argument, <code>x</code>, is itself an indirection which points to the root of <code>f x</code>,
thereby creating a cycle in our graph. Traversing this graph looks like
traversing an infinite list of <code>1</code>s.</p>
<p>Almost there! A node can refer to itself, and, when evaluated, it
is replaced with its own value. Thus, a node can effectively reference
its own value! The last piece of the puzzle is how a node can access
<em>parts</em> of its own value: recall that <code>doRepMax</code> calls <code>repMax</code>
with only <code>largest</code>, while <code>repMax</code> returns <code>(largest, xs')</code>.
I have to admit, I don’t know the internals of GHC, but I suspect
this is done by translating the code into something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>doRepMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>doRepMax</span> xs <span>=</span> snd t
  <span>where</span> t <span>=</span> repMax xs (fst t)
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="detailed-example-reducing-dorepmax">Detailed Example: Reducing <code>doRepMax</code>
</h4>
<p>If the above examples haven’t elucidated how <code>doRepMax</code> works,
stick around in this section and we will go through it step-by-step.
This is a rather long and detailed example, so feel free to skip
this section to read more about actually using time traveling.</p>
<p>If you’re sticking around, why don’t we watch how the graph of <code>doRepMax [1, 2]</code> unfolds.
This example will be more complex than the ones we’ve seen
so far; to avoid overwhelming ourselves with notation,
let’s adopt a different convention of writing functions. Instead
of using application nodes <code>@</code>, let’s draw an application of a
function <code>f</code> to arguments <code>x1</code> through <code>xn</code> as a subgraph with root <code>f</code>
and children <code>x</code>s. The below figure demonstrates what I mean:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/notation.png" alt="The new visual notation used in this section."> <figcaption>
            <p>The new visual notation used in this section.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s write the initial graph for <code>doRepMax [1,2]</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/repmax_1.png" alt="The initial graph of doRepMax [1,2]."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>doRepMax [1,2]</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Other than our new notation, there’s nothing too surprising here.
The first step of our hypothetical reduction would replace the application of <code>doRepMax</code> with its
body, and create our graph’s first cycle. At a high level, all we want is the second …</p></div></div>

<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

                    <p>Back in the old days when information was scarce and limited, it made sense to blame all project management challenges on people management skills.</p><p>Here are 5 common challenges you might have come across across multiple articles:</p><ul><li>Not having a clear goal</li><li>Having unrealistic deadlines and expectations</li><li>Not creating accountability</li><li>Miscommunication</li><li>Lack of engagement with stakeholders</li></ul><p>However, a lot of teams are able to get past these challenges today thanks to the internet.

The pain of not being able to collaborate cross functionally because the tool is too rigid and you’ll have to setup multiple configurations. The pain of getting teams to learn new terminologies. The pain of not being able to make sense of all the changes your team makes and how it all affects the macro-level picture.</p><p>They are clearly in a lot of pain. And the solution to it isn’t about assigning tasks and setting due dates. Let me explain why by expanding each of these challenges.</p><h3 id="1-aligning-everyone-on-a-common-big-picture-goal"><strong>1. Aligning everyone on a common, big picture goal</strong></h3><p>A lot of teams use a project management tool that makes them fill out a form which keeps those user stories and tickets in isolation.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Having your user stories and tasks sit in isolation makes it exponentially harder to make your team care about what they’re building or understand why they’re building it.

Learning new terminologies</strong></h3><p>Let’s be honest…</p><p>The first time you tried to learn agile and its methodologies you scratched your hair wondering what on earth an epic meant.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What if if your team could become agile without having to spend time learning the terminologies or the tool? Wouldn't that be great?</p><h3 id="3-unable-to-collaborate-cross-functionally"><strong>3. Unable to collaborate cross-functionally</strong></h3><p>It isn’t enough to just ship new features today.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Surely you can’t be switching between multiple tools for each team!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6

</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>

<h3 id="network-stack-tuning">Network stack tuning</h3>
<p>For low latency networking I don’t recommend using the Linux kernel networking
stack. Instead I recommend using kernel bypass technologies such as
<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a>, <a href="https://www.openonload.org/">OpenOnload</a>,
<a href="https://www.mellanox.com/products/software/accelerator-software/vma?mtag=vma">Mellanox VMA</a>
or <a href="https://exablaze.com/">Exablaze</a>. If you are using the kernel networking
stack there are several options you can use to tune it for low latency. I
suggest reading the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-networking-configuration_tools">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide</a>
and the blog post
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/">“How to achieve low latency with 10Gbps Ethernet”</a>
to learn about these options.</p>
<h3 id="disable-swap">Disable swap</h3>
<p>Accessing anonymous memory that has been swapped out to disk will incur a major
page fault. You can prevent this by disabling swap:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">swapoff -a
</code></pre><p>Your application will still incur major page faults when accessing <em>file backed
memory mappings</em> …</p></div></div>

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Protocol Buffer, also known as Protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It has been widely used in many applications, such as TensorFlow and <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. We have actually been using it without being aware, thus it has become a black box to most of the users.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to give a short tutorial on how to use Protocol Buffer in C++.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Protobuf compiler and libraries could be installed via <code>apt</code> on Ubuntu. However, to use the latest version of protobuf, we install from source code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> /tmp
<span>$ </span>wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.8.0/protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>protobuf-3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I chose to install the <code>all</code> version so it would be a little bit slow. To accelerate the installation process., we take advantage of multi-threads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./configure
<span>$ </span>make <span>-j16</span>
<span>$ </span>make check <span>-j16</span> <span># Make sure the installation would not have problems</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ldconfig <span># Refresh shared library cache.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Protocol Buffer libraries would be installed to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> by default.</p>



<p>To verify protobuf has been installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>protoc <span>--version</span>
libprotoc 3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>To learn Protocol Buffer, the most intuitive way is to go to the Google Protocol Buffer official website and start its official tutorial. However, the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial">tutorials</a> on the Google protobuf website are still using programming standard Proto2 while the latest programming standard is Proto3 which was released in 2016. The official <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/examples">samples</a> are using Proto3 and CMake, however, its CMake is not standard and many of its macros were not documented on the official CMake website. Therefore, I re-implemented Google’s official Protobuf C++ example using Proto3 and CMake with the best practice in a way that users are most likely to run into.</p>



<p>The source code could be found on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/leimao/Protocol_Buffer_Examples">Protocol Buffer Examples</a>.</p>



<p>The protobuf <code>proto</code> file, C++ <code>cc</code> file, and CMake <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files should be self-explanatory since I have put a lot of comments in the code to make it human-readable and easy to understand.</p>

<h3 id="basic-protocol">Basic Protocol</h3>

<p>To summarize the basic protocol of programming using protobuf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the structure of the data in a <code>proto</code> file.</li>
  <li>Implement the C++ programs which serialize/de-serialize the structured data. The programs will use the header and source code files of the structured data generated by the protobuf compiler. Alternatively, the program will use the header file generated by the protobuf compiler and the static library of the structured data generated by the C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Write CMake compile system to generate the header and source code files of the structured data, static library of the structured data, and the executable files.</li>
</ol>

Across 15 interviews, the problem most consistently mentioned was the inability to set weekly goals eg. &nbsp;"Work out 4X per week". Other habit apps had the feature, and it aligned with our intuition. So we built it 🎉.</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/08/IMG_BE540AC0130B-1-1.png"><figcaption>Ah, problem solved.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Getting my head around the choice between sleeping and 'tickers'</h2>

	<p><small>August  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>If you have a program that wants to do something periodically, say
once every ten seconds, the obvious and simplest way is to just
sleep for ten seconds after each time you do the thing. For example:</p>


<blockquote><pre>while True:
  collect_device_stats()
  publish_device_stats()
  time.sleep(10)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some languages and libraries also offer an API that I've seen called
a 'ticker'; Go, for example, has <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker"><code>time.Ticker</code></a>. A ticker signals or invokes
you somehow every time interval, such as every ten seconds. With
a ticker, you could write the above (in Go) as something like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ticker := time.NewTicker(10*time.Second)
for {
  t := &lt;- ticker.C
  collect_device_stats(t)
  publish_device_stats(t)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The big difference between the two is that <strong>a ticker is indifferent
to how long it took you to do your work</strong>. If collecting and
publishing device stats takes two seconds, the sleep approach means
that you will do this once every twelve seconds (two seconds for
the work followed by ten seconds of sleeping). The ticker approach
will collect and publish once every ten seconds, because it signals
you every ten seconds even if it took you two seconds to collect
and publish device stats.</p>

<p>While this may make tickers sound great, this behavior has potential
downsides. Which one you want depends partly on what your reasons are
for sleeping or delaying. In particular, if you're sleeping to limit
the load your actions create, then a ticker may not be what you want,
precisely because it's indifferent to how long your work took. If your
work takes nine seconds and you sleep afterward for ten, you're keeping
things less than 50% busy. If your work takes nine seconds and you have
a ten second ticker, you're keeping things 90% busy; one second after
you finish your work the ticker will go off again and start it all over.</p>

<p>Tickers are great for things you want to happen every N seconds,
even if they take a bunch of time (or a variable amount of time).
Sleeping is great for things you want to happen no more often than
once every N seconds. However, the difference between the two only
matters if what you're doing does (or may) take an appreciable
amount of time compared to the tick (or sleep) interval; if it isn't
going to, you might as well use whichever API is more idiomatic and
convenient, although tickers will probably make things more regular
and precise.</p>

<p>(This set of thoughts was sparked by poking around in <a href="https://gitlab.com/shouptech/cyberpower_exporter">some Python
code</a> that used
the <code>sleep()</code> idiom and then thinking about how it would probably
use a ticker in Go. (Well, in Go it would have a better API for what
it's doing, but apart from that.))</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s start with some history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format with the purpose to replace JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>By Fabrice Bellard</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that BPG not only is way smaller than JPEG but also delivers a better quality. And that’s not all! It also supports animations!</p>
<p>And when I say animation, I actually say GIF-like movies with MP4 quality that are actually smaller than the mp4 it was built from.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example (I have not included a GIF example because the same quality size and frame rate means that the GIF will have exactly 33.8MB)</p>
<p>So let’s go:</p>
<p>
<video id="ambition-mp4" loop="">
<source src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/preview-ambition-no-audio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>mp4, 25fps, 927kb
</p>

<p>
<img id="ambition-bpg" alt="Ambition BPG" src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/ambition.bpg">
<br>bpg, 25fps, 518kb
</p>


<p>The movie is called <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Ambition</a> and you can view it on <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Findie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="spot-the-differences-">Spot the differences? :)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s none (the mp4 doesn’t include audio, and neither does the BPG.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animation support.</strong> You can have a GIF half the size of an MP4.</li>
<li><strong>Video inline play</strong> (but without sound). One of the biggest problems is that on Mobile Safari no video can be played inline. GIFs solve, and when we have GIFs that are 5% the size of the original, that’s epic!</li>
<li><strong>High compression ratio.</strong> Smaller than a JPG and even smaller than Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> with similar quality if not better.</li>
<li><strong>You can start using today</strong> with a Javascript decoder (gzipped size: 56 KB).</li>
<li><strong>And plenty other</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>GIFs today are not even GIFs anymore. With the release of Imgur’s <a href="https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/">gifv</a> the internet went nuts for nothing more than a mp4 that has autoplay, and if mp4’s are not supported, or autoplay is disabled (mobiles), they’re replaced with very low quality GIFs.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides?</h3>
<p>We got just a few…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decompiling time!</strong> - Current example is around 8-10s (the bigger the file, the slower the decompiling)… This would be easily solved if browsers would add native support.</li>
<li><strong>Main thread blocking</strong> while decompiling large files.</li>
<li><strong>No sound support</strong> (but who cares, this is image encoding, we’re not talking better video formats).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h3>
<p>Why not go ahead and promote it so that browsers actually support it. Or you can start using it today, it requires some CPU processing, but hey! We’re saving bandwidth! :D</p>
<p>For example there’s a feature request on the Bugzilla Tracker of Firefox - <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1111277">here</a></p>
<p>Or share this article if you liked it! :D</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post1.png"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post4.png"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post3.png"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post2.png"></p>  <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Jack Rhysider started <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"><i>Darknet Diaries</i></a>, he had a blog that got a few thousand hits per day, 3,000 Twitter followers, and a full-time job as a network security engineer. Now, nearly three years and over 70 episodes later, the podcast has been downloaded over 8 million times. The show, which tells “true stories of the dark side of the internet”—including disturbing tales of hacking, data breaches, and cybercrime— is now a full-time job&nbsp; and pays for a production team.</p><blockquote><p>“I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</p></blockquote><p>Rhysider is not only humble about his incredible success—he says you can grow a successful show, too. How? He breaks it down into three steps: Make an excellent show, grow your audience, and monetize it—in that order.</p><hr><p><b>Make an Amazing Show</b></p><p><span>Rhysider quickly realized that part of what made his show stand out was not just the stories he was telling, but the way he told them. “We all have different ways that we’ve grown up and the way we look at the world,” he explains. Owning that singularity was one key to Rhysider’s success.</span></p><p><span>When he launched the first four episodes in the fall of 2017, he didn’t see any other podcasters in the high-drama cybersecurity stories space. As soon as he launched, however, he recalls, “I found four shows that were doing the same thing,” which made him “furious” and nearly caused him to quit. “I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</span></p><p><span>But he quickly realized he was giving his listeners an experience no one else was offering. any cybersecurity stories were either being told “in very dry and technical ways” or they came out in discrete chunks as the stories unfolded in real time. In contrast, he waited “until the chips had fallen” to let listeners hear the entire story from start to finish in one compelling episode.</span></p><figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="295" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359">Image provided by Rhysider</figcaption></figure><p><span>Not only was he creating stories with a distinct, compelling arc, he was also very deliberate in his delivery, leaning heavily on other creators for inspiration. As the saying goes, “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”</span></p><p><span>“When I started podcasting I was stealing everything I could,” Rhysider says. He listened carefully to podcasters including Ira Glass, Malcolm Gladwell, and Aaron Mehnke. One of his signature sounds—making it sound like two people are talking, when there is only one—came directly from the true-crime podcast </span><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/"><i><span>Dirty John</span></i></a><span>. “They pan to the left and talked with a little filter, and then they pan to the right and talk with a different filter and it was the same narrator.” He remembers thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s so cool. I’m gonna try that.’</span></p><p><span>Podcasters weren’t his only creative influences. At one point, Rhysider sought to emulate the </span><i><span>Fight Club</span></i><span> narrator. “I realized he’s got insomnia, so I need to stay up till 3 am and then try to record the episode at 3 am,” he recalled.</span></p><p><span>Rhysider is adamant that a quality show depends on excellent storytelling—and that you can cultivate that skill. He recommends buying books on podcasting, taking courses, and focusing not just on the technology but the content itself. He says it’s not just “what mic to use, but how to tell a great story and how to be entertaining.”</span></p><p><span>With practice and plenty of study, Rhysider found his own groove: “By Episode 30 or so I had my own voice and my own style.” Clearly, it’s working. The show, which saw 800 downloads per episode in the first week, was rated among the</span> <a href="https://lists.pocketcasts.com/top-podcasts-2019"><span>top 25</span></a><span> podcasts of 2019 by Pocketcasts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Rhysider, “if you don’t make something great, you’re gonna lose your listeners, which means you have to get new listeners faster than you’re losing the listeners. And that’s difficult.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When you create a great show, you naturally gain what Rhysider calls “superfans,” people who are so excited about it, who want to share it with their friends and family. “They go into the office and they say, ‘You have to listen to this,’ or they tell their friend, ‘You have to listen to this,’ that’s number one,” he explains.</span></p><hr><p><b>Show Promotion to Grow Your Audience</b></p><p><span>Having spent four months toiling over the first four episodes, Rhysider knew he had something special and began promoting the show right away. He relied on traditional social media marketing strategies, creativity, and, when it came to Facebook, luck.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-369"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1332" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201332'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-369">Who is the real Jack Rhysider? Looks like he’s doing something to protect his identity from Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p><span>It turned out, Rhysider had a friend at Facebook “who had a budget to play with.” His friend ended up gifting him $4,000 worth of Facebook ads. In return, his friend experimented with running different types of ad campaigns and had access to the analytics data.</span></p><p><span>Despite not being a huge fan of social media, Rhysider felt his show couldn’t have experienced turbo-charged growth without it. He referred to it as “a magic megaphone that you should not squander.”</span></p><p><span>Rhysider, in fact, only joined Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn after launching </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>, in order to promote the show. Early on, he invested $500 on paid promotions with Instagram influencers, which he said helped him reach the 5,000 follower mark. From there, he focused on more organic growth on Instagram, continuing to post regularly and interacting with other accounts that were similar to his. He also used Reddit to help grow his audience.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, Rhysider has increased the show’s visibility by taking advantage of other types of networking opportunities. He’s given out </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span> stickers at the many conferences he’s spoken at, has been a guest on about 20 podcasts, and has successfully pitched his show to journalists who mentioned it in publications including </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/arts/podcasts-tech-science.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Vulture, and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/grenfell-dust-on-our-lips-darknet-diaries-tip-off-observer-radio-reviews"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p><hr><p><b>Monetize</b></p><p><span>With a top-notch show, a huge following, and a strategic approach to monetization, Rhysider has nailed the financial aspect of podcasting. Burnt out on his full-time job, he quit work six months after launching and was able to earn a full-time living six months after that, at the end of 2018. By the beginning of 2019, he had the means to hire additional producers, artists, sound designers, an editor, and a writer.</span></p><p><span>According to one of Rhysider’s </span><a href="https://lime.link/blog/4-methods-for-finding-sponsors-for-your-podcast/"><span>recent blog posts</span></a><span> on Lime Link, he has monetized through ads for the past two years and he’s been very intentional in his approach. Rather than using networks, which wanted to put more ads in his show than he was comfortable with, he uses AdvertiseCast, Megaphone MTM, and Affiliate Ads. “AdvertiseCast does fairly well filling up my ad slots, but because I’m hosted on Megaphone it’s just a matter of enabling MTM and if I have any unfilled ad slots, ads get automatically added in.” Although he said MTM “doesn’t pay very well,” he feels its simple set-up and low-maintenance make it worthwhile. “And if I want to throw in the occasional affiliate deal, then hey why not?” he says, adding,&nbsp; “I typically go for affiliate deals when the sponsor has one but isn’t interested in paying for ads, they just want to pay for results.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Regarding Rhysider’s three-pronged approach to building a successful podcast, he’s clear about one thing: No amount of social media promotion or attempts to monetize will work if you don’t have the foundation of a fantastic show that retains listeners. Beyond that, he hesitates to attribute </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>’ exponential growth to any one strategy. Rather, he likens his success to the effort it takes to complete a cross-country bicycle trip. “It’s like a flywheel that you keep pushing.”&nbsp;</span></p> </div></div>]]>
