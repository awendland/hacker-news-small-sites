      <p><img src="https://justanman.org/images/aol-instant-messenger-shuts-down.png" alt="AOL Instant Messenger ‘Running Man’ waving goodbye"></p>
<p>In the early 2000s social media sites like Facebook and Twitter weren’t commonplace yet. Even text messages, at ten cents each, were something to be rationed. For many teenagers the primary means of communication outside school was AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). So when it was announced in October that they were shutting down AIM after 20 years, I felt a wave of nostalgia for the messaging app of my youth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear when they would be pulling the plug for good, but a high school friend and I planned to be online for the occasion. Their website indicated that AIM would continue to work until the morning of December 15, 2017. Assuming this meant UTC time, that put it going offline sometime after 7:00 PM EST on the 14th.</p>
<p>I wondered: Could I be the last person to sign off? The last person to send a message? Would I have anything profound to say?</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>I decided to research famous last words. First stop: the Book of Revelation. Final chapter, final verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last words are for fools who haven’t said enough!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too cantankerous. And as a somewhat libertarian leaning person, I wasn’t going to let Karl Marx have the last word.</p>
<p>I’d figure out what to say later and in the meantime started reading about the technology behind AIM. I learned about OSCAR, the proprietary protocol used by AIM and ICQ. Parts of the protocol were documented by AOL in an official SDK. This is what made third-party AIM clients possible. I had used Gaim (now Pidgin) on Linux machines before and indeed, there was even BSFlite, an AIM client for the command line.</p>
<p>AOL’s desktop client no longer worked for me. They had already pulled the iOS app from the App Store. Ditto for Android. Fortunately browser sign on still worked. I was greeted by a familiar interface that supported new features like embedded media and SMS.</p>
<p>I sent a couple test messages from the browser to my phone. Monitoring outbound activity in the Chrome network panel revealed the structure of a request: a simple HTTP POST to a url, with what appeared to be a session ID in the query string and a message body. I tried to send a message using <code>curl</code> and it worked. As long as I was signed on in the browser the request was accepted.</p>
<p>There were several paths to automating this but given the time constraint, something quick and easy would probably suffice. All I had to do was keep sending messages until the server stopped responding.</p>
<p><strong>December 14, 2017: The final countdown</strong></p>
<p>It was almost midnight UTC time. It would be the 15th soon and I didn’t want to miss the shutdown, so I set up a Bash script to run the <code>curl</code> command at one second intervals. Every now and then I had to manually reauthenticate in the browser. It wasn’t elegant but it worked. Now I had to wait…</p>
<p>To pass time I searched Twitter for mentions of AIM’s last day. Plenty of people were reminiscing about their old screen names, but only a handful were actually signing on one last time. I added them to my buddy list and we talked for a bit. One lived in DC, one in Toledo. Another in somewhere Maryland. Two were engineers, one was a wrestling announcer! I made dinner and watched <em>The Office</em> while occasionally checking on the script.</p>
<p>It ran for another six hours until 1:21 AM EST. I witnessed the drama play out in HTTP status codes:</p>
<pre><code>200 OK
200 OK
200 OK
408 Request Timeout
408 Request Timeout
401 Unauthorized
</code></pre><p>And like that, AIM was gone. Requests to aim.com returned an Invalid URL status page. <code>curl</code> returned nothing but 401s.</p>
<p><strong>Epitaph</strong></p>
<p>I examined the script logs and found it – the last message sent on AIM. [1] It was timestamped Fri Dec 15 01:21:42 EST 2017. From me, to me. (I didn’t want to spam anyone.)</p>
<p>I had borrowed the words from Leonard Nimoy’s final tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🖖</p>

					<p><a href="https://blog.frizn.fr/linux-kernel/">Kernel Linux</a> &gt; <a href="https://blog.frizn.fr/linux-kernel/cve-2020-14381">The curious case of CVE-2020-14381</a></p>

                    <h3>The curious case of CVE-2020-14381</h3>                    
                    <p>Today is the one-year anniversary of this interesting kernel bug I worked
on last year with <a href="https://twitter.com/bluec0re" target="_blank">@bluec0re</a>,
and as it turns out I wrote something about it during one of these lockdown
weekends so I thought I'd release it. <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2015" target="_blank" title="CVE-2020-14381 get_futex_key use-after-free">The bug itself</a>
was discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/tehjh" target="_blank">Jann Horn</a>
of Project Zero. While I touch most of the elements required to exploit the
bug, I stay superficial here since the exploit itself is not particularly
exciting. What makes this bug interesting to me is its lifecycle, in particular
how unevenly the patch was applied to the various distributions. I also talk
briefly about hardware side-channels since it was the first time I had ever
used one.</p>

<p><strong>The bug</strong></p><p>It’s already well-described in the bug tracker, but here is another summary.
The <span>futex</span> syscall's main parameter is a userland address, and this address
may belong to a file-backed mapping. In that case, the futex key kernel object
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/kernel/futex.c#L707" target="_blank">held</a>
and <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/kernel/futex.c#L724" target="_blank">kept</a>
a reference to the inode object, but didn’t hold a reference to the file’s mountpoint.
If the mountpoint were to go away, its associated kernel structures would be
freed, but the inode wouldn’t. That’s an issue because the inode itself has
fields that point to some of these structures, such as its <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L641" target="_blank">super_block</a>
struct.</p>

<p>Further use of the inode by <span>futex</span> code paths may therefore trigger
use-after-frees. One particular code path highlighted by Jann in the bug happens
when the <span>futex</span> is destroyed: the last reference to the inode is released
and the inode needs to be freed. This is done in <span>iput</span> which then calls
<span>iput_final</span>. <span>iput_final</span> and its subcalls will then call inode
management functions stored in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1942" target="_blank">super_operations</a>
struct accessed <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/inode.c#L1533" target="_blank">from the super_block</a>
object. The first instance happens right at the beginning of <span>iput_final</span> with
a call to the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/inode.c#L1539" target="_blank">drop_inode</a>
function.</p>

<p>Exploiting this bug requires being able to:
</p><ul>
  <li>Successfully <span>umount</span> a mountpoint. A no-go a few years ago, but
  possible nowadays with the normalization of unprivileged user namespaces.
  It’s a good example that this feature was never a trivial security tradeoff
  (unprivileged sandboxes v. augmented kernel attack surface) which in turn
  makes it somewhat surprising that all mainstream distributions enabled them by default
  without much debate</li>
  <li>Survive the <span>op-&gt;drop_inode()</span> execution (non-SMEP or a KASLR bypass)</li>
  <li>Survive the <span>op-&gt;drop_inode</span> indirection just before that (non-SMAP
  or a stack/heap leak)</li>
  <li>Do everything in one call, because with an incorrect inode state, a corrupted
  super_block and some linked lists unlinks to do in the remainder of <span>iput_final</span>,
  it’s doubtful we can even get as far as the second <span>super_operations</span>
  function pointer call (<span>evict_inode</span>)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Exploitation</strong></p><p>The first exploitation pathway that comes to mind goes as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li>wait for the <span>super_block</span> to be freed. It’s done in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/super.c#L299" target="_blank">an RCU callback</a>
  so one way or another you need to wait for the end of the RCU grace period
  after <span>umount</span> returns, e.g. with <span>membarrier</span>. For a PoC, spraying
  allocs for the duration of the expedited grace period works well enough since
  the <span>super_block</span> slab, <span>kmalloc-2k</span>, is not super busy.</li>
  <li>overwrite the freed <span>super_block</span> via a dynamic heap allocation primitive
  (e.g. <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/net/socket.c#L2264" target="_blank">sendmsg ancillary data</a>).</li>
  <li>point <span>s_op</span> to an attacker-controlled buffer</li>
  <li>point <span>drop_inode</span> to a chain of gadgets that pivot the stack to
  either the <span>super_block</span> or <span>super_operations</span> bufffers (which
  are both necessarily in registers and almost fully controlled). Example of
  common gadgets that would work in this situation would be <span>push reg; jmp/call [reg+x]</span>
  that can then be chained with a <span>pop rsp; ret</span> gadget placed at <span>[reg+x]</span></li>
  <li>do whatever with your unconstrained ROP, fixup the stack and return</li>
</ul>


<p>This would be a sucky exploit to maintain as it relies on precise knowledge
of the kernel image, but that’s as good as it gets for a raw function pointer
execution without a read primitive in kernel space. The portability issues
for exploits like this are in themselves a significant bonus of SMEP: it rarely
prevents exploitation but makes many candidates much less appealing for weaponization.</p>

<p>We can take SMEP for granted. It’s only one CPU generation / 2 years older
than SMAP, but not having it is getting really rare. Plus if your exploit does
rely on no-SMEP but your target ends up having software SMEP enabled, which
you sometimes can't really tell at runtime, you've just turned a privesc attempt into
a lost foothold. No-SMAP however is still a thing for the time being. As a
random example the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/intel/" target="_blank" title="AWS EC2 intel CPUs">AWS EC2 CPU roster</a>
shows some CPUs that do not support SMAP.</p>

<p><strong>On infoleak bugs</strong></p><p>In any case, to exploit this bug one needs at least one infoleak. The most
important is to get kernel base for gadgets, and then we could use a heap leak
or similar to support SMAP-capable CPUs (to have our "attacker-controlled
buffer" in point 3 above in kernel space). A heap/stack leak can often yield
a .text address as well so having one would kill two birds with one stone.
But, not everyone has the right infoleak in their stash ready to go, contrary
to a common anti-KASLR argument. And even when you do have an infoleak bug,
it doesn't mean that it will help with your current exploit.</p>

<p>For instance, a good infoleak candidate which was released around the same
time last year would be the one with uninitialized memory in coredumps, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10732" target="_blank">CVE-2020-10732</a>.
But short of a public proof-of-concept, one needs to understand the coredump
generation code, then find an object in that slab that allows us to get
.text, and another one to deduce a heap address you control. In short, at least
as much work as the rest of the exploit we are looking at. And that's without
considering that using two bugs in one exploit also means that you need to
take into account both bugs limitations. Unprivileged user namespaces for the
main bug we are looking at (not a thing on e.g. RHEL 7), and for the coredump,
well the ability to retrieve the core files, i.e. not running in a container.
Luckily for our project, we already knew we were targeting non-SMAP containers
so we were able to avoid spending all that effort on an infoleak bug that
would have ended up being worthless; a luxury that real exploit developpers
preparing capabilities ahead of time do not have. But if we were targeting
SMAP containers, well that would have been it since more effort would have
exceeded our resource budget for this project.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware side-channels</strong></p><p>For kernel .text however, the situation is different since there are generic,
publicly-documented ways to obtain kernel base: hardware vulns. I personally
hadn’t ever used any and even saw them as a niche exploitation technique
relying on opaque CPU heuristics that don’t hold across models - not something
to be considered for resilient exploits. I was simply wrong, but thankfully
had access to many specialists (<a href="https://twitter.com/tehjh" target="_blank">@tehjh</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/_fel1x" target="_blank">@_fel1x</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_tsuro" target="_blank">@_tsuro</a>)
who knew better.</p>

<p>While side-channels that allow leaking memory across security boundaries
are hopefully bound to be mitigated, there are many side-channels that leak
addresses and which we haven’t heard much about since Spectre and friends.
These ones are probably here to stay even longer. For this project I used <a href="https://github.com/tpn/pdfs/blob/master/Jump%20Over%20ASLR%20-%20Attacking%20Branch%20Predictors%20to%20Bypass%20ASLR%20-%202016%20(micro16).pdf" target="_blank" title="jump over aslr paper">Jump Over ASLR</a>,
which was published before Spectre in 2016. It’s simple to understand (especially
with access to the aforementioned people) and there are PoCs that are just
waiting to be adjusted to your own scenario (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/felixwilhelm/mario_baslr" target="_blank" title="mario_baslr jump over aslr">mario_baslr</a>
from @_fel1x). Jump Over ASLR relies on the inner workings of the Branch Target
Buffer where user and kernel branches may collide. When that happens, the CPU
has more work to do and that can be observed. This allows leaking kernel base 
as long as you have offsets of branches hit during a short kernel path you
can trigger at will: you can then leverage the low entropy of KASLR to try
all possible base addresses and find the one where the branches are hit.</p>

<p>For the parameters (the branches to measure) you can really use whatever
you want. I only tried the <span>creat</span> syscall with arguments that cause a
fast return to userland, and then measured whether the <span>sys_creat</span> and
<span>do_sys_open</span> offsets had been hit. The offsets need to be fairly precise
but not to the byte since there seems to be some aliasing going on in the branch
predictor: I originally used <span>__fentry__</span> as an additional branch target
at a +5 offset for both symbols which still worked even though I later learned
these calls get <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/747256/" target="_blank">dynamically patched out</a>.
</p>

<p>With proper filtering of both false negatives and false positives (essentially
double checking each address) this works like a charm on recent Intel CPUs,
and it’s one of many such techniques that have been published in the past
6 years or so. That makes it something we should be able to rely on as exploit
developers for the foreseeable future. So for a known kernel image at least,
we are essentially back to pre-KASLR times - and keep in mind that it’s a
field I know fairly poorly so other side-channels are probably even better.</p>

<p><strong>Patch gap</strong></p><p>Ok here is what I personally found really interesting because I had never
looked into kernel bug timelines before. This bug was initially reported on
February 28 2020, and fixed in tip on March 3. At this point it’s essentially
public for anyone keeping an eye out for interesting kernel patches - even
if you don’t spend too much time on it, a <span>reported-by</span> Jann Horn is
worth looking into. The main kernel lines were fixed either on March 25 or
April 2. If you’re thinking “oh wow one whole month”, please be seated for
what’s coming.</p>

<p>Some distros applied the patch almost immediately:
</p><ul>
  <li>Arch Linux: Mar 25</li>
  <li>Gentoo: Mar 25</li>
  <li>Fedora: Mar 26</li>
</ul>


<p>I know they are not supposed to target workstations specifically but outside
of personal servers I don't think I have ever seen them used otherwise. The
2nd batch of distributions that fixed the bug is arguably more server-ready:
</p><ul>
  <li>Ubuntu 18.04 LTS: Apr 7</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: Apr 24</li>
  <li>Debian Buster …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few days ago I realized something. I don’t like writing.</p><p>I realized it because I found creative energy to work on programming projects again, and I experience writing programs differently from how I experience having to write. Even the turn of phrase “having to write” betrays my disposition toward the craft.</p><p>When I’m very excited to build products or just program computers for the joy of programming, I dread going to sleep and every part of me <em>cannot wait</em> to wake up and write code again. I’ve never felt that about writing. Writing has always been a chore. I think I’ve known this all along, but have never been able to admit this to myself until now.</p><p>When you read anything about anything anywhere, it tells you what great [INSERT CALLING HERE] do. Great startup founders and engineers write well and write a lot because without clear writing there is no clear thinking. I think I bought into that too much for my own good. So it feels liberating to say: <strong>I hate writing.</strong> It’s painful and laborious and every good piece of writing I make feels like delivering a baby. A rewarding experience for sure, but I think even the most loving of mothers would stop being so loving if she had to deliver a new baby every week.</p><p>One thing that duped me is a lot of positive reenforcement. My best pieces of writing get tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of readers, and that gives me an addicting sense of elation. I certainly never expected to make money doing it, but enough of you find my writing sufficiently interesting to offer the ultimate seal of approval— you transfer money from your wallet into mine. I deeply appreciate it, and deeply appreciate you spending time on reading my essays, but unfortunately this isn’t sufficient impetus for me to produce good work. When I’m forced to write on a schedule, my writing sucks and my life is miserable.</p><p>Which is a good reminder why some of my writing is good. It’s good when I have something important to say. Important things are hard to say by definition— if they were easy people would have already talked them out and they probably would have lost their importance. At least they’re hard to say for me. So when I do it it’s always very slow and painful, and it turns out good because I say something that matters to me in a way that nobody else bothered or managed to say. With my particular idiosyncrasies the intersection of that and the business of running a newsletter is an empty set.</p><p>So please stop paying me. For the folks that have prepaid, I’m not exactly sure how Substack tooling handles this situation, but shoot me an email and I’ll figure out how to return a prorated amount.</p><p>I will continue writing. When I have something important to say, I’ll go through the pain necessary for me to say it. I’ll also write about my observations as I pursue my product and programming work— technical, anthropological, and simply keeping you up to do date on what I’m up to. I don’t expect you’ll be hearing from me less often. In fact, I’m hoping this will allow me to write more. But owing people weekly essays as a matter of business isn’t my tao. For all the reasons above, and primarily because it makes the essays suck, and I don’t like producing bad work.</p><p>Until next week, hopefully. Slava.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>In 2018, I wrote <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2018/10/08/career-advice-recent-cs-graduates.html">Career advice for recent Computer Science graduates</a> about joining a big company instead of a startup after college.</p>

<p>In 2019, when I left NVIDIA, I wrote <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2019/12/23/leaving-nvidia-lessons.html">Lessons learned after my first full-time job</a> about leaving a big company for a startup.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve left my first full-time job at a startup, I want to revisit the topic. This is based on some personal experience, but most come from friends’ experiences, including the intensive note on startups from a friend who had worked at 3 startups before and who would like to remain anonymous. I hope that it’ll give some pointers to those trying to decide whether to take the leap.</p>

<p>Some asked if this post is about Snorkel. It’s not. Snorkel is an exception. It’s a great startup, which is a reason why I joined in the first place, and I recommend it to all my friends who are looking to join a startup.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Each of the points below is true for many startups, but not for all startups, and it’s more true for early-stage startups (e.g. before series B). There are always exceptions, extreme exceptions, unreasonable exceptions, which make the startup world so exciting.</li>
  <li>A friend told me that these points are only true for bad startups. Most startups are, unfortunately, bad startups.</li>

<h2 id="why_not_join_a_startup">7 reasons not to join a startup</h2>

<h3 id="1_work_life_balance">Reason 1. Goodbye work-life balance</h3>

<p>A friend at a tech giant told me that he and his co-workers once mused about how long they could go on not working until someone noticed. The answers were between a week and two months. At an early-stage startup, the answer is likely a couple of hours.</p>

<p>My transition from NVIDIA to Snorkel was a culture shock. At NVIDIA, you can have a predictable schedule, e.g. coming in at 9am and leaving at 6pm every day. If you don’t finish something by Friday afternoon, just push the deadline to next week and go to happy hour. It’s okay, even expected, to not check emails or Slack for the entire weekend.</p>

<p>On my first day at Snorkel, when I left at 7pm, I was the first one to leave.</p>

<p>Nobody told me how to spend my time, but when everyone else worked over the weekend and responded to my Slack messages any time of the night, I wanted to do the same. Nobody forced me to take on a hefty task that would require me to cancel plans with friends, but I also knew that everybody else had their hands full and if I didn’t do it, we wouldn’t be able to finish this feature on time and the company would lose a contract or even die.</p>

<p>By the time that I left, the work-life balance had got a lot more balanced. Snorkel had hired a ton more people to share the workload and we had worked out processes to speed things up.</p>

<p>In general, I’ve observed that the bigger the startup, the better the work-life balance. Possible explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The earlier the startup, the more precarious its survival, and the harder everyone has to push.</li>
  <li>In very early-stage startups, the working culture is dominated by those with high ownership in the company (the founding team), who are incentivized to work harder. Later on, the working culture is dominated by people with much lower ownership in the company (e.g. 0.1% over 4 years for the 20th engineer vs. 20% for the founder), who are more incentivized to keep a work-life balance.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: The work-life balance at an early-stage startup depends a lot on how much the existing team members work. When interviewing at a startup, don’t ask the founders how much they value work-life balance (they’ll say “A lot”), but ask every team member you can talk to how much they work. If all of them work during evenings and weekends, you might likely feel pressured to do the same.</p>

<h3 id="2_bad_engineering">Reason 2. You’ll pick up bad engineering practices</h3>

<p>Consider the following scenario. A customer requires a new feature and you have to deliver it in a week. This feature is similar to one of your existing features, so the best solution is to refactor the existing code to allow some of it to be reused.</p>

<p>However, refactoring alone would require a week. Your tech lead decides that you should just duplicate the existing code and turn it into a new feature. Now you have two massive code structures that are similar but not quite. When making changes to one structure, you have to remember to change the other too.</p>

<p>Then, somebody forgets and a wild bug appears. The person assigned to fix it isn’t given a lot of time, so instead of investigating the duplicate code, they write a hacky function on top.</p>

<p>Startups build 1 from 0, something from nothing. <em>Adding new things fast</em> takes precedence over both <em>adding good things slow</em> and <em>fixing existing things</em>. You might get used to writing quick and dirty code, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult programming</a>, merging code that has no tests, merging before tests complete, committing without comments, spaghetti code, magic numbers.</p>

<p>Bad practices might be a mere dissatisfaction at first, but can gradually become a habit, then become the only way you know how to work.</p>

<h3 id="3_mentorship">Reason 3. Less mentorship</h3>

<p>The thing I missed the most when leaving NVIDIA was mentorship. Large companies, by virtue of having a lot of employees, tend to have many people whose diverse life experience can provide you invaluable advice. At NVIDIA, I could come to my mentors for questions from general career dilemmas to obscure engineering knowledge. Once in a while, I browsed the org chart of tens of thousands of employees, identified people I want to learn from, and asked them to meet at the coffee machine, which they usually accepted.</p>

<p>Startups don’t have that many people for you to reach out to in the first place. Your handful of coworkers might have backgrounds and experiences similar to yours (cue founders who say they prefer hiring from their existing networks) and are unlikely to give you dramatically different perspectives. Even if there are people who could mentor you, given the pace at which startups move, they might not have the time for it.</p>

<p>To be clear, you can still learn a lot from your coworkers at startups, just a different kind of learning.</p>

<h3 id="4_equity">Reason 4. You won’t get rich</h3>

<p>Despite a plethora of articles warning people that joining startups is a bad way to get rich (<a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">1</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">2</a>, <a href="https://hunterwalk.medium.com/sorry-startup-employee-100-your-equity-probably-won-t-make-you-rich-d6549ece71bd">3</a>), many people still think joining a startup is a get-rich-quick scheme. Here’s the gist of the math. Imagine you’re an <strong>engineer with 2-3 years of experience</strong>.</p>

<p>If you join a startup as the <strong>15th engineer</strong> (not executive), your compensation might look like the following.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Base salary</strong>: Your base salary is usually lower than you would have got at a big company (e.g. <strong>$120K instead of $160K</strong>) because at startups, equity makes a large chunk of your compensation.</li>
  <li><strong>Equity</strong>: You might get <strong>0.05% - 0.25%</strong> equity vested over <strong>4 years</strong>. After subsequent fundraising rounds, this amount of equity is diluted to <strong>0.02% - 0.1% for 4 years</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>
<strong>If you join late at the startup (say employee number 100+), even if the company succeeds wildly, your equity will be worth very little.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to get rich, join a big company and climb their rank. You can find the detailed analysis of compensations for 19,000 FAAAM-dominated tech workers <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/01/18/tech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html">here</a>, but below is a plausible, even conservative, scenario if you join a company like Google with 2-3 years of experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st year, L4 $250K/year.</li>
  <li>2nd year, L4, $280K/year.</li>
  <li>3rd year, L4, $320K/year.</li>
  <li>4th year, L5, $360K/year.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the first 4 years at Google, you’ve already made over $1 million, not counting “perks” like work-life balance.</p>

<h3 id="5_management">Reason 5. Bad management</h3>

<p>There’s a trend among startups to not fixate on titles until they have to. Some avoid “manager” to not endanger the “everyone is equal” mindset (protip: everyone isn’t equal at startups – some have much more equity than others). In the early stage of a startup (e.g. before the 20th employee), there might not be anyone with “manager” in their title. If you join during that phase, you’re expected to get things done with little to no guidance.</p>

<p>Even if your startup has managers, they are likely bad managers. A startup’s first managers are likely its founding team who might have little to no real-world working experience, let alone managerial experience (e.g. recent dropouts, recent graduates). It doesn’t mean that people without working experience can’t be good managers (I know a few), it’s just more rare.</p>

<p>Bad management can manifest in the lack of feedback. At startups, you might get a lot of work-specific feedback – demos, design docs, even code (though it might not be good feedback) – because people at startups are generally more invested in the company. However, you won’t get much you-specific feedback that can help you grow such as what skills you’re lacking or what you need to do to get to the level you want to get to.</p>

<p>Even if there are processes in place for feedback, everyone might be too caught up in sprinting to think about you, what you want, or what opportunities they can give you to grow.</p>

<p>Bad management can be especially frustrating during conflicts, which will inevitably arise when you work in a high-stress environment (e.g. you’re all trying to push a feature at 11pm on a Saturday, everyone is tired and snappy). When something bothers you, you might feel like there’s no one you can talk to because you either …</p></div></div>

<p>The Lisp Machine manual describes both the language and the operating system
of the Lisp Machine.  The language, a dialect of Lisp called Zetalisp,
is completely documented
by this manual.  The software environment and operating-system-like parts of
the system contain many things which are still in a state of flux.
This manual confines itself primarily to the stabler parts of the
system.  It describes how to program, but not for the most part how to
operate the machine.  The window system is documented separately in
the Lisp Machine Window System manual.

<p>The Lisp Machine is a product of the efforts of many people too
numerous to list here and of the former unique unbureaucratic,
free-wheeling and cooperative environment of the M.I.T. Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory.  I believe that the commercialization of
computer software has harmed the spirit which enabled such systems to
be developed.  Now I am attempting to build a software-sharing movement to
revive that spirit from near oblivion.
</p>

<p>Since January 1984 I have been working primarily on the development of
GNU, a complete Unix-compatible software system for standard hardware
architectures, to be shared freely with everyone just like EMACS.
This will enable people to use computers and be good neighbors legally
(a good neighbor allows his neighbors to copy any generally useful
software he has a copy of).  This project has inspired a growing
movement of enthusiastic supporters.  Just recently the first free
portable C compiler compiled itself.  If you would like to contribute
to GNU, write to me at the address above.  Restrain social decay--help
get programmers sharing again.

<p>Conceptually, if we want two computer systems to communicate with each other,
all we need is a data link over which we can send a series of bits. This is
exactly what serial interfaces do. You can probably quickly imagine a simple
and effective scheme to send a series of bits in order, which is precisely why
there are a thousand different standards, many of them are confusingly similar
to each other, and the most popular are remarkably complex.</p>
<p>So, in this message, I will try to break down what exactly a "serial port" is.
I will only be talking about the hardware standards in this case, not the
software side of a COM port in Windows or a tty device in Unix derivatives.
That's an interesting topic, and I hope to write about it some time, but it
will be A Whole Thing. The software situation is at least as complicated as the
hardware side.</p>
<p>With that warning in place, let's look at this strictly from a consumer
perspective. Most computer users, or at least those with experience working
with serial ports, are familiar with serial in the form of a DE9[1] connector,
and often as opposed to a parallel port, which uses a truly enormous DB25
connector in order to send eight bits at a time. These were the two primary
peripheral interfaces of old computers. Actually, that's not quite true; it's
more accurate to say that these two were the primary peripheral interfaces
of early personal computers that managed to survive into the modern era,
basically because they were adopted by various iterations of the IBM PC, which
is the platonic ideal of a personal computer.</p>
<p>To simplify the history somewhat, the pseudo-standard parallel port was
designed in order to simplify the construction of printers. Although that
advantage basically disappeared as printer technology changed, parallel ports
remained conventional for printers for many years after. In practice they had
few advantages over serial connectors and so basically died out with the
printers that used them. We should all be glad, the time it took to send a
rasterized page to a laser printer over a parallel interface was truly
infuriating.</p>
<p>It would be surprising to run into a parallel interface in use these days,
although I'm sure there are a few out there. It is quite common, though, to
find serial ports today. They're remarkably durable. This is partially because
they are extremely simple, and thus inexpensive to implement. It is mostly
because they are predominantly used by the kind of industries that love to
have weird proprietary connectors, and serial is the ultimate way to have a
weird proprietary connector, because it is one of the least standardized
standards I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Serial ports on computers are vaguely related to an EIA/TIA standard called
RS-232. In fact, a number of computers and other devices label these ports
RS-232, which is a bold move because they are almost universally non-compliant
with that specification. There are usually several ways that they violate the
standard, but the most obvious is that RS-232 specifies the use of a DB25
connector, with, you guessed it, 25 pins. "Good god, 25 pins for a simple
serial connection?" you say. That's right, 25 pins. It is precisely because of
that bourgeois excess of pins that personal computer manufacturers, as an
industry, decided to trash the standard and use the smaller DE9 connector
instead.</p>
<p>In order to understand RS-232 and it's amusingly large connector specification
better, we need to understand a bit about the history of the standard.
Fortunately, that will also help a bit in understanding the baffling complexity
of actually making serial interfaces work today.</p>
<p>RS-232 was originally introduced to connect a terminal (originally a TTY) to a
modem. The specification was actually rather specific to that purpose, which
shows when we look at all the bonus pins. More generically, RS-232 is designed
to connect "data terminal equipment" (DTE) to "data communications equipment"
(DCE). As you often run into with these sorts of cabling, the TX pin of one
computer needs to connect to the RX pin of the other, and vice versa. For this
reason, the two devices on a serial connection should have their RX and TX pins
reversed compared to each other. </p>
<p>The terms DTE and DCE are usually used to identify these two different
configurations. That said, it was sometimes necessary to, for example, connect
two computers to each other, when both used the same interface. Further, some
manufacturers made (and continue to make) inconsistent decisions about whether
the computer or peripheral should be DCE or DTE. This necessitates using a
"null modem" cable, which is the equivalent of "crossover" for Ethernet before
GbE specified a far more flexible MDI.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out whether you should use a null modem or straight through
cable, which is usually easiest to do by experimentation, is just the first of
the many fun steps in successfully using a serial device.</p>
<p>Conceptually, RS-232 functions in an extremely simple way. To transmit a one,
you put a high (positive) voltage on the TX pin. To transmit a zero, you put a
low (negative) voltage on the TX pin. This is in reference to a ground pin,
which is usually connected right to local ground.</p>
<p>This gets us to our second bit of serial complexity, after figuring out whether
or not we need to add an extra swap in the RX and TX wires: clock recovery. In
most cases (we'll get to the exceptions later maybe), there is no explicit
clock information provided by a serial connection. Instead, the receiving
device must heuristically recover the clock rate. Some serial devices work this
out by expecting the transmitter to always send a certain preamble (common in
some industrial control and other situations), but the problem is solved more
generally by the convention of sending a "start bit" and "stop bit" of one and
zero successively, before and after each byte. This ensures at least one
transition and helps with detecting the timing of the whole byte.</p>
<p>Most devices expect one and one bit. Some devices expect two of each. Some
devices expect none at all (although they then usually use a protocol that
expects a preamble).</p>
<p>From this mess, you might think that the RS-232 standard does not specify any
method of clock synchronization. In fact, it does. It's just not implemented
on PC serial interfaces.</p>
<p>So I said 25 pins. Now we know what our first five are: we have ground, tx,
rx, and two pins that are used for synchronization, one in each direction.
That's 5. What about the other twenty?</p>
<p>Well, some are just for stuff that no one uses any more. There's a pin to
select the data rate (rarely used and unimplemented on PCs). There's a pin for
a transceiver self-test feature (rarely used and unimplemented on PCs). But
most of all, there is telephone modem arcana.</p>
<p>Remember, RS-232 was designed fairly specifically for a terminal to communicate
with its modem. Modems at the time had some fairly peculiar requirements and
restrictions. An obvious one is that the modem needs to signal the terminal
when it is ringing (in the sense of a phone), and there's a pin for that.
There's also a pin to indicate that the DCE has established a connection with
a remote DCE. There are two pins that the DTE can use to essentially conduct
a handshake with the DCE in preparation for sending data, a requirement due to
the half-duplex nature of modems. There are two pins for similar, but different
readiness negotiation in the other direction.</p>
<p>Most entertaining of all, there is <em>an entire second serial connection.</em> That's
right, the RS-232 standard specifies pins on the cable for a complete second
data path with its own data pins and control pins.</p>
<p>Add all this up and you get somewhere near 25, but not quite, because there are
a few unused.</p>
<p>When early PC manufacturers (but mostly IBM) were hunting around for a fairly
general-purpose interface to connect peripherals, RS-232 looked like a pretty
good solution because it was fairly simple to implement and provided a good
data rate. The problem is that it was over complicated. So, they just took the
parts they didn't like and threw them in the trash. The result is "RS-232
lite," a loosely specified standard that carried RS-232-esque signaling over a
smaller DE9 connector.</p>
<p>Here are the pins of the DE9 connector:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data carrier detect (DCD)</li>
<li>Rx</li>
<li>Tx</li>
<li>Data terminal ready (DTR)</li>
<li>Ground</li>
<li>Data set ready (DSR)</li>
<li>Request to send (RTS)</li>
<li>Clear to send (CTS)</li>
<li>Ring indicator</li>
</ol>
<p>This has the ground and two signal pins that we know we need, and then many,
but not all, of the control pins specified by RS-232. Notably, no clock pins,
meaning that properly synchronous serial standards (like several early computer
network standards) cannot be carried on these RS-232 interfaces. Don't worry,
this didn't stop anyone from trying to do general-purpose networking with these
things.</p>
<p>Quick sidebar: I said positive and negative voltage earlier. The RS-232
standard is really unspecific about these and in newer revisions they can range
from 3 to 25 volts, either positive or negative. As a de facto norm, most
computer "RS-232-ish" interfaces use 13 volts, but there are exceptions. The
standard requires that all interfaces tolerate up to the full 25 volts, but
I would not trust this too far.</p>
<p>So what about all the control pins that PC serial interfaces retain... well,
this gets us into the world of flow control. Often, when communicating with a
peripheral or another computer, it is necessary to somehow signal when you are
capable of receiving data (e.g. room in buffer). This is conventionally done on
serial ports by using the RTS and CTS pins to indicate readiness to receive
data by the DTE and DCE respectively, which is consistent with which ends of
the connection "own" those pins in the proper RS-232 specification. This is all
fine and good.</p>
<p>Except for it's not, because there are a number of serial devices out there
which do not implement the RTS/CTS pins for whatever reason (mostly money
reasons, I assume). So, a second convention …</p></article></div>

This is for users that are at least already familiar with the Blender UI as I will not be sharing details about scene setup, shortcuts or render settings.</p><p>My scene setup is fairly simple consisting of a few models, a plane with an added displacement/height map (terrain), a sun light and a spot light (for the antenna). As we can see from the screenshots below, the lightning looks very harsh because it illuminates the scene without any diffusion from small particles in the scene such as air/pollution.

Although by using this method you will get way longer rendering times, the final result is much better and has a more natural look and feel. The light is soft and diffused thanks to the added volume, which makes the scene alive and more present.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1.jpg 1200w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-744x496.jpg 744w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-420x280.jpg 420w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-560x373.jpg 560w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-930x620.jpg 930w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p>That’s all for now, and I hope someone gets inspired by this :)</p><p>Read other stuff <a title="Blog" href="https://petarpetkovski.net/blog/">here</a>.</p></div></article></div></div></main></div></div>]]>

  <h3 id="retro-computing">Retro computing</h3>

<p>Going back to the roots of your field can provide new insights into your day to day experience. For me, the roots are located in the 70s / 80s a time when personal computers were much simpler and could be fully understood by a regular person. This is a time when the most popular computers were the Vic20, Apple II and later Commodore 64.</p>

<p><img src="https://jfoucher.com/uploads/2021/02/VIC-20.jpg" alt="Vic-20">
<img src="https://jfoucher.com/uploads/2021/02/Apple_II.jpg" alt="Apple II"></p>



<p>These computers booted in less than a second to a raw basic prompt. To be clear: you turn on your computer, and less than one second later you start programming. How wonderful would that be, in our land of a thousand node dependencies, failing composer upgrades and wrong vagrant configurations?</p>

<h3 id="what-to-build">What to build?</h3>

<p>I was increasingly interested in electronics since doing a project for a friend, so I thought to myself “How hard can it be?” Well, as it turns out, quite, but that’s hardly the point right now. The point is: what should I build? I started by building a simple 6502 based computer on a breadboard. I soon realised that if I was to have anything half useful I was going to need the entire breadboard production of China to be delivered to my house. Also breadboard computers are buggy and you can’t move them around because then a cable will come loose and you will spend five hours troubleshooting your code instead.</p>

<p>So I decided I would convert it to PCBs. They are pretty cheap to get delivered from China, but since they take about a month to arrive the rate of iteration is not so great. Better to get it right the first time obviously.</p>

<p>Well I almost did. The first one was very simple, only having a 6502 processor and an 6522 parallel port interface. I interfaced with it from my computer via SPI through an arduino: the 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter can bit bang SPI easily enough. The Arduino Uno/Nano can be an SPI slave easily enough and receive that data. It can then transmit that data to my computer using serial over USB.</p>

<p>That worked fine (after a couple of bodge wires) but was a bit kludgy, having the Arduino sort of hanging there by a few cables.</p>

<p>I then tried to design a single board computer with everything I would ever want on it: serial communication, parrallel port, SPI port(s), i2c port(s), PS/2 port for a keyboard, sound chip, VGA output, etc… The board to house all of this was very big and thus very expensive. Combining this with the previous point regarding getting it right the first time, a single board computer suddenly seemed like not that great of an idea.</p>

<h3 id="the-plan">The plan</h3>

<p>I then decided to build a board with basic circuitry into which other boards that provided actual functionality will be able to plug in. Turns out that already exists and is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane">backplane</a></p>

<p>So backplane it is then. The size limit for this board and all others will be 10cm x 10cm as that it the cheap price limit for most cheap board houses (yes I’m cheap and I like cheap, preferably cheap that works).</p>

<p>Here is the backplane design:</p>

<p><img src="https://jfoucher.com/uploads/2021/02/backplane.png" alt="backplane 3D view"></p>

<p>As you can see, it is mostly just slots to plug in the extension boards. The only active components are the clock generation circuit, and some decoding to activate the expansion slots when they are needed.</p>

<p>The rightmost slot is reserved for the CPU card. The CPU card includes some RAM and ROM, which means the computer is already functional with just this single board plugged in, although admittedly it won’t <em>do</em> much in that configuration.</p>

<p>To get the computer to do stuff it’s best to plug in some additional boards.</p>

<p>The initial design includes an IO board with PS/2 port, SPI ports and a parallel port (and LEDs, of course it has LEDs!) as well as a serial board to allow the user to communicate with the computer.</p>

<p>After waiting patiently forever for the boards to arrive, I put it all together and gave it a try. It did not work at all. Of course there were mistakes on the boards, which confirmed the soudness of my choice of not doing one huge board at once.
However not all the boards were defective, and the bad ones were quickly fixed with a few wires here and there.</p>

<p>After which, plugging a usb to serial adapter into the serial board, and into a usb port on my computer, I could see the Planck computer doing something!</p>

<p>Here it is running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> over serial</p>

<p><img src="https://jfoucher.com/uploads/2021/02/running-forth.jpg" alt="Forth over serial on the Planck computer"></p>

<p>I am currently working on more expansion boards, such as an LCD board, a sound card, and a VGA card. <a href="https://jfoucher.com/feed.xml">Stay tuned</a> for more.</p>

February 28, 2021 | https://freshbsd.org/news/2021/02/28 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://freshbsd.org/news/2021/02/28">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2><a href="https://freshbsd.org/news/2021/02/28">FreshBSD 2021</a></h2></header><section><p>6 weeks ago I created a branch for a significant rework of FreshBSD.  Nearly 300
commits later, and just a week shy of our 15th anniversary, the result is what
you’re looking at now.  I hope you like it.</p>

<p>There’s loads of internal changes, but here’s the main user-facing stuff:</p>



<p>We have a new vector logo I knocked together in <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>,
a new <a href="https://slimselectjs.com/">drop-down select library</a>, a new pagination
widget that offers to reverse the sort order rather than encouraging you to visit
page 170,000, and a variety of style tweaks to (hopefully) make things a bit nicer.</p>

<h2 id="prettier-urls">Prettier URLs</h2>

<p>The site has a new URL scheme, and a much better system for generating them from queries.
Where possible they’ll be automatically applied using JavaScript to make sharing links
more pleasant.  For example, this monstrosity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/search?q=&amp;project%5B%5D=freebsd&amp;repository%5B%5D=src&amp;branches%5B%5D=releng%2F12.0&amp;sort=commit_date</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/freebsd/src/branch/releng/12.0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old URLs should continue to work.</p>



<p>A new grouped <code>Source</code> filter replaces <code>Project</code> and <code>Repository</code>, making it much
easier to go straight to the repositories you’re interested in.</p>

<p>There’s also a new filter for merge commits, though this currently only works for git-based
repositories.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Old front page: 4,814 DOM elements, 148 KiB, 2.3s to interactive.</li>
  <li>New front page: 1,616 DOM elements, 37 KiB, 0.5s to interactive</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a combination of improvements, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removal of jQuery and Font-Awesome’s WebFont/CSS</li>
  <li>Branch/tag/committer filters being suppressed</li>
  <li>Result counts and aggregations calculated in the background during rendering</li>
  <li>Multithreaded commit rendering</li>
  <li>Reduction in per-page results from 50 to 30</li>
  <li>Improved caching, with a warmup query for the front page on index updates</li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve done a lot of work to improve the quality of the code, which in turn makes
further changes easier and more appealing.  This also brings us closer to the
point at which I’ll be comfortable publishing the codebase.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I hope you continue to find the site useful.  If you have any
feedback, please email me at <a href="mailto:tom@hur.st">tom@hur.st</a>, or Tweet me at
@blaagh.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

Somewhat perversely, MIT decided to rewrite Scratch in Flash (belch) ‘for better browser support’ and seem to have abandoned the ‘old’ Squeak based system.

<h2>
History:
</h2>
In the late 1970s and early 1980s (the good old days of "hobby computing") before
the IBM PC and its clones took over the world, various microprocessor based kits
appeared on the hobbyist market. You could build a Z80-based board with 8K of
RAM, and with its hexadecimal keypad and LED display you could run simple
programs laboriously keyed in hex.
<p>
The first generation commercial machines also appeared - usually based on
the 8080 or the Z80 or 6502. The Commodore PET was one of the early sucesses
and it, along with the Commodore 64, Sinclair's three machines (ZX80, ZX81 and
Spectrum) and the BBC Micro probably accounted for most of the infant home-computer
market in Britain.
</p><p>
I decided on a different approach. Unhappy with the concept of having to re-live
the glory-days of the
<a href="http://www.computer50.org/mark1/MM1.html">
Manchester MkI
</a>
with the hobby-boards fraternity (!), and unhappy with the straitjacketed
architectures and joke operating systems of the 1st generation home computers,
I yearned for more. Specifically, what I wanted was something
more like a Unix clone at home. I was used to V7 Unix on the PDP-11 at university
and wasn't keen to step backwards 10 years to the technology of CP/M and BASIC
programming.
<br>
<i>
I wasn't to know that eight years later a guy called Linus
Torvalds was going to think the same thoughts and do much the same things. The
big difference was that he was in the right place and the right time and 
had internet connectivity - I didn't have any of these advantages!
</i>
</p><p>
I went off and built myself a 6809 based computer with 64K of RAM, a 360K
floppy disk drive and an RS232 interface which could drive a glass-TTY.
Please remember that this was 1982. Hard disks, megabytes of RAM and other
familiar modern things were a long way off.
</p><p>
After going through the usual hard work of writing a BIOS complete with
an S-records downloader, I was in a position to write myself an operating
system. Preliminary work on OMU started in late 1983. My earliest surviving
printouts of the sources on yellowed, faded lineprinter paper show that the
bulk of the work on OMU dates from March/April/May 1984.
</p><p>
Work was not helped by the fact that I was having to write a 'C' compiler
in parallel, but certainly by mid 1984 I had a perfectly usable O/S with a
primitive shell, a port of Unix 'ed' for an editor, and with 'fsck' and other
such tools available to repair the filestore disks when they got damaged by
miswrites from the rather dodgy floppy-disk hardware. I remember taking
the machine home over Christmas 1984 and typing up several reports using it
on the kitchen table.
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
I just found this photo of the 1984 machine amongst a box of slides taken
over that Christmas. It appears to be the only photo of the machine I ever
took at the time.
<p>
At this point in its evolution, the hardware was mostly on one double
eurocard, with a floppy-disk interface piggybacked onto it. The floppy-disk
drive is in the metal box at front, and the bigger metal box at the RHS
of the PCBs is the power-supply.

</tbody></table>
</p><h2>
Features and misfeatures list:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Tiny (24K) Kernel.
</li><li>
V7 Unix-compatable filestore (doesn't support triple-indirection blocks).
Not exactly critical on a floppy-disk-only system!
</li><li>
Normal Unix-style use of /dev/* files to interface to devices.
</li><li>
Mountable/dismountable filestores as expected.
</li><li>
Shell is built-in to save space, rather than run as a process.
</li><li>
tty driver is exceedingly minimal, but functional.
</li><li>
No true multitasking (see below).
</li><li>
UIDs and GIDs not implemented. They're ignored on the filestore, and the
process table doesn't bother to hold them. Any files created would be given
UID = GID = 0.
</li></ul>
<p>
The lack of an MMU and the small amount of RAM available meant that I
decided against trying to implement true multitasking. Instead (like DOS
as it happens) I came up with a scheme whereby a process could launch another
process, but would have to wait for it to complete. Clunky, but it worked
OK.
</p><p>
For your entertainment (or possibly if you're interested in the possibility
of porting my old O/S to more modern hardware like that old XT that's
gathering dust under your table) here's a downloadable copy of my
final version of the 6809 OMU as it stood in 1987:
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
In order to make any use of OMU, I had compiled up a set of utilities like
'ed' and 'mount' and 'fsck'. Sadly I don't think I can make their sources
downloadable here as they were based on the Unix V7 sources for which we had
a Bell Labs "academic use" licence at the university.
</p><p>
<strong>
<span color="#FF0000">
NEW!
</span>
</strong>
The above packages now include some utilities which I did write from scratch:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>adb</strong>
An interactive disassembler. (Doesn't debug core-dumps though, just lets
you look at code in files).
</li><li><strong>aka</strong>
("Also Known As") - finds other files hardlinked to the one mentioned on the
command-line.
</li><li><strong>chbase</strong>
Prints the number(s) given on the command-line in octal, decimal &amp; hex.
</li><li><strong>hex</strong>
Makes Motorola S-record files for sending to the 6809. Usually runs on a
host machine (a PDP-11 originally).
</li><li><strong>ida</strong>
An intelligent disassembler - shares source-code with 'adb' above.
</li><li><strong>sh</strong>
The tiny shell needed by the OMU kernel. OMU runs this as if it was the
'init' process.
</li><li><strong>sirius</strong>
An interactive disk-examination program.
</li><li><strong>unhex</strong>
A program to convert Motorola S-records into an OMU-loadable file. Usually
runs on the 6809 itself of course.
</li></ul>
Sorry, no documentation, but the source-code should be documentation enough!
<p>
I
<strong>
don't
</strong>
suggest any modern user of OMU on a 6809 tries getting GNU utilities running
with it! Bear in mind that V7 sources would compile into a smaller executable
than any modern GNU equivalents. With the 64K memory-address limitation of my
6809, this was important! The BIOS and O/S accounted for about 24K of this, so
user-programs were limited to about 40K total. I never did complete my
page-switched 256K memory system.....
</p><p>
Mind you, if you're contemplating porting to a 68000 or IBM-PC, the size
constraints will be much less of a problem.
</p><hr>
<p>
My work on OMU was pretty much unnoticed by anyone else in the world (we didn't
have an internet connection in those days), but others in the Electrical
Engineering dept at Swansea University saw the potential to port OMU to one of
several 68000 single-board-computers which began to appear in the department
from about 1984/85 onwards.
</p><p>
My colleage Terry Barnaby and I were variously involved with porting OMU
to several of these 68000 based SBCs. Terry did most of the work!
The first stage was merely to take OMU and get it to run on the new
hardware much as my 6809 version was doing already. This was accomplishe
reasonably quickly, complete with the addition of the OMU's first driver
for a hard-disk.
The much greater memory-addressing ability of the 68000 coupled with the
fact that the SBCs typically had 256K of RAM on board meant that this version
of OMU soon featured some multi-tasking capabilities (though with no MMU
available the processes had to be well-behaved).
</p><p>
For convenience, the details of the filestore layout and the system-call
interface of 68000 OMU was designed to duplicate those of the commercial 68000
V7 Unix system made by "Codata" (we had just taken delivery of two of these
units to augment the aging PDP-11).
It is I think a credit to OMU's potential that
it soon became possible to compile programs on the Codata, and run them on
OMU with no problems. Indeed, it was also possible to take system binaries
shipped with the Codata and run them on OMU too - an easy way to get 'vi'
and other state-of-the-art (!) software on OMU without having to dig out the
sources and recompile!
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
Terry Barnaby and another of his colleages Tim Ingersoll then made some
fundamental changes to the message-handling abilities of the 68000 OMU port to
make it suitable for Real-Time signal processing and control applications.
This was after all what the two of them really
wanted as part of their Ph.D projects...! In 1988 they finished their
projects, wrote up and left. Part of their legacy was the RTOS version of OMU,
and I managed to salvage a set of sources for that too:
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
If any reader of these pages feels suitably daring they may be able to
beat me to the target of porting OMU (probably working from Terry's and my
initial 68000 version above) to the IBM PC. I consider that there really is no
point in aiming for the 386 processor machines onwards as Linux already does
everything you could hope for on that class of machines.
</p><p>
It does however seem that there is mileage in starting with the boot-loader
that comes with
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/">
FreeDOS
</a>,
and getting OMU to run on 8086/80286 machines of which there must be
<strong>
loads
</strong>
lying around virtually unwanted these days.
</p><p>
If you do decide to try such a thing, then I wish you the best of luck and
I'll offer any email help I can. My email address is in the README file
included with the any of the sets of downloadable sources.
</p><h2>
Acknowledgements:
</h2>
My thanks go to Terry and Tim whose work in enhancing OMU is credited here
and really should have been reflected in a name-change from OMU back in the
Eighties! (I never did get it straight in my mind as to whether the "one man"
mentioned in the title were there to signify the number of authors or
the number of simultaneous users. Either way, neither was very relevant once
as the software started its modest spread in the department.)
<p>
My thanks also go to Alan Cox (he of Linux networking and kernel hacking fame)
without whose prodding this page might never have been written.

<h2 id="becoming-a-contributor">Becoming a contributor</h2>

<p>Whether you want to fix a typo in comments or introduce a brand new feature,
there are a few steps which make the process smoother:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <a href="https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation ID</a>, if you don’t have one yet. You’ll need this to subscribe to the mailing lists and to access the bugs and blueprints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.tungsten.io/g/dev">dev@lists.tungsten.io</a> mailing list. If you wish, there are also <a href="https://lists.tungsten.io/">several other mailing lists</a> you can join as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wiki currently contains legal and technical docs, event decks and similar resources to boost your
understanding of Tungsten Fabric. This material will eventually be moving to
<a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/">the wiki</a> or Git repositories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tungstenfabric/shared_invite/enQtMzM0MjMyMDIzMzk3LTZmY2FmY2JlZmRjN2YxMzgyOTNkNDZiNTRiYWU0NTRmNzI3N2RjMDIwY2UxZDlkODgzZDE0YzQ3MTlhNTg0N2I">Join Slack</a>. Post your questions to relevant channels, don’t abuse @here,
get help and help others. The mailing list works best for long-running
discussions; Slack is great for ad-hoc conversations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you push anything, you’ll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement
or CLA: either Individual CLA (ICLA) if you are an independent contributor, or
Corporate CLA (CCLA). We suggest you sign a CCLA if you are employed at a company
which pays you for your Tungsten Fabric-related work. CCLA also simplifies things
if your teammates plan to contribute as well. Both ICLA and CCLA are legal documents.
Please read them carefully. It’s usually smart to run the document past your
company’s legal department before signing and submitting it, if only to verify
that your contribution will be within your company’s policy. You can find all
ICLA/CCLA documents in the <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/Contributor+License+Agreement">Tungsten Fabric CLA Wiki</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’ve found a bug, <a href="https://jira.tungsten.io/projects/TFB/issues/TFB-15?filter=allopenissues">file a bug report</a> against the respective release in
Jira. Be sure to describe both expected and actual behavior. You’ll need
the bug ID later, so please do this even if you feel the change is trivial.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you plan to develop a new feature, you must create or provide three things:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://jira.tungsten.io/projects/TFP/issues/TFP-6?filter=allopenissues">A blueprint</a>. A blueprint is a short piece of text describing which feature do you propose, why it is good to have it in Tungsten Fabric, and who will be developing it. Blueprints are very important as they are used to plan future releases of Tungsten Fabric.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-specs">A detailed technical spec</a>. Each blueprint should link to a more detailed technical specification document. These specifications must be submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-specs">contrail-specs</a> GitHub repository. They are not stored or tracked in Jira.</li>
      <li><a href="https://jira.tungsten.io/projects/TFB/issues/TFB-15?filter=allopenissues">A Jira bug ticket</a>. While the blueprint briefly describes the work that will be done, the ticket is where the work actually happens (commits get linked to the ticket).</li>
      <li>Here is <a href="https://jira.tungsten.io/browse/TFP-13">an example of a complete Jira blueprint</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Although contrail-specs and other Tungsten Fabric repositories are hosted on
<a href="http://github.com/tungstenfabric">GitHub</a>, they are managed with Gerrit. Please don’t send Pull Requests to the
GitHub repositories, and go to <a href="https://review.opencontrail.org/">https://review.opencontrail.org</a> instead.
Blueprint specs are submitted this way as well.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Note that Tungsten Fabric is currently migrating from Juniper owned <a href="https://review.opencontrail.org/">https://review.opencontrail.org</a> to [https://github.com/tungstenfabric/] email discuss@lists.tungsten.io for the latest information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>After getting Gerrit access as described below, clone the specs repository
with the command:
<code>git clone https://review.opencontrail.org/Juniper/contrail-specs</code>
and install the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/infra/git-review/">git-review extension</a> which will allow you to submit specs as
well as code changes. In order to write a spec, start by copying the template
<code>blueprint_template.md</code> to a meaningful name in the appropriate subdirectory
for the release that you would like to target.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all of these in place, you are now ready to submit your specs and code to
Tungsten Fabric! How to write these specs and code is a different story though,
but we hope the links in the next section will help you to get started. You may
also want to consult a more detailed how-to available <a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-community-docs/blob/master/Contributor/GettingStarted/getting-started-with-opencontrail-development.md">here</a>, in the
contrail-community-docs repo. And of course, feel free to ask questions on the
mailing list and in Slack channels!</p>

<h4 id="column-meanings">Column Meanings</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Release: The numeric identifier of the release</li>
  <li>Blueprint Due: Tungsten Fabric currently uses Jira, so the blueprint
due here refers to the <a href="https://jira.tungsten.io/projects/TFP/issues/TFP-6?filter=allopenissues">Jira Blueprint</a> which will be reviewed by the TSC for strategic alignment and release planning.</li>
  <li>Specification Due: The specification or “spec” is design document with
section headings that should be filled in, or at least though about and decided
to be non-applicable. Specs should be submitted as described earlier in this
document.</li>
  <li>Dev Complete: This column may be considered synonymous with “feature freeze”
and is intended to mark the transition from “new development” to “testing,
debugging and making production-ready”.</li>
  <li>GA Release: This column is the target release date. Historically Contrail has
usually missed release dates in order to finish incomplete features. Tungsten
Fabric will attempt to move to a time based release model, but this is still
under discussion.</li>

    <section>




<p>4300 words, 14 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This post was circulated privately in April 2020. Three months later the government announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101124331/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huawei-to-be-removed-from-uk-5g-networks-by-2027">Huawei 5G equipment will be removed from the UK by 2027</a>, a reversal of their previous position. I’ve updated the timeline with that development. Otherwise, the text is almost unchanged from the original. Keep that in mind. It follows my <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/huawei-5g/">July 2019</a> post on the consideration the UK and its allies are giving to Huawei as a supplier of 5G mobile equipment. If you didn’t read that, now is a good time. - Nick Hutton, 29th November 2020.</p>

<p><em>4000 years ago the Chinese invented “Go”. Unlike Indo-European Chess, Go takes longer to play and uses a larger board. In Go, the goal is not to confront your opponent directly as one does in Chess. The winning system in Go is to surround them gradually and occupy their territory.</em></p>

<h3 id="current-events">Current Events</h3>

<p>In the nine months since my last post, the UK elected a Prime Minister, formed a new government, resiled from the European Union, and fought a global pandemic. However, we’ve struggled to reach a consensus on whether or not we should buy 5G network equipment from Huawei, a designated <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/ncsc-advice-on-the-use-of-equipment-from-high-risk-vendors-in-uk-telecoms-networks#section_5">High-Risk Vendor</a>. Here’s a summary of events since my last post:</p>

<ul>
<li>The government announced Huawei can supply up to 35% of edge (non-core) equipment to Mobile Network Operators.<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>NCSC’s Technical Director, Dr Ian Levy lamented the lack of 5G suppliers, endorsed the Edge vs Core distinction for improving supplier diversity, and endorsed technical measures as an effective strategy for mitigating the security risks.<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>USA, Australia, and New Zealand restated a commitment to ban Huawei from national mobile networks. Canada was “studying the British decision (to permit Huawei)”.<sup id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>The EU released a toolbox for 5G to “identify a possible common set of measures which are able to mitigate the main cybersecurity risks of 5G networks.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Parliament debated the security implications of the “up to 35%” decision.<sup id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></li>
<li>I wrote this post and circulated it privately among interested parties.</li>
<li>A Commons Defence sub Committee was convened to inquire into the security of the UK 5G networks.<sup id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></li>
<li>MPs attempted unsuccessfully to have High-Risk Vendors excluded from 5G networks.<sup id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></li>
<li>Huawei presented the ITU with a vision of an Internet where nation-states are the locus of control.<sup id="fnref:8"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></li>
<li>The US began requiring a license for the export of certain technologies that help foreign manufacturers produce semiconductors which are then sold to Huawei.<sup id="fnref:9"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup></li>
<li>The Prime Minister instructed officials to draw up plans to reduce Huawei’s involvement in UK 5G to zero.<sup id="fnref:10"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></li>
<li>China’s UK ambassador said abandoning Huawei could jeopardise the UK’s new nuclear power plants and high-speed rail.<sup id="fnref:11"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></li>
<li>The government announced a ban on buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 2020 and ordered its removal by 2027.<sup id="fnref:12"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup></li>
<li>NCSC’s Dr Levy blogged again, about how “everything had changed”. Huawei was out.<sup id="fnref:13"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup></li>
<li>TikTok, the popular Chinese owned social media company announced it would scrap plans for a UK HQ.<sup id="fnref:14"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup></li>
<li>Installation of new Huawei 5G equipment is to be prohibited after September 2021, earlier than anticipated.<sup id="fnref:15"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup></li>
<li>As of 29th November 2020, UK network operators continued to buy and install Huawei equipment and contend that it will save them hundreds of millions of pounds compared to other vendors.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to talk about the UK’s strategy for dealing with High-Risk Vendors. First in general terms and then specifically about statements made by Dr Levy about Huawei before the UK’s eventual about-face. I’ll focus on the technical aspects of risk mitigation and in so doing move this discussion from the abstract to the concrete. Finally, I’ll attempt to place the UK’s strategy within the wider context of future UK/China relations.</p>

<p>Why after all this time are we still talking about Huawei?</p>

<h3 id="man-in-the-vendor">Man In The Vendor</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security">Supply Chain Risk</a> or “Man In The Vendor” (MiTV) as I call it, is one of Cyber Security’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem"><em>wicked problems</em></a>. Wickedness isn’t about difficulty. Wicked problems are different because traditional processes can’t resolve them satisfactorily. They have countless causes or factors, are hard to describe, and don’t have a right answer. I use the term MiTV because “Supply Chain Risk” sounds like something you could dilute or diversify away. It sounds like something you could outsource or insure against. MiTV sounds like what it is. There’s a man. He’s in the vendor. He has something to gain from being there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MiTV is hard to detect and counter in enterprise environments and <em>very hard</em> within mobile network operators. By definition, a network operator’s business is the shared use of that hardware and software. Different customer’s traffic, management traffic, security-critical commands and data, all flowing through the same chassis, circuit boards, processors, and memory. You trust the system to keep all this separate. When you have a MiTV, the system lies to you. - <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/huawei-5g/">“The Eutopian. 29th July 2019”</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="mitv-in-practice">MiTV In Practice</h3>

<p>Any vendor can suffer a MiTV. Most incidents go unreported. How does this man get in the vendor and what does he do? No need for abstract threats. We have real cases. We don’t even have to put ourselves in the mind of a foreign adversary.</p>

<ol>
<li>Vendors are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">pressured</a> by governments to weaken their security.</li>
<li>Supply chains are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200421225552/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/">compromised</a> and hardware or software tampered with.</li>
<li>Vendor operations are <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/">hacked</a>.</li>
<li>Sometimes the man isn’t just in the vendor, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200512022950/https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/geheimdienstaffaere-cryptoleaks-weltweite-spionage-operation-mit-schweizer-firma-aufgedeckt">owns it</a>.</li>
<li>Infiltration can be so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200421033936/https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/hackers-were-inside-citrix-for-five-months/">deep</a> that the man might as well be writing the vendor’s product.</li>
<li>Sometimes the man <em>is</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200530081851/https://www.wired.com/2015/12/researchers-solve-the-juniper-mystery-and-they-say-its-partially-the-nsas-fault/">writing the vendor’s product</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a man is in the vendor he can tamper with the software, hardware, or firmware that makes up their product. He can introduce malicious code or physical components before, and sometimes after equipment enters service. Even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200601080443/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/inside-the-nsas-leaked-catalog-of-surveillance-magic/">cables</a> can be turned against you when you can’t trust your supply chain.</p>

<p>Not only can a network operator’s equipment be made to lie to them, but it’s common for mobile network operators to outsource some of the build and management of their networks to the equipment vendor. The operator buys a package. Equipment, support, and services to keep it running. It’s convenient because expertise is hard to come by and such equipment needs frequent updates. These arrangements provide an opportunity for compromise of the network throughout its lifecycle. In these cases, the hardware or software product doesn’t need to be flawed or weakened when you buy it. It’s enough that the engineers managing it and the tools and systems they bring to that task can become vectors for exploitation or attack. Unwittingly or otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="mitv-an-adversary-s-long-term-strategy">MiTV, An Adversary’s Long Term Strategy</h3>

<p>MiTV has long-term advantages for the adversary. It’s something he can <em>invest in</em> because it pays regular dividends in the long run. It provides persistent access to information and systems in a way that’s hard to prevent, hard to detect, hard to shut down, and hard to trace back to a particular moment in time. While the adversary is in the vendor and the vendor’s product is in your network he gathers sensitive information, collects credentials, and profiles users he can then target to further his mission. Or just bides his time, knowing that he can activate his implant at a time of his choosing. It’s for this reason that such programmes are so valuable to intelligence agencies and their existence remains such a closely guarded secret, even years after they’ve stopped producing operationally useful information.</p>

<p>The man in the vendor isn’t always a state or state-affiliated. However, they tend to be more patient, better funded, harder to detect, and more likely to be interested in <em>specific</em> information or a specific class of target than most. MiTV is a tactic employed by states with a tier-1 offensive cyber security capability. This means the US, UK, Russia, Israel, and of course China. This list isn’t exhaustive. My first MiTV was in the 90s and probably French. They were replacing router firmware with a modified version to gain access to a negotiating team within a large defence contractor. That said, attribution was then as it is now, <em>difficile</em>.</p>

<p>It’s these kinds of threats posed by these actors in general and (one presumes) China in particular that Dr Levy <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/the-future-of-telecoms-in-the-uk">said in January</a> could be countered with technical measures. Measures like limiting Huawei to peripheral (non-core) parts of the network. Measures like network segmentation, anomaly detection, and integrity checking. Measures presumably implemented and operated by security teams at national mobile network operators. Three, O2, Vodafone, and EE. Companies that despite the efforts of their security teams, are hacked <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers">regularly</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, individuals within security teams at mobile operators are drawn from the same pool of people that failed to even detect <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/apt10-continuing-target-uk-organisations">APT10’s</a> multi-year <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-cyber-cloudhopper/">Cloud Hopper</a> operation.</p>

<h3 id="the-odds">The Odds</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Cyber Security isn’t a numbers game, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190403010530/https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/03/03/chinas-hacker-army">Foreign Policy magazine</a> estimates China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cyberwarfare">“hacker army”</a> at between 50,000 and 100,000 people. It’s against this army that security teams at national mobile operators will be pitted. Are already pitted. Regardless of whether or not such an army is granted a strategic advantage by the presence of Huawei hardware and software. The supply chain to which they may or may not have special access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Installing 3rd party security solutions on top of mobile network assets (if such solutions were available, which they are not) offers no meaningful assurance against a MiTV. The first thing a MiTV does is prevent its detection by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210">subverting any direct method of observation</a>. Detecting a MiTV is a little like trying to spot a stealth aircraft using the “hole” in the picture where the object is, or the airflow disruption it leaves in its wake. Hard to sense directly. I’m highly critical of analogies in cyber security, so I won’t labour this one further. Suffice it to say that many MiTV operations have only been discovered because the “man” made a mistake. A slip-up. …</p></section></article></div></div>

    <div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>This month was a busy one, especially for our infrastructure. We purchased and received three refurbished Dell servers and one Cavium ThunderX server. Two of the three Dell servers were deployed. One is being used for our GitLab migration[1][2]. The second one is being set up as the HardenedBSD 14-CURRENT nightly build and package build server.</p>
<p>With the ThunderX server, we now have a production-capable arm64 server. I'm hoping that we can promote arm64 as a teir 1 architecture by the end of March. Though the server is deployed, I still need to copy the build scripts over and perform is final configuration.</p>
<p>FreeBSD recently landed a W^X implementation (congrats!), but it interferes with our PaX-inspired implementation. In addition to infrastructure work, I've been looking into this. I'm only able to reproduce when building packages--when there's a heavy load on the system. I'm working on some candiate patches, but they're not ready for commit.</p>
<p>The new package build server can be reached at [3]. The Tor onion service address is [4].</p>
<p>The next non-hackery item on my list is to reach out to 2020 donors that donated $250 USD or more to HardenedBSD. I need to give them their tax statement in case they itemize their taxes. I also need to reach out to recent donors to see if they want their name listed on our donations page.</p>
<p>I appreciate the help and support from the community. It's because of you that this project is possible. Your donations enable me to serve you.</p>

applicable parties:

You may not use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
and/or sell copies of the Software in a military or law enforcement context,
defined as follows:

1. A military context is a professional context where the intended application
of the Software is integration or use with or by military software, tools
(software or hardware), or personnel. This includes contractors and
subcontractors as well as research affiliates of any military organization.

2. A law enforcement context is a professional context where the intended
application of the Software is integration or use with or by law enforcement
software, tools (software or hardware), or personnel. This includes
contractors and subcontractors as well as research affiliates of any law
enforcement organization.

Entities that sell or license to military or law enforcement organizations
may use the Software under the original terms, but only in contexts that do
not assist or supplement the sold or licensed product.

Students and academics who are affiliated with research institutions may use
the Software under the original terms, but only in contexts that do not assist
or supplement collaboration or affiliation with any military or law
enforcement organization.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In plain English: if you work for the military (<em>any</em> military) or law enforcement
(<em>any</em> law enforcement), you will not be allowed to use my projects in a professional
setting. You may continue to use them in a <strong>personal</strong> setting with no restrictions.</p>

<p>If you work for a company that sells or licenses to a military or law enforcement
organization, you may continue to use my projects in professional settings that
are <em>not</em> connected to the settings in which you sell or license to those organizations.
Just as above, you may continue to use them under their original terms in a personal setting
with no restrictions.</p>

<p>If you are a student or academic at a research institution, you may continue to use my projects
in professional settings that are not connected to the work of your institution on
military or law enforcement contracts or programs. Just as above, you may continue to use them
under their original terms in a personal setting with no restrictions.</p>

<p>I’m not a lawyer, and I didn’t consult with one. I have no idea how enforceable this is.
You’re welcome to use it as well, provided that you understand that it could be legal nonsense.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">“Open source”?</h2>

<p>Like all definitions, “open source” is a convention. We get to choose what we make of it<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I’m okay with calling these terms “permissive” rather than “open,” but I’ll leave that
up to others to settle.</p>

<h2 id="what-about">What about…?</h2>

<p>I am painfully aware of the fact that millions of people are employed by the defense and law
enforcement industries, either directly, indirectly, or by proxy. I count myself as one of them.</p>

<p>I am aware that defense and law enforcement are functionally middle-class job programs and
are populated primarily by disaffected and myopic, not malicious, individuals. I realize
that these industries are frequently highly specialized and that individuals in these industries
may feel like they have no other recourse for their livelihoods.</p>

<p>I am also aware that I am a small fry. My (personal) projects are insignificant within the
greater pantheon of open source. I will continue to contribute to other projects under
their terms, advocating for modification of those terms when I believe it to be appropriate.</p>

<p>I plan to add a badge
<a href="https://raster.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20with%20restrictions-green.png">like this</a> to projects
that have been relicensed. My intent is to <strong>not</strong> sandbag users with new terms.</p>

<p>I act in spite of all of these things. I believe that I have a moral obligation to do so.
I believe that it is the <em>least</em> I can do, in the context of my hobby and passion. I will do more.</p>

<p>I’m happy to discuss it with you, reader. My contact information is
<a href="https://yossarian.net/">on my site</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, I would like to explore how missing input validation even in a trivial service
can leave parts of server infrastructure crumbling.</p><p>In my opinion, this why securing applications (AppSec) is very difficult. Put supply chain attacks, unpatched systems
and misconfiguring services to one side for a minute and consider that a lot of software is written by
developers who do not necessarily consider all the edge cases or implications of what can go
wrong even in the simplest of pieces of code (or just copy/paste from Stackoverflow).<br>Unfortunately, vulnerable software in all sectors can get rushed out due to deadlines or inexperience
and it is my opinion that poor coding practices in applications provide an interesting attack vector
everywhere.</p><p>Allow me to demonstrate: Given the following (admittedly oversimplified) problem statement:</p><blockquote><p>Write a microservice that increments a decimal number by one</p></blockquote><p>Keeping it simple and very generic, I came up with the following Spring Boot application:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2

</span><span> 4

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>A reasonable implementation. I even used <code>BigDecimal</code> so that I don’t have rounding/precision
issues, and the service is pretty trivial:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl http://localhost:8080/increment <span>\
</span><span></span>  -d <span>'{"number":1}'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  -H <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span>
<span>{</span><span>"number"</span>:2<span>}</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>As it turns out - quite a bit.</p><p>Here is a view of what the CPU did on my mac after hitting the service with a few requests over
a 10-minute period:</p><p><img src="https://beny23.github.io/images/one_plus_one_is_crash_cpu_stats.png" alt=""></p><p>And here’s the memory:</p><p><img src="https://beny23.github.io/images/one_plus_one_is_crash_memory_stats.png" alt=""></p><p>And what was the culprit. Not a vulnerability in Sprint Boot, not thousands of requests
(as a matter of fact there were just 4 requests, you can see it in the CPU graph, each time another request
came in, another CPU was used up 100%).</p><p>The requests were just:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl http://localhost:8080/increment <span>\
</span><span></span>  -d <span>'{"number":9999999e99999999}'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  -H <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The number <code>9999999e99999999</code> has near enough <code>10,000,000</code> digits. If I wanted to send such
a number without the scientific notation (the <code>e</code> in the number), I’d have to send a payload that’s
many 10 megabytes big. That would get noticed very quickly. However, the payload is miniscule. And when java
is calculating this number (the plus 1 operation), it takes a long time because it tries to make an exact calculation.
I didn’t wait around to find out how long the CPU was busy. I just killed the
program after 10 minutes.</p><p>Imagine how much havoc such a vulnerability can create in a cloud setting, where instances sit in
Auto Scaling Groups. Imagine 100 such requests hit your instances. Every time we get 100% CPU, we
spin up another instance, that’s expensive. And as the processing also uses up quite a bit of memory,
it’s very likely that other requests don’t get a look-in.</p><p>This makes a very effective Denial of Service attack. Sure, when identified it is easy enough to fix by
not allowing the scientific notation understood by <code>BigDecimal</code> as input to JSON, but that’s not provided
as standard. How can you be sure that your codebase isn’t vulnerable?</p><p>In my opinion this is where development and testing teams need to have the experience in spotting these
potential issues. The above is just one example of how a seemingly innocuous piece of code can be abused.</p><p>How would your code fare against the <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings">Big List of Naughty Strings</a>?</p><ul></ul></div></div>]]>

            <p>To sign kids up for our city’s Little League baseball program, you have to prove that they’re residents, which is reasonable. What’s not reasonable is the amount of information you have to provide on the registration website. You have to upload scans of a document in each of 3 categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proof of Residency 1</strong>
Choose one of the following: Driver’s license, School records, Vehicle records, Employment records, Insurance documents</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Residency 2</strong>
Choose one of the following: Welfare/child care records, Federal records, State records, Local records, Support payment records, Homeowner or tenant records, Military records</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Residency 3</strong>
Choose one of the following: Voter’s registration, Utility bills, Financial records, Medical records, Internet, cable, or satellite bills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That alone is ripe for identity theft, but couple it with their privacy policy which includes this (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without limitation, this typically requires the use of certain personal information, including registration data, event data, and other personal information, to provide program information, <strong>special offers or services through Little League and/or its trusted sponsors, partners, or licensees</strong>, to fulfill your requests for information or products/services, to maintain a list of verified and eligible participants, to maintain a list of volunteers and provide them with the operating tools to manage leagues, or to respond to your inquiries about our programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, you have to upload your most private information and agree to allow them to do as they like with it, including sharing it with whomever they like for any reason they choose.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>It seems like everybody needs software engineers. Demand is much higher than supply. This translates to jobs with good pay and lots of options to choose from. Want a full-time job? Startup job with equity? Remote contract work with 3 months off every year? No problem!</p>
<p>When I was just beginning to learn about programming, I wondered whether there would always be a need for millions and millions of programmers.</p>
<p>After my 15 years in the industry it looks like the demand is going nowhere. Some stats from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">US Department of Labor</a>:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>Job Outlook, 2019-29 is 22% (much faster than average). The average growth rate for all occupations is 4 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the United Kingdom alone, there are now <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2018/04/06/uk-technology-start-ups-hit-all-time-high/#5654d1415d85">10k technology startups</a>.</p>
<p>Here are my observations on why that is:</p>
<h3>1. The whole world runs on&nbsp;software</h3>
<p>This is probably obvious because the transition has been ongoing for a few generations. However, it cannot be understated. Almost every business / organisation in the world needs a website or an app, plus lots of software. At my current company with 80 employees we use more than 20 different SaaS solutions for HR, accounting, recruiting and more. Every person with internet access (which eventually will be the whole world) uses apps and websites every day, and many people use software at work. Large companies often need custom software.</p>
<h3>2. Most things get built many&nbsp;times</h3>
<p>Why is there Bing when there is Google? Why are there a thousand competing e-commerce platforms? Why are there so many messaging apps, each built from scratch by a different team? This seems like duplicated effort but it’s normal. It’s just how competition works and it is not unique to software. For example, there are many car companies, each with tens of thousands of employees designing and building very similar cars.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is software is still local. There is “X of Asia” for almost any X you can think of.</p>
<h3>3. Code has limited&nbsp;lifetime</h3>
<p>It might seem that once an app is built it is “done”. When I worked at Facebook friends asked me “Is there still anything to do?” However, most code is being changed constantly and most companies are constantly hiring. Each line of code has a lifetime of only a few years. Sometimes as a product gets old it is easier to throw it away and rebuild using modern technologies. I have seen this happen to custom in-house systems and public-facing websites. This is again similar to car companies constantly innovating and designing new cars.</p>
<p>From the 3 points above you can already see a clear pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need more and more software</li>
<li>There are more and more software solutions to do anything</li>
<li>Each solution requires software engineers constantly</li>
</ul>
<p>But what if programming becomes easier over time? Surely we would need fewer programmers then? Read on…</p>
<h3>4. Code sharing didn’t&nbsp;happen</h3>
<p>In the 90s there was a dream of code sharing, where we design software components with business logic inside them and anyone will be able to reuse them like lego bricks. This didn’t work out, not even reusing business logic across projects written in Java. Across technology stacks, the story is even worse. There was COM but it was Windows-only. Yes, you can call Rust from Python but it’s not become the standard way of building software. There are many programming languages and new ones keep appearing. At my last company for example, we rewrote a part of an existing codebase from Ruby to Rust.</p>
<p>Code reuse did improve over the years thanks to package managers, GitHub and an explosion of open source libraries. Systems like npm are a huge step forward. However, we came nowhere near the dream of true code sharing. Open source libraries help a lot but not enough to significantly slow the demand for engineers.</p>
<h3>5. Tools are improving but projects are getting more&nbsp;complex</h3>
<p>Using a language with a garbage collector in a modern IDE with lots of libraries and going “serverless” is more productive than writing C++ in 1995. Can you now hire five times fewer engineers than in 1995 for the same project? Probably. But instead, it’s more likely you hire the same number of engineers and the project will be more ambitious because customers came to expect more.</p>
<h3>6. New platforms come&nbsp;out</h3>
<p>Ten years ago it was enough to hire web developers. Now you need to hire web, Android and iOS developers. Depending on your product, you may also build Messenger bots and WeChat apps.</p>
<p>The biggest step forward here was probably the web. Suddenly you didn’t have to build a Mac, Linux, and Windows desktop apps but could just build your product in JavaScript and then it would work anywhere (minus browser incompatibilities, this got better over time). The fact web standards happened is a small miracle — remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Browser Wars</a>? However, because of mobile, the web is now less relevant than it was 10 years ago. Today, frameworks like Unity, React Native or Flutter are trying to abstract over multiple platforms to make software development easier and cheaper.</p>
<h3>7. Extra (for fun): AI to replace software engineers?</h3>
<p>Imagine someone designs software that can replace most engineers. For example, instead of a team of 6 engineers, there would be one human “tech lead” who specifies high-level requirements and the program translates them into bug-free code.</p>
<p>No-one has a good idea when this could happen. If it happens the demand for engineers would drop immensely. But with such technology the demand for humans in other professions would likely drop too, so relative to other professions programming <em>might</em> still be in demand.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

    <p>
This is a big deal.
</p>

<p>
In my day job I work with images captured by cameras, using those images to
infer something about the geometry of the scene being observed. Naturally, to
get good results you need to have a good estimate of the behavior of the lens
(the "intrinsics"), and of the relative geometry of the cameras (the
"extrinsics"; if there's more than one camera).
</p>

<p>
The usual way to do this is to perform a "calibration" procedure to compute the
intrinsics and extrinsics, and then to use the resulting "camera model" to
process the subsequent images. Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_resectioning">an article</a>. And from experience,
the most common current toolkit to do this appears to be <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html">OpenCV</a>.
</p>

<p>
People have been doing this for a while, but for whatever reason the existing
tools <i>all</i> suck. They make basic questions like "how much data should I gather
for a calibration?" and "how good is this calibration I just computed?" and "how
different are these two models?" unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
This is clearly seen from the links above. The wikipedia article talks about
fitting a pinhole model to lenses, even though no real lenses follow this model
(telephoto lenses do somewhat; wider lenses don't at all).
</p>

<p>
And the OpenCV tutorial cheerfully says that
</p>

<pre>Re-projection error gives a good estimation of just how exact the found
parameters are. The closer the re-projection error is to zero, the more accurate
the parameters we found are.
</pre>

<p>
This statement is trivially proven false: throw away most of your calibration
data, and your reprojection error becomes very low. But we can all agree that a
calibration computed from less data is actually worse. Right?
</p>

<p>
All the various assumptions and hacks in the existing tooling are fine as long
as you don't need a whole lot of accuracy out of your results. I need a lot of
accuracy, however, so all the existing tools don't work for my applications.
</p>

<p>
So I built a new set of tools, and have been using them with great delight. I
just got the blessing to do a public release, so I'm announcing it here. The
tools are
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dkogan/mrgingham">mrgingham</a>: a chessboard corner finder. OpenCV has one, but as far as I can
tell, it doesn't work; and it is very slow to tell you that. mrgingham is
relatively quick, robust to all sorts of lens behaviors, and reports the
accuracy of its output. This is a C++ library with Python bindings, and a
commandline tool. 99% of the time the commandline tool is what I use.
</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal">mrcal</a>: a large toolkit to run calibrations, to manipulate images and camera
models in all sorts of ways, and to visualize stuff. This toolkit does a
<i>lot</i>. It's a C library and a Python library and a number of commandline
tools. Currently the C library exists primarily in the service of the other
two, but it's already very capable, and will become more so over time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
mrcal does a whole lot to produce calibrations that are as good as possible, and
it will tell you just how good they are, and it includes visualization
capabilities for extensive user feedback. An overview of the capabilities of the
toolkit (with lots of pretty pictures!) is at the <a href="http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/tour.html">tour of mrcal.</a>
</p>

<p>
There's a <i>lot</i> of documentation and examples, but up to now I have been the
primary user of the tools. So I expect this to be somewhat rough when others
look at it. Bug reports and patches are welcome.
</p>

<p>
mrcal is an excellent base, but it's nowhere near "done". The documentation has
some notes about the planned features and improvements, and I'm always reachable
by email.
</p>

<p>
Let me know if you try it out!
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h5>Austen Allred is the CEO and founder of Lambda School, a unique coding school that pioneered the ‘income-sharing agreement’ (ISA) model, whereby students only pay if they’re hired in their field of study. Lambda came out of incubator Y Combinator, before which he lived in his two-door Honda Civic and scalped soccer tickets at Stanford Stadium to get by. Prior to Bay Area entrepreneurship, he did a two-year mission to the Ukraine where he learned Russian and knocked on lots of doors. The interview was conducted via Zoom with Austen in Southern Utah, from where he routinely tweets out enviable photography of Utah’s stunning landscape.</h5><p><strong>Your posts are some of the most uplifting things in my feed. They’re either screenshots from an internal Slack or a retweet, and it’s a Lambda student saying: I went from making $20,000 in some service job, and now I'm making $80,000/year doing something technical at (say) Cisco, and you've totally changed my life. </strong></p><p><strong>One thing you often post that I think isn’t obvious to people who don't run a socio-economic escalator is all the necessary polish and look-and-feel of being part of the bougie techie class. For example, how you have this email protocol to set up a meeting. Or that if you think you're underpaid, you go in and you say, </strong><em><strong>screw you, pay me more or I leave</strong></em><strong>. It's intriguing that you don’t only have to educate them to turn them into front end engineers, you also have to teach them the social skills around that to become that bougie techie person.</strong></p><p>That's one of the really weird things: The hiring process is not just a filter for skills, it's also a filter for class. And people don't talk about or acknowledge that. It's very clear in all these protocols that we have in tech that you and I understand, you have to learn them the hard way. I'll give you a couple of examples. When I was in sixth grade, I was selling stuff on eBay. I was just this kid trying to hustle, and I had this mentor/entrepreneur who came into high school every now and then and just talked with us. And I was like, okay, real talk! What do I need to do to be taken seriously, because nobody takes me seriously because I'm a 15-year-old kid? And he sat me down and he said: <em>We are going to start using this thing called Gmail</em>. <em>I'm going to send you an invite, and you're going to set up firstname.lastname@gmail.com, no numbers, no nonsense, nothing else, you're going to have no signature, and you're only ever going to send text emails for the rest of your life.</em> <em>That's step one</em>. He just walked me through all this really, really basic stuff. </p><p>There was this other time I was in college…I was hustling and trying to get into startups and there was this guy at a conference I wanted to work with, so I went up and talked to him. And I said <em>what can I do to be like you? </em>He gave me his business card and said <em>just ping me next week</em>. </p><p>I spent hours and hours and hours looking up what <em>ping me</em> meant. I couldn't find anything. So eventually I called somebody and said <em>hey, this guy said ping me. What does that mean?</em> <em>How do I ping? </em>And that person was like, <em>no, no, it’s a call or an email or anything really, just reach out to them. Doesn’t matter how.</em> <em>That's all that ping means</em>. <em>You know, like a cell tower. Ping!</em> I was like, <em>ohhhhhhhh!</em> There's so much little stuff like that. Another classic example is intros, right? Or using Google Calendar. I didn't know how to use Google Calendar until I showed up in my first job. Someone tells me, <em>I am gonna put some time on your calendar</em>. And I think: <em>Oh, I guess I have a calendar</em>. That's not obvious if you don't come from, frankly, a certain class. But all of those things are important; if you don't intro somebody the right way to a VC, they know you're a dunce, automatically. There’s nobody that sits you down and says <em>hey, you're gonna say thank you so-and-so, moving you to BCC</em>. It's not hard, but nobody ever tells you that anywhere.</p><h4>I've heard it described as ‘the bottom 1000 universities’: Assume there's some algorithm that spits out the combination of <em>is expensive</em> and <em>is ineffective</em>. There are at least 1000 universities in the US that should cease to exist. There are many universities that net do more harm than good.</h4><p><strong>There's no tech charm school that teaches you how to do all that stuff.</strong></p><p>Totally. And I'm sure there's more stuff. When one of our first students got hired at Uber, he showed up with his laptop. They tell him: <em>you're a mobile developer</em>. And he's like, <em>I can't be a mobile developer, I don't have a phone</em>. He didn't have a smartphone. So he called me freaking out: <em>What am I gonna do!? Uber wants to hire me. I don't have a smartphone.</em> I told him: <em>Uber does not care about that, Uber’s gonna have a thousand phones, that's the least of Uber’s worries. They're gonna give you a laptop too.</em> </p><p>Then he shows up to work on day one and they tell him: <em>Alright, you know, put in your bank account information here to get direct deposit.</em> He's like, <em>no just cut me a check and I’ll run to the check-cashing store.</em> </p><p>The Uber people reached out to me and said: <em>We don’t know if this is going to work.</em> I was like, <em>he's a smart guy, it’s just that he doesn't have a bank account</em>. So now we set up bank accounts for every student that doesn't have a bank account. The best way I think to describe Lambda School is the American-Dream-as-a-service. </p><p><strong>Wow. That’s the corporate anthem right there.</strong></p><p>(Laughs.)</p><p><strong>There so much cultural encoding in an interview which, as you said, is just filtering for class. But…as these are technical people, there’s actually an objective standard of merit. </strong></p><p>There are a whole swath of white collar jobs that the interview process literally is like, <em>Hey, I'm gonna play a little verbal tennis with you and see if you can stand your ground and if you can, you get the job</em>. That's probably the average white collar job.</p><h4>That's one of the really weird things: The hiring process is not just a filter for skills, it's also a filter for class. And people don't talk about or acknowledge that. </h4><p><strong>Speaking of other jobs, do you see Lambda expanding to other fields? Is that even possible? </strong></p><p><strong>The thing that obviously aligns incentives is to look at education as a hard-nosed business proposition. I'm sure you personally care, but the reason why you care as a business owner is because you want them to get the job because otherwise you're not gonna get paid, right? You’ve invested a year and a half in this person, and they can't blow it up because they don’t know about direct deposits, so you fix that. Which is good, and certainly a lot better than the business model universities have. But that model only works if there's some pretty predictable future stream of income along with pretty predictable employment demand. Can you imagine non-technical professions like trucking and nursing that have high demand and high wages? </strong></p><p>The cool thing about the incentive alignment is that we're not going to train you to be a sociologist, because it just doesn't work. A common critique of the ISA model is: <em>oh, now people aren't going to study poetry anymore.</em> And my response to that is: <em>yeah, we're not a university, we're a trade school</em>. The university has 18 million things that it does for you, and we cut cut off a tiny sliver of that, which is: we're going to help you get a better job, we're going to help you improve your state in life. That's all we do. </p><p>There are actually more high-paying jobs available than there are people to fill those roles. And that's true all over the place. I think about it as an optimization problem. You've got all this latent human potential, and it's just kind of bouncing around. Sometimes it goes to school, and it picks stuff at random to study, and you know what you know because of who you’re surrounded by.</p><p>One aspect of Lambda School that I think is underappreciated is a whole lot of people come in having no idea of what software is, having no idea that there's such a thing as a software engineer. We have people who join and think it's like, <em>I'm gonna fix printers</em>. They know that tech is a high-paying field, but they're not surrounded it. If you're in the inner city, or in a rural area, you don't know a computer programmer. </p><p>One way to think about Lambda is like fintech: You have all these transactions that are moving all over the place, but what makes it all work is a clearinghouse that moves all the money to where it needs to go. I think of Lambda as kind of an economic clearinghouse: Here's all of the untapped human potential, here's all the would-be labor, and over here’s all the jobs that need to be done. There's nothing connecting the two right now other than sheer happenstance and going to university, or maybe you hear that there's a good job over here somewhere.</p><p>But right now the situation is not: <em>I'm making $50k, here's my skill set and my interest, I want to make $90k</em>. Somebody should be able to tell you how to do that, and right now, nobody can. That’s crazy. More than half of GDP is just people working, and that's completely unoptimized. </p><p><strong>Right. Even I, who came from a middle-class background and went to the university track, it seemed like a recently poorly-managed process and I only ended up in science and technology by sheer happenstance…</strong></p><p>You stumbled in, yeah? I feel the same way, and the interesting thing now is, depending on which way you happen to stumble, you can end up fabulously rich or destitute based on your stumblings. </p><h4>The other broken piece is the notion that you go to school once for 10 years when you're 18, and you'll be able to ride that for the rest of your career. That’s probably false for a whole lot of people.</h4><p><strong>So this model you’re describing, where you basically connect people from one income level to another higher one via various different processes. I’m curious what other connections you can imagine existing. </strong></p><p>The way to answer that is to see where all the shortages are, where are people trying to hire and those people don’t exist? Tech is an obvious one, but it’s all over the place in …</p></div></div>

<p>I know my setup is dated but what on <em>earth</em> could take 6x longer to load into online mode? I couldn’t measure any difference using the story-to-online loading technique <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/kycy7a/gtao_loading_times_using_different_methods/">as others have found before me</a>. Even if it did work the results would be down in the noise.</p>
<h2 id="I-Am-Not-Alone"><a href="#I-Am-Not-Alone" title="I Am (Not) Alone"></a>I Am (Not) Alone</h2><p>If <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/ht4i56/your_average_online_loading_time/">this poll</a> is to be trusted then the issue is widespread enough to mildly annoy more than 80% of the player base. It’s been 7 years R*!</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-0.png" alt="🎵What does the poll say?🎵"></p>
<p>Looking around a bit to find who are the lucky ~20% that get sub 3 minute load times I came across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCqDdjp6iU">a</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJzr3qfyCyg">few</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK7BUFx_NGk">benchmarks</a> with high-end gaming PCs and an online mode load time of about 2 minutes. I would <del>kill</del> <em>hack</em> for a 2 minute load time! It does seem to be hardware-dependent but something doesn’t add up here…</p>
<p>How come their story mode still takes near a minute to load? (The M.2 one didn’t count the startup logos btw.) Also, loading story to online takes them only a minute more while I’m getting about five more. I know that their hardware specs are a lot better but surely not 5x better.</p>
<h2 id="Highly-accurate-measurements"><a href="#Highly-accurate-measurements" title="Highly accurate measurements"></a>Highly accurate measurements</h2><p>Armed with such powerful tools as <em>the Task Manager</em> I began to investigate what resources could be the bottleneck.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-1.png" alt="Can you smell it?"></p>
<p>After taking a minute to load the common resources used for both story and online modes (which is near on par with high-end PCs) GTA decides to max out a single core on my machine for four minutes and do nothing else.</p>
<p>Disk usage? None! Network usage? There’s a bit, but it drops basically to zero after a few seconds (apart from loading the rotating info banners). GPU usage? Zero. Memory usage? Completely flat…</p>
<p>What, is it mining crypto or something? I smell code. <em>Really bad code</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Single-thread-bound"><a href="#Single-thread-bound" title="Single thread-bound"></a>Single thread-bound</h2><p>While my old AMD CPU has 8 cores and it does pack a punch, it was made in the olden days. Back when AMD’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://valid.x86.fr/bench/6u7sdy/1">single-thread performance</a> was <em>way</em> behind Intel’s. This might not explain all of the load time differences but it should explain most of it.</p>
<p>What’s odd is that it’s using up <em>just</em> the CPU. I was expecting vast amounts of disk reads loading up resources or loads of network requests trying to negotiate a session in the p2p network. But this? This is probably a bug.</p>
<h2 id="Profiling"><a href="#Profiling" title="Profiling"></a>Profiling</h2><p>Profilers are a great way of finding CPU bottlenecks. There’s only one problem - most of them rely on instrumenting the source code to get a perfect picture of what’s happening in the process. And I don’t have the source code. Nor do I need microsecond-perfect readings - I have 4 minutes’ worth of a bottleneck.</p>
<p>Enter stack sampling: for closed source applications there’s only one option. Dump the running process’ stack and current instruction pointer’s location to build a calling tree in set intervals. Then add them up to get statistics on what’s going on. There’s only one profiler that I know of (might be ignorant here) that can do this on Windows. And it hasn’t been updated in over 10 years. It’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://lukestackwalker.sourceforge.net/">Luke Stackwalker</a>! Someone, please give this project some love :)</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-2.png" alt="The power of statistics compels you!"></p>
<p>Normally Luke would group the same functions together but since I don’t have debugging symbols I had to eyeball nearby addresses to guess if it’s the same place. And what do we see? Not one bottleneck but two of them!</p>
<h2 id="Down-the-rabbit-hole"><a href="#Down-the-rabbit-hole" title="Down the rabbit hole"></a>Down the rabbit hole</h2><p>Having borrowed <em>my friend’s</em> completely legitimate copy of <em>the industry-standard disassembler</em> (no, I really can’t afford the thing… gonna learn to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">ghidra</a> one of these days) I went to take GTA apart.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-3.png" alt="Gibberish Galore"></p>
<p>That doesn’t look right at all. Most high-profile games come with built-in protection against reverse engineering to keep away pirates, cheaters, and modders. Not that it has ever stopped them.</p>
<p>There seems to be some sort of an obfuscation/encryption at play here that has replaced most instructions with gibberish. Not to worry, we simply need to dump the game’s memory while it’s executing the part we want to look at. The instructions have to be de-obfuscated before running one way or another. I had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/glmcdona/Process-Dump">Process Dump</a> lying around, so I used that, but there are plenty of other tools available to do this sort of thing.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-one-It’s…-strlen"><a href="#Problem-one-It’s…-strlen" title="Problem one: It’s… strlen?!"></a>Problem one: It’s… strlen?!</h2><p>Disassembling the now-less-obfuscated dump reveals that one of the addresses has a label pulled out of somewhere! It’s <code>strlen</code>? Going down the call stack the next one is labeled <code>vscan_fn</code> and after that the labels end, tho I’m fairly confident it’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/blob/master/pal/src/safecrt/sscanf.c#L47"><code>sscanf</code></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-4.png" alt="A graph a day keeps the skeptics away"></p>
<p>It’s parsing something. Parsing what? Untangling the disassembly would take forever so I decided to dump some samples from the running process using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x64dbg.com/">x64dbg</a>. Some debug-stepping later it turns out it’s… JSON! They’re parsing JSON. A whopping <strong>10 megabytes</strong> worth of JSON with some <strong>63k item entries</strong>.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>...,</span><br><span>{</span><br><span>    <span>"key"</span>: <span>"WP_WCT_TINT_21_t2_v9_n2"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"price"</span>: <span>45000</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"statName"</span>: <span>"CHAR_KIT_FM_PURCHASE20"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"storageType"</span>: <span>"BITFIELD"</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"bitShift"</span>: <span>7</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"bitSize"</span>: <span>1</span>,</span><br><span>    <span>"category"</span>: [<span>"CATEGORY_WEAPON_MOD"</span>]</span><br><span>},</span><br><span>...</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>What is it? It appears to be data for a “net shop catalog” according to some references. I assume it contains a list of all the possible items and upgrades you can buy in GTA Online.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing up some confusion: I beleive these are in-game money purchasable items, not directly linked with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Cash_Cards">microtransactions</a>.</strong></p>
<p>But 10 megs? That’s nothing! And using <code>sscanf</code> may not be optimal but surely it’s not that bad? Well…</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-5.png" alt="Ouch!"></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s gonna take a while… To be fair I had no idea most <code>sscanf</code> implementations called <code>strlen</code> so I can’t blame the developer who wrote this. I would assume it just scanned byte by byte and could stop on a <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-two-Let’s-use-a-Hash-…-Array"><a href="#Problem-two-Let’s-use-a-Hash-…-Array" title="Problem two: Let’s use a Hash- … Array?"></a>Problem two: Let’s use a Hash- … Array?</h2><p>Turns out the second offender is called right next to the first one. They’re both even called in the same <code>if</code> statement as seen in this ugly decompilation:</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-6.png" alt="Beggar thy neighbour"></p>
<p>All labels are mine, no idea what the functions/parameters are actually called.</p>
<p>The second problem? Right after parsing an item, it’s stored in an array (or an inlined C++ list? not sure). Each entry looks something like this:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>struct</span> {</span></span><br><span>    <span>uint64_t</span> *hash;</span><br><span>    <span>item_t</span>   *item;</span><br><span>} entry;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>But before it’s stored? It checks the <em>entire</em> array, one by one, comparing the hash of the item to see if it’s in the list or not. With ~63k entries that’s <code>(n^2+n)/2 = (63000^2+63000)/2 = 1984531500</code> checks if my math is right. Most of them useless. You have unique <em>hashes</em> why not use a <em>hash map</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://nee.lv/images/pasted-7.png" alt="Oof!"></p>
<p>I named it <code>hashmap</code> while reversing but it’s clearly <code>not_a_hashmap</code>. And it gets even better. The hash-array-list-thing is empty before loading the JSON. And all of the items in the JSON are unique! They don’t even <em>need</em> to check if it’s in the list or not! They even have a function to directly insert the items! Just use that! Srsly, WAT!?</p>
<h2 id="PoC"><a href="#PoC" title="PoC"></a>PoC</h2><p>Now that’s nice and all, but no one is going to take me seriously unless I test this so I can write a clickbait title for the post.</p>
<p>The plan? Write a <code>.dll</code>, inject it in GTA, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook">hook</a> some functions, ???, profit.</p>
<p>The JSON problem is hairy, I can’t realistically replace their parser. Replacing <code>sscanf</code> with one that doesn’t depend on <code>strlen</code> would be more realistic. But there’s an even easier way.</p>
<ul>
<li>hook strlen</li>
<li>wait for a long string</li>
<li>“cache” the start and length of it</li>
<li>if it’s called again within the string’s range, return cached value</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like:</p>

<p>And as for the hash-array problem, it’s more straightforward - just skip the duplicate checks entirely and insert the items directly since we know the values are unique.</p>

<p>Hell yes, it did! :))</p>
<p>Most likely, this won’t solve everyone’s load times - there might be other bottlenecks on different systems, but it’s such a gaping hole that I have no idea how R* has missed it all these years.</p>

<p><a href="https://mattj.io/posts/">Click here to go to all posts</a>. <em>Also published on <a href="https://mattjoseph.medium.com/create-animated-gif-and-webp-from-videos-using-ffmpeg-f1012267935a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a></em></p>

<p><em>A guide to using FFmpeg to create all the animated content you want.</em></p>

<p>Whether it’s for a website, a presentation, or sharing a fun clip with a friend on chat, you might want to convert a video to an animated GIF or animated WebP. Unfortunately, the visual tools for doing this vary by your operating system. Additionally, most conversion tools don’t support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the WebP format</a>, even in 2021. WebP is based on VP8, a relatively recent video codec standard compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIF image format</a>.</p>

<p>So, this guide is for those who are willing to learn a bit of terminal in order to convert any video to the animated format of their choosing. The best part: this will work on all major operating systems and gives you all the control of the output you could want!</p>


<figcaption>Example GIF of typing "GIF" on a mechanical keyboard</figcaption>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To use this guide, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic knowledge of how to open and use the terminal on your operating system. If you need a cheat sheet or introductory guides, check out <a href="https://terminalcheatsheet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terminal Cheat Sheet</a>.</li>
  <li>FFmpeg v4+ installed on your operating system and executable from your path. Here are some suggested places to learn down to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>macOS: <a href="https://superuser.com/a/624562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://superuser.com/a/624562</a></li>
      <li>Windows: <a href="https://video.stackexchange.com/a/20496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://video.stackexchange.com/a/20496</a></li>
      <li>Linux: Use your preferred package manager (e.g., <code>sudo apt install ffmpeg</code> on Ubuntu)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-isffmpeg">What is&nbsp;FFmpeg?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For our purposes, we will use it to convert between formats, such as videos to GIFs or animated WebP. It has many uses, so I recommend checking it out for all your video processing needs!</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start-make-sure-you-can-run-ffmpeg-from-yourterminal">Before you start: make sure you can run FFmpeg from your&nbsp;terminal</h2>

<p>Since all of these commands require FFmpeg, we need to make sure it’s available.</p>

<p>Open your terminal, and run this:</p>



<p>If FFmpeg is available, you will note output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>FFmpeg version 4.3.1 Copyright © 2000–2020 the FFmpeg developers
...
</code></pre></div></div>


<figcaption>Checking the FFmpeg version on Linux</figcaption>

<p>Version 4 or higher of FFmpeg is recommended for this guide.</p>

<p>If you get an output that says something similar to <code>command not found: ffmpeg -version</code>, then check the <strong>Prerequisites</strong> section above and make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system.</p>

<h2 id="when-should-i-use-an-animated-gif-versus-an-animatedwebp">When should I use an animated GIF versus an animated&nbsp;WebP?</h2>

<p>This depends on the quality, size, and support you want for your output. Modern browsers have support for animated WebP and the quality tends to be higher, but the processing power required is also higher.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>This guide serves as a brief introduction to using FFmpeg to create an animated GIF or animated WebP from a video, but there is so much more you can do with the tool. There are also many options that FFmpeg supports for these formats that are not covered.</p>

February 28, 2021 | https://manuelmoreale.com/a-minimal-browser | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://manuelmoreale.com/a-minimal-browser">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/"></a><p>As a web developer I have a love &amp; hate relationship with browsers. On one side, I need them to function properly in order to do my job, on the other I want them to be as minimal as possible. At the same time I’m trying to spend less and more meaningful time on the browser which is why I decided to minimize it. I’m on a Mac and I decided to use Safari as my primary browser. Now, before you start screaming at the screen, I know what you’re thinking: Safari is awful. And I don’t disagree with that. Being awful is a plus. I don’t want to be comfortable, I want my browser to behave badly which is why Safari, with all its weird and stupid bugs is perfect. My safari looks like this:</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/a3cde09051-1611495857/safari-1.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/a3cde09051-1611495857/safari-1-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/a3cde09051-1611495857/safari-1-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/a3cde09051-1611495857/safari-1-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/a3cde09051-1611495857/safari-1-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div><figcaption>pretty minimal...</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s how the taskbar is set up if you’re curious and want to do it yourself.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2435099ee2-1611495857/safari-2.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2435099ee2-1611495857/safari-2-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2435099ee2-1611495857/safari-2-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2435099ee2-1611495857/safari-2-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2435099ee2-1611495857/safari-2-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div><figcaption>GTFO icons!</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, I removed pretty much everything. Only thing left is the search bar at the center. I can use gestures and the keyboard to navigate through tabs and go back and forth through the history so I don’t need any button at the top. I’m also trying to have as fewer tabs open as possible. This is something that’s part of my commitment to be digitally minimal.</p>
<h2>Few extra settings</h2>
<p>In addition to the minimal taskbar, there are a couple of extra steps I took in order to have a more minimalist browser.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2ce9f2c4d0-1611495857/safari-3.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2ce9f2c4d0-1611495857/safari-3-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2ce9f2c4d0-1611495857/safari-3-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2ce9f2c4d0-1611495857/safari-3-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/2ce9f2c4d0-1611495857/safari-3-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Both new windows and tabs open on a blank page. That’s because I don’t want to get distracted by icons. If I open the browser I want to stay focused on the current task and not browse mindlessly.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/5bf1323c1b-1611495857/safari-4.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/5bf1323c1b-1611495857/safari-4-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/5bf1323c1b-1611495857/safari-4-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/5bf1323c1b-1611495857/safari-4-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/5bf1323c1b-1611495857/safari-4-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>I’m also loading a custom css file, which I use to hide stuff from websites I use somewhat regularly. It’s used primarily to hide parts of the sites, change the typography or the colors. Nothing super crazy but definitely helpful.</p>
<h2>What about the other browsers</h2>
<p>A yes, the other browsers. We’re talking about Firefox and Chrome right?  Chrome is my dev browser because Safari’s webtools are frankly a pile of hot garbage. My Chrome looks like this:</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/b8c3d35836-1611495857/chrome-1.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/b8c3d35836-1611495857/chrome-1-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/b8c3d35836-1611495857/chrome-1-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/b8c3d35836-1611495857/chrome-1-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/b8c3d35836-1611495857/chrome-1-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>The new tab is a custom extension I coded months ago. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-new-page/danoojfpckpaacgbaebfakjeepeenaop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It’s available for free on the Chrome App store</a> or whatever is called. You can’t really remove many things from Chrome. All the extensions are hidden, home icon is obviously gone but other than that it looks pretty much like a normal Chrome installation.</p>
<p>Firefox is a bit more interesting. I don’t use Firefox a lot to be honest with you even though has got much better lately and I quite like it as a browser. Still, if it’s your primary browser and you want to minimize it, this is what you can do. My Firefox looks like this:</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/d4c53b9400-1611495857/ff-1.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/d4c53b9400-1611495857/ff-1-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/d4c53b9400-1611495857/ff-1-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/d4c53b9400-1611495857/ff-1-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/d4c53b9400-1611495857/ff-1-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>As you can see, almost everything is gone from the sidebar. Only things you can’t remove are the two arrows but I moved one of the two on the opposite side in order to have a less busy left corner. Only other thing left is the search bar.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/f442c2e48d-1611495857/ff-2.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/f442c2e48d-1611495857/ff-2-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/f442c2e48d-1611495857/ff-2-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/f442c2e48d-1611495857/ff-2-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/f442c2e48d-1611495857/ff-2-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>I’m also using the dark color scheme. You can change the theme down at the bottom of the customization page.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/638f8831f7-1611495857/ff-3.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/638f8831f7-1611495857/ff-3-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/638f8831f7-1611495857/ff-3-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/638f8831f7-1611495857/ff-3-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/638f8831f7-1611495857/ff-3-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>As for the settings, like I did for Safari, an empty page is shown every time I open a new tab or window. This is super helpful to cut down distractions.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/cba5cf6b18-1611495857/ff-4.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/cba5cf6b18-1611495857/ff-4-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/cba5cf6b18-1611495857/ff-4-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/cba5cf6b18-1611495857/ff-4-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/cba5cf6b18-1611495857/ff-4-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Another thing you can do is turn off those obnoxious notifications requests. To do that you need to go in the Privacy &amp; Security section inside the settings and click on the Settings... button next to Notifications.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/e3598d4a06-1611495857/ff-5.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/e3598d4a06-1611495857/ff-5-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/e3598d4a06-1611495857/ff-5-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/e3598d4a06-1611495857/ff-5-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/e3598d4a06-1611495857/ff-5-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Then, at the bottom of the new window, you’ll find a checkbox to disable all new requests. Toggle that and you’ll be good to go. This is something you can do in Safari as well btw. You can find the same option under Settings &gt; Websites &gt; Notifications.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/ad7f1b67b6-1611495857/ff-6.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/ad7f1b67b6-1611495857/ff-6-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/ad7f1b67b6-1611495857/ff-6-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/ad7f1b67b6-1611495857/ff-6-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-minimal-browser/ad7f1b67b6-1611495857/ff-6-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>And that’s it. Enjoy your simpler browser. And let me know if you think there’s something else that could be done to improve the browsing experience.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/>
February 28, 2021 | https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/troubleshooting-stuck-process/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/troubleshooting-stuck-process/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was recently troubleshooting an issue where a process seemed to be stuck, not making any progress. Eventually I was able to track down the problem, but along the way I found a few quick ways to start gathering information about a running process.</p>
<p>These tips apply only to Linux systems. I’m sure other operating systems have similar tools, but I am not familiar with them so I won’t mention them here.</p>
<p>I use <code>sleep</code> as an example program to “troubleshoot” throughout this article. You will probably want to replace <code>sleep</code> in my examples below with something more interesting.</p>
<h2>strace</h2>
<p>strace prints out the system calls made by a particular process. One option when using strace is to start the program from within strace:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
$ <span>strace</span> <span>sleep</span> <span>10</span>

execve<span>(</span><span>"/usr/bin/sleep"</span>, <span>[</span><span>"sleep"</span>, <span>"10"</span><span>]</span>, 0x7ffc0b292728 /* <span>54</span> vars */<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>..</span>.
clock_nanosleep<span>(</span>CLOCK_REALTIME, <span>0</span>, <span>{</span>tv_sec<span>=</span><span>10</span>, <span>tv_nsec</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>}</span>, 0x7ffd8fa9ef30<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>..</span>.</code></pre></div>
<p>strace has lots of output so I removed most of it, but watching the output live you can see which system call your process is getting stalled on. In this case it is <code>clock_nanosleep</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you realize you want to see what a process is doing after the process has already started - in that case you can use strace to attach to an existing process by PID:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
$ <span>sleep</span> <span>10</span> <span>&amp;</span>

$ pgrep <span>sleep</span> <span>|</span> <span>xargs</span> -n1 <span>sudo</span> <span>strace</span> -p </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we use <code>pgrep</code> to get the process ID of the <code>sleep</code> process, then use strace to attach to that process. Be aware that <code>pgrep</code> uses a regular expression to match the process name, so you might want to use <code>pgrep ^sleep$</code> or <code>pidof sleep</code> for stricter matching. </p>
<p>The downside to attaching strace to a running application is that if the process has already called into a blocking system call, as is likely the case here with sleep, you won’t see anything with strace until that system call returns and a next system call is invoked.</p>
<h2>procfs kernel stack</h2>
<p>If you use strace to attach to a running process and find it stalled on a blocking syscall (so strace is not providing any output), you can use procfs to determine the currently running syscall, as well as the full kernel stack trace.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
$ <span>sleep</span> <span>10</span> <span>&amp;</span>

$ pgrep <span>sleep</span> <span>|</span> <span>xargs</span> -I % <span>sudo</span> <span>cat</span> /proc/%/stack
<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span><span><span>0</span>&gt;</span><span>]</span> hrtimer_nanosleep+0xca/0x1a0
<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span><span><span>0</span>&gt;</span><span>]</span> common_nsleep+0x40/0x50
<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span><span><span>0</span>&gt;</span><span>]</span> __x64_sys_clock_nanosleep+0xd1/0x140
<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span><span><span>0</span>&gt;</span><span>]</span> do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40
<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span><span><span>0</span>&gt;</span><span>]</span> entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9</code></pre></div>
<p>Here again we can see we are stuck in the <code>clock_nanosleep</code> system call, but this time we are able to figure it out while the process is blocked on the system call, whereas with strace we would have had to start tracing <em>before</em> the process calls the blocking system call.</p>
<h2>userspace trace</h2>
<p>Now you might want to know where in the application code the syscall was called from. Or an alternate case would be that you find the application isn’t stuck in kernel space but rather is stuck executing application code.</p>
<p>You can use <code>gdb</code> to see the current userspace stack trace.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
$ <span>sleep</span> <span>10</span> <span>&amp;</span>

$ pgrep <span>sleep</span> <span>|</span> <span>xargs</span> -n1 <span>sudo</span> gdb --batch -ex <span>"thread apply all bt"</span> -p
0x00007f8b1b29f0da <span>in</span> clock_nanosleep@GLIBC_2.2.5 <span>(</span><span>)</span> from /usr/lib/libc.so.6

Thread <span>1</span> <span>(</span>process <span>132170</span> <span>"sleep"</span><span>)</span>:







<span>[</span>Inferior <span>1</span> <span>(</span>process <span>132170</span><span>)</span> detached<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The usefulness of this information depends on the existence of debug symbols, so you may not get much out of it unless you can re-compile the application with debug symbols included.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ pgrep rust-analyzer <span>|</span> <span>xargs</span> -n1 <span>sudo</span> gdb --batch -ex <span>"thread apply all bt"</span> -p



Thread <span>1</span> <span>(</span>LWP <span>113543</span> <span>"rust-analyzer"</span><span>)</span>:

















</code></pre></div>
<p>This demonstrates what the output might look like for an appication compiled with debug symbols.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These tools probably aren’t enough to immediately root cause an issue, but they are a great way to gather some initial information which can help guide further troubleshooting effort.</p></div></div>]]>

<tt>
<b>DATE:</b> Early February, 1996
<br> 
LOCATION: Cambridge, England, in the conference room of the largest DNA sequencing center in Europe.
<br> 
<b>OCCASION:</b> A high level meeting between the computer scientists of this center and the largest DNA sequencing center in the United States. 
<br>
<b>THE PROBLEM:</b> Although the two centers use almost identical laboratory techniques, almost identical databases, and almost identical data analysis tools, they still can't interchange data or meaningfully compare results.
<br><b>THE SOLUTION:</b> Perl. 
</tt>
<p>
The human genome project was inaugurated at the beginning of the decade as an ambitious international effort to determine the complete DNA sequence of human beings and several experimental animals. The justification for this undertaking is both scientific and medical. By understanding the genetic makeup of an organism in excruciating detail, it is hoped that we will be better able to understand how organisms develop from single eggs into complex multicellular beings, how food is metabolized and transformed into the constituents of the body, how the nervous system assembles itself into a smoothly functioning ensemble. From the medical point of view, the wealth of knowledge that will come from knowing the complete DNA sequence will greatly accelerate the process of finding the causes of (and potential cures for) human diseases.
</p><p> 
Six years after its birth, the genome project is ahead of schedule. Detailed maps of the human and all the experimental animals have been completed (mapping out the DNA using a series of landmarks is an obligatory first step before determining the complete DNA sequence). The sequence of the smallest model organism, yeast, is nearly completed, and the sequence of the next smallest, a tiny soil-dwelling worm, isn't far behind. Large scale sequencing efforts for human DNA started at several centers a number of months ago and will be in full swing within the year.
</p><p> 
The scale of the human DNA sequencing project is enough to send your average UNIX system administrator running for cover. From the information-handling point of view, DNA is a very long string consisting of the four letters G, A, T and C (the letters are abbreviations for the four chemical units that form the "rungs" of the DNA double helix ladder). The goal of the project is to determine the order of letters in the string. The size of the string is impressive but not particularly mind-boggling: 3 x 109 letters long, or some 3 gigabytes of storage space if you use 1 byte to store each letter with no compression techniques.</p><p> 
Three gigabytes is substantial but certainly manageable by today's standards. Unfortunately, this is only what's required to store the finished data. The storage requirements for the experimental data needed to determine this sequence is far more vast. The essential problem is that DNA sequencing technology is currently limited to reading stretches of at most 500 contiguous letters. In order to determine sequences longer than that, the DNA must be sequenced as small overlapping fragments called "reads" and the jigsaw puzzle reassembled by algorithms that look for areas where the sequences match. Because the DNA sequence is nonrandom (similar but not-entirely-identical motifs appear many times throughout the genome), and because DNA sequencing technology is noisy and error-prone, one ends up having to sequence each region of DNA five to ten times in order to reliably assemble the reads into the true sequence. This increases the amount of data to manage by an order of magnitude. On top of this is all the associated information that goes along with laboratory work: who performed the experiment, when it was performed, the section of the genome that was sequenced, the identity and version of the software used to assemble the sequence, any comments someone wants to attach to the experiment, and so forth. In addition, one generally wants to store the raw output from the machine that performs the sequencing. Each 500 letters of sequence generates a data file that's 20-30 kilobytes long!
</p><p> 
That's not the whole of it. It's not enough just to determine the sequence of the DNA. Within the sequence are functional areas scattered among long stretches of nonfunctional areas. There are genes, control regions, structural regions, and even a few viruses that got entangled in human DNA long ago and persist as fossilized remnants. Because the genes and control regions are responsible for health and disease, one wants to identify and mark them as the DNA sequence is assembled. This type of annotation generates yet more data.
</p><p> 
Altogether, people estimate that some one to ten terabytes of information will need to be stored in order to see the human genome project to its conclusion. 
</p><p>
So what's Perl got to do with it? From the beginning, researchers realized that informatics would have to play a large role in the genome project. An informatics core formed an integral part of every genome center that was created. The mission of these cores was two-fold: to provide computer support and databasing services for their affiliated laboratories, and to develop data analysis and management software for use by the genome community as a whole. 
</p><p>
It's fair to say that the initial results of the informatics groups efforts were mixed. Things were slightly better on the laboratory management side of the coin. Some groups attempted to build large monolithic systems on top of complex relational databases; they were thwarted time and again by the highly dynamic nature of biological research. By the time a system that could deal with the ins and outs of a complex laboratory protocol had been designed, implemented and debugged, the protocol had been superseded by new technology and the software engineers had to go back to the drawing board.
</p><p> 
Most groups, however, learned to build modular, loosely-coupled systems whose parts could be swapped in and out without retooling the whole system. In my group, for example, we discovered that many data analysis tasks involve a sequence of semi-independent steps. Consider the steps that one may want to perform on a bit of DNA that has just been sequenced. First there's a basic quality check on the sequence: is it long enough? Are the number of ambiguous letters below the maximum limit? Then there's the "vector check." For technical reasons, the human DNA must be passed through a bacterium before it can be sequenced (this is the process of "cloning"). Not infrequently, the human DNA gets lost somewhere in the process and the sequence that's read consists entirely of the bacterial vector. The vector check ensures that only human DNA gets into the database. Next there's a check for repetitive sequences. Human DNA is full of repetitive elements that make fitting the sequencing jigsaw puzzle together challenging. The repetitive sequence check tries to match the new sequence against a library of known repetitive elements. A penultimate step is to attempt to match the new sequence against other sequences in a large community database of DNA sequences. Often a match at this point will provide a clue to the function of the new DNA sequence. After performing all these checks, the sequence along with the information that's been gathered about it along the way is loaded into the local laboratory database.
</p><p> 
The process of passing a DNA sequence through these independent analytic steps looks kind of like a pipeline, and it didn't take us long to realize that a UNIX pipe could handle the job. We developed a simple Perl-based data exchange format called <i><i>boulderio</i></i> that allowed loosely coupled programs to add information to a pipe-based I/O stream. <i><i>boulderio</i></i> is based on tag/value pairs. A Perl module makes it easy for programs to reach into the input stream, pull out only the tags they're interested in, do something with them, and drop new tags into output the stream. Any tags that the program isn't interested in are just passed through to standard output so that other programs in the pipeline can get to them.
</p><p> 
Using this type of scheme, the process of analyzing a new DNA sequence looks something like this (this is not exactly the set of scripts that we use, but it's close enough):

</p><pre>name_sequence.pl &lt; new.DNA |
quality_check.pl | 
vector_check.pl |
find_repeats.pl |
search_big_database.pl |
load_lab_database.pl
</pre>
<p>
A file containing the new DNA sequence is processed by a Perl script named <tt>name_sequence.pl</tt>, whose only job is to give the sequence a new unique name and to put it into <i><i>boulderio</i></i> format. Its output looks like this:

</p><pre> 
NAME=L26P93.2 
SEQUENCE=GATTTCAGAGTCCCAGATTTCCCCCAGGGGGTTTCCAGAGAGCCC...
</pre>
<p>

The output from name_sequence.pl is next passed to the quality checking program, which looks for the SEQUENCE tag, runs the quality checking algorithm, and writes its conclusion to the data stream. The data stream now looks like this:

 </p><pre>NAME=L26P93.2 
SEQUENCE=GATTTCAGAGTCCCAGATTTCCCCCAGGGGGTTTCCAGAGAGCCC...
QUALITY_CHECK=OK 
</pre>
<p>

Now the data stream enters the vector checker. It pulls the SEQUENCE tag out of the stream and runs the vector checking algorithm. The data stream now looks like this:

</p><pre> 
NAME=L26P93.2 SEQUENCE=GATTTCAGAGTCCCAGATTTCCCCCAGGGGGTTTCCAGAGAGCCC......
QUALITY_CHECK=OK 
VECTOR_CHECK=OK 
VECTOR_START=10 
VECTOR_LENGTH=300 
</pre>
<p>

This continues down the pipeline, until at last the <tt>load_lab_database.pl</tt> script collates all the data, makes some final conclusions about whether the sequence is suitable for further use, and enters all the results into the laboratory database. 
One of the nice features of the <i>boulderio</i> format is that multiple sequence records can be processed sequentially in the same UNIX pipeline. An "=" sign marks the end of one record and the beginning of the next:
	
</p><pre>	 
NAME=L26P93.2 
SEQUENCE=GATTTCAGAGTCCCAGATTTCCCCCAGGGGGTTTCCAGAGAGCCC... 
=
NAME=L26P93.3 
SEQUENCE=CCCCTAGAGAGAGAGAGCCGAGTTCAAAGTCAAAACCCATTCTCTCTC... 
= 
</pre>
<p>

There's also a way to create subrecords …</p></div>

<p>Beer. Everybody likes to drink it. Nobody likes to pay for it. Still, the cost of a beer stings more or less depending on where in the world you’re drinking.</p>
<p>Expensivity wondered just how much the cost of beer differs from country and the effect the price of beer has on national consumption. We researched the price of a beer around the world and used World Health Organization statistics to figure out who’s drinking it all.</p>
<p><em>All prices are in US dollars. All beers are 33cl (330ml) bottles.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<ul><li><strong>Qatar</strong> has the <strong>most expensive beer in the world</strong>, with an average price of <strong>US$11.26</strong> per 33cl (330ml) bottle.</li><li>The <strong>cheapest beer</strong> is in <strong>South Africa</strong>, where the average price is <strong>$1.68</strong> per bottle.</li><li>The <strong>Czech Republic</strong> has the <strong>highest consumption rate</strong>, with <strong>468 beers</strong> per person per year.</li><li><strong>Germans</strong> spend an average <strong>$1,907.78 per year</strong> on beer, the <strong>top figure</strong> in our study.</li></ul>
<h2><strong>Qatar Wins World Cup for Expensive Beer</strong></h2>
<p>A beer in Qatar is expensive. The mostly Muslim country introduced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/middleeast/qatar-tax-alcohol.html">100% tax</a> on alcohol imports ahead of the 2022 World Cup, and visitors need a special permit to drink alcohol. China looks pretty expensive too, but consider that we averaged the price of a hotel beer ($13.61) and a supermarket beer ($1.81). </p>

<p>It’s clear the steep prices are aimed at visitors. Beer is cheapest in South Africa, where a <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-10-26-counting-the-cost-of-cheap-easily-available-alcohol-in-south-africa/">culture of buying in bulk</a> tends to keep prices down.</p>
<h2><strong>The International Beer Index in Full</strong></h2>
<p>Where there is beer, there are beer geeks. Here is Expensivity’s data in full so you can find out exactly what kind of beer culture to expect from country to country. Click the arrows to sort by price, consumption, or total spend.</p>

<p>The ten countries with the highest average annual beer bill each have beer that costs upwards of four bucks. However, second-placed Poland is notable for its 62¢ carry-out beer, suggesting that much of Poland’s $1,738 average beer bill is built up by hotel-faring bachelor parties.</p>
<p>Bosnia is an outlier among the big drinkers: the country is in eighth place for beer consumption by bottle (331/year) but 30<sup>th</sup> for overall spend ($647.21), thanks to an average price that comes in under two bucks.</p>
<h2><strong>Germany Spends the Most On Beer</strong></h2>
<p>Haitians just aren’t that into beer. Spirits account for a whopping<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/973941/alcohol-consumption-latin-america-country-drink-type/"> 97% of booze consumed</a> in Haiti, where people drink fewer than four beers per year on average, with an annual beer bill of $10.02. That’s the lowest beer consumption and spend in our study.</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, Germans spend just shy of $2k/year on beer. We found 15 countries with more expensive beer than Germany, but the nation sinks 411 bottles per person annually, so it pays the most in total. Germany is known for its<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/beer-culture-this-is-how-germany-drinks/a-19201434"> beer culture</a> and a stringent (delicious) beer purity law that has stood for over 500 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Czechia and Spain Lead Drinking Contest</strong></h2>
<p>So, who’s drinking all the beer? The Czech Republic takes the title, with 468 beers per person per year. However, capital Prague is the fourth most-visited city in Europe and infamous for its bachelor parties (<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/prague-different-type-visitor-after-lockdown">for now at least</a>). Like sunny Spain, in second place, Czechia’s beer consumption may be significantly swelled by visiting merry-makers.</p>

<p>Haiti drinks the least beer, counted per bottle or per spend. Most of the countries with a low beer intake can credit their predominantly Muslim populations for the abstinence. Armenia is an exception. The west Asian country drinks just 40 beers per person annually, with locals favoring<a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/armenia/articles/alcoholic-drinks-you-should-try-in-armenia/"> brandy, vodka, and wine</a>.</p>
<p>Armenians might not drink much beer, but the beer they drink is delicious, cheap, and<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/armenia-might-be-one-oldest-and-youngest-beermaking-countries-world-180964860/"> finely crafted</a>. Wherever you’re drinking in the world, be sure to check out the tradition behind your beer, as well as the cost – nothing adds<a href="https://www.expensivity.com/expensivity-by-the-ounce/"> value</a> to your experience like a beer with a story!</p>

<h3><strong>METHODOLOGY &amp; SOURCES</strong></h3>
<p>We collated the prices of a 330ml bottle of beer in supermarkets around the world using online shops, focusing on well-known beer brands such as Corona and Heineken. When we couldn’t find the price via an online shop, we used <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/">numbeo.com</a>.</p>
<p>To gain an average price, we called up hotels to find out the price of a beer from their lobby bar, and when this wasn’t available, we used menus from bars found online. Once all the data was collected, we calculated the average price in US dollars using <a href="http://xe.com/">xe.com</a>.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/alcohol-total-per-capita-(15-)-consumption-(in-litres-of-pure-alcohol)-with-95-ci">World Health</a> <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/alcohol-consumption-of-pure-alcohol-by-type-of-beverage-(-)">Organisation statistics</a>, we found the amount of alcohol consumption per capita and the percentage of annual beer consumption.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I have been working with React for the past couple of years, so naturally, I am not really proud of the code that I wrote when I was just beginning with React, because now I know the mistakes I made which I wasn't aware of back then.</p><p>But fast-forwarding to today, I have learned quite a bit along the way through contributing to open source, watching/reading some interesting blogs and conference talks and viewing how other people write code.</p><p>Here are some Javascript tips that would've helped my past self and maybe you, in writing more efficient and maintainable React code -</p><h2><a id="1-use-conditional-rendering-effectively" href="#1-use-conditional-rendering-effectively"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg> 1. Use conditional rendering effectively</a></h2><p>As a React developer, you must've been in a situation where you only want to display a component when a certain condition from a prop or state is satisfied or render different components depending on the different values of the state.</p><p>For instance, if you have a component where you want to show a loading indicator when the request is being made and render the component with data when the request is successful, this is the way I like to do it -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>SomeComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> isLoading<span>,</span> data <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><p>	<span>if</span><span>(</span>isLoading<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Loader</span></span><span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <span>}</span></p><p>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><br>     <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>DataHandler</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>       .<br>       .<br>     </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>DataHandler</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>But what if you want to render something inside JSX when a particular condition is satisfied in that case you can use the Logical AND operator (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) to render it -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Button</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> showHomeIcon<span>,</span> children<span>,</span> onClick <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>button<span>"</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>    </span><span>{</span>showHomeIcon <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HomeIcon</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><br>    </span><span>{</span>children<span>}</span><span><br>  </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Although a more useful scenario would be doing something like this, where you have an optional prop called icon which is a string and contains the name of the icon that can be used to render the icon component accordingly -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Button</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> icon<span>,</span> children<span>,</span> onClick <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>button<span>"</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>    </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span><br>    </span><span>{</span><span>typeof</span> icon <span>===</span> <span>"string"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Icon</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>icon<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><br>    </span><span>{</span>children<span>}</span><span><br>  </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span></span> <span>icon</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>home<span>"</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>handleClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Home</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Button</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></p><p><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>handleClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>About</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Button</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre><p>So this solves the problem when you only have one component but what about when you have two or more than two components that you want to render based on some prop or state variable?</p><p>For two components ternary operator is my goto method, because of its simiplicity -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>App</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> canViewWelcomeText <span>=</span> <span>isUserAuthenticated</span><span>(</span>props<span>)</span><span>;</span><p>  <span>return</span> canViewWelcomeText <span>?</span> <span>(</span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Hey, there!

Avoid using truthy tests</a></h2><p>If you are familiar with JavaScript then you might be aware of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy">truthy</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy">falsy</a> values. So a truthy test is nothing but using this coercion ability of JavaScript in control flow statements like this</p><pre><code><br><br><span>if</span> <span>(</span>somVar<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>	<span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span> </code></pre><p>This might look good at first if you want to avoid something like <code>null</code> since it is a falsy value so the statement will work as expected. But the catch here is that this is prone to bugs that can be very difficult to track down. This is because the above statement would block the flow for not <code>null</code> but also for all these falsy values of <code>someVar</code> which we might want to avoid -</p><pre><code>someVar <span>=</span> <span>0</span><br>someVar <span>=</span> <span>""</span><br>someVar <span>=</span> <span>false</span><br>someVar <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span></code></pre><p>So what is the correct way for these checks?</p><p>The valid way is being as straightforward as possible for these checks to avoid any bugs from creeping in. For the above case it would be -</p><pre><code><br><span>if</span> <span>(</span>someVar <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>	<span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><blockquote><p>If you're sure that the variable being passed is a boolean then you can use the former approach.</p></blockquote><p>This also applies when doing conditional rendering with the Logical and operator that we saw in the previous tip.</p><p>If the first operator is falsy then JavaScript returns that object. So in case of an expression like <code>0 &amp;&amp; "javascript"</code> will return <code>0</code> and <code>false &amp;&amp; "javascript"</code> will return <code>false</code> . This can bite you if you were doing something like this -</p><pre><code><br><br><span>{</span>cats<span>.</span>length <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>AllCats</span></span> <span>cats</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>cats<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><p><br><br><span>{</span>cats<span>.</span>length <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>AllCats</span></span> <span>cats</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>cats<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><h2><a id="3-use-optional-chaining-and-nullish-coalescing" href="#3-use-optional-chaining-and-nullish-coalescing"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg> 3. Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing</a></h2><p>When dealing with data in our apps we often need to deal with parts of data that call be <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> and provide default values.</p><p>Let's suppose we have an API that returns the details of a Pet in the following format -</p><pre><code><br><span>{</span><br>  id<span>:</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span><br>  name<span>:</span> <span>'Ghost'</span><span>,</span><br>  type<span>:</span> <span>'Mammal'</span><span>,</span><br>  diet<span>:</span> <span>'Carnivore'</span><br>  owner<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    first_name<span>:</span> <span>'Jon'</span><span>,</span><br>    last_name<span>:</span> <span>'Snow'</span><span>,</span><br>    family<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>      name<span>:</span> <span>'Stark'</span><span>,</span><br>      location<span>:</span> <span>'Winterfell'</span><br>    <span>}</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>So you could do something like this if you wanted the first name of the pet owner</p><pre><code><span>const</span> ownerName <span>=</span> pet<span>.</span>owner<span>.</span>first_name<span>;</span></code></pre><p>But like all things in the universe can't be perfect, our API doesn't guarantee that all the details would be available for any given pet and can be <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>In that case, the above line of code can result and the following error "Reference error cannot read property <code>first_name</code> of <code>null</code>" and crash your app if the owner is <code>null</code>.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">optional chaining</a> saves you. The optional chaining operator (<code>?.</code>) allows you to read the property deep in the chain without having to validate whether the chain is valid, and instead of a reference error, it would return the same old <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>So we could easily check for the owner name or even the owner family name without worrying about any errors, like this -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> ownerName <span>=</span> pet<span>?.</span>owner<span>?.</span>first_name<span>;</span><br><span>const</span> ownerFamily <span>=</span> pet<span>?.</span>owner<span>?.</span>family<span>?.</span>name<span>;</span></code></pre><blockquote><p>Optional chaining can also be used with function calls on properties you are not really sure to exist. For instance, you can do this with an array <code>friends?.join(",")</code> , this won't result in an error if friends is anything other than an array, even <code>undefined</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Now, this would avoid errors but you still wouldn't want your users to show <code>undefined</code> in case it is not available. This is where Nullish Coalescing comes in -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> ownerName <span>=</span> pet<span>?.</span>owner<span>?.</span>first_name <span>??</span> <span>'Unknown'</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator">Nullish Coalescing operator</a> (<code>??</code>) returns the right hand side operand when the left hand side is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> and otherwise it returns the left hand side operand.</p><p>You might think here that the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR">Logical Or operator</a> (<code>||</code>) would also have done the same thing. Well in that case I hope you haven't forgotten the truthy and falsy hell of JavaScript that we just covered. Since this operator would return the right hand side operand for all falsy values and can cause hard to debug errors as mentioned in the previous section.</p><blockquote><p>Since these methods were recently released with <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/javascript-whats-new-es2020/">ECMAScript 2020 spec</a> browser compatibility for these methods is still in the preliminary stages and only the modern browsers support it right now.</p><p>But don't worry most setups we use to compile our apps have already got us covered. If you're using TypeScript ≥ 3.7 then <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html">these methods are supported out of the box</a>.</p><p>Else if you're using a typical Webpack + babel setup then you can include the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining"><code>@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining</code></a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator"><code>@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator</code></a> plugins in your babel config to support these methods.</p></blockquote><h2><a id="4-avoid-premature-optimization" href="#4-avoid-premature-optimization"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg> 4. Avoid premature optimization</a></h2><p>Be really careful when you want to memoize something in React, because if not done properly it might lead to even worse performance.</p><p>I have often seen people prematurely optimizing everything they come across without considering the cost it comes with. For instance, using <code>useCallback</code> in situations like this -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>MyForm</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>firstName<span>,</span> setFirstName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>  <span>const</span> <span>handleSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    <br>  <span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p>    <br>  <span>const</span> handleChange <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>setFirstName</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>value<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>onSubmit</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>handleSubmit<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text<span>"</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>firstName<span>"</span></span> <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>handleChange<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span><br>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span><br>    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Now you might've heard that <code>useCallback</code> is known to improve performance by memoizing the function and only updating it when the dependencies change. That is true but you need to understand that <strong>every optimization comes with a cost associated with it</strong>.</p><p>In the above case, you are doing more work by creating a <code>useCallback</code> which in itself is running some logical expression checks, hence you're better off with just defining the inline function directly like this -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>handleChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>setFirstName</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>value<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>The same things apply with <code>React.memo</code>. If you have a component like this that accepts children props, then memoizing the component is basically useless if the children are not memoized -</p><pre><code><span>const</span> UselessMemoizedHeader <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>memo</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> children <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>children<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> <span>SomeComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><br>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>UselessMemoizedHeader</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>        </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Header</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>UselessMemoizedHeader</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>      Count: </span><span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span><br>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>button<span>"</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>currentCount</span> <span>=&gt;</span> currentCount <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>        Increment count<br>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><br>    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>In the above case, the <code>UselessMemoizedHeader</code> component would re-render every time you increment the count even though you might think it is memoized.</p><p>But why? Since memo just does a shallow comparison of the current props and previous props, and because the children prop won't be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness">refrentially equal</a> you end up re-rendering the <code>UselessMemoizedHeader</code> component every time the count changes.</p><p>Your code ends up being even worse off because of that unnecessary children prop comparison on every render.</p><p>So when do you actually need to memoize?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It shouldn’t have to be this way, but the burden of protecting your privacy as you browse the web is your own. I do what I can in my research and consulting to advocate for systemic change in design and policy to reduce the burden on the individual user; but that kind of change is slow to fruit. Meanwhile, there are tools that you, the individual, can use to partially protect yourself against the forces of surveillance capitalism and other institutional privacy threats. I will share five that I use myself.</p><hr><h2 id="i-use-the-dashlane-vpn-to-curtail-web-tracking-and-circumvent-regional-content-filters">I use the Dashlane VPN to curtail web tracking and circumvent regional content filters</h2><p>You probably already know about Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). If you work at a sufficiently large institution, chances are your workplace has one in place to allow you remote access to the institution’s intranet. VPNs do more than helping employers facilitate secure intranet access, however. VPNs help obfuscate your web traffic — both from the websites you visit, and from your Internet Service Provider (e.g., Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T).</p><p>Eliding key technical details, you can think of a VPN as a middleman / intermediary between you and the Internet-at-large. While this slows down your connection slightly, the benefit is that the rest of your web traffic is encrypted and routed through this middleman. This provides privacy benefits because, without the use of something like a VPN, ISPs can track every website you visit online. If you visit websites over plain HTTP (instead of HTTPS), they can only track what you do on those websites. And any personal data that your ISP keeps on you can be subpoena’d by, e.g., law enforcement. Moreover, ISPs can sell this information freely — e.g., to advertising brokers, who may want to sell you targeted ads based on the websites you have frequented. You consented to this when you agreed to their terms of service.</p><p>Does that sound a little shady? It is! There are only a handful of ISPs in the country; in specific regions, there may be only one. And they work tirelessly to make sure that competitors cannot make headway. So most people do not have a real choice when it comes to their ISP. They agree to the terms because what else can they do if they want Internet?</p><p>Using a VPN service, the ISP will no longer be able to see what you download and what websites you visit. They <em>will</em> be able to see some meta-data, however — e.g., that you are using a VPN, the encrypted data you are receiving and when you are connecting.</p><p>VPNs also allow you to hide or disguise yourself from the websites you visit. Indeed, many VPNs have servers all over the world. So, if there is content that is being blocked in the U.S. but not in Germany, you can use a VPN to make it seem like you are connecting from Germany.</p><p>The downside? Middlemen are usually inefficient — and indeed, using a VPN will make your connection a little slower than if you were to not use it. Also, private VPN services cost money —&nbsp;usually between $5 and $15 / month. Moreover, you are simply displacing trust from the ISP to the VPN service. While your ISP will not be able to see the websites you visit, the VPN service will be able to. Because of this, as a part of their terms of service, good private VPN services should be stateless — they should not keep any record of the websites you visit through the VPN. This is also why you probably do <em>not</em> want to use your corporate VPN for surfing the web privately —&nbsp;your employer will be able to see your web traffic if you do so.</p><p>Private VPN services are now common — some popular private VPN services include Express VPN and Nord VPN. I have not used either, so I will not comment on them. But I know many people who use those services and have not heard any direct complaints.</p><p>I use the Dashlane VPN, and it works great. I use the Dashlane VPN because I use the Dashlane premium password manager, and the VPN service is included in the fee I pay for Dashlane premium. If you would like to try Dashlane premium for free for six months, you may use <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/cs/s23HfOIFsAxE">this referral link</a>.</p><h2 id="i-use-firefox-with-ublock-origin--decentraleyes-for-curtailing-web-trackers-while-browsing">I use Firefox with uBlock Origin + Decentraleyes for curtailing web trackers while browsing</h2><p>ISPs are just one threat to your privacy; many of the websites you visit also track and store as much information about you as they can — the websites you visit, what you do on them, at what time of day, etc. Why? Because the prevailing business model of the web is surveillance capitalism — keeping track of your personal data allows advertisers to develop rich profiles of what you like and what they would like you to like. These data, in turn, can be used to serve you with personalized advertisements —&nbsp;and it’s important to note that these advertisements are not just obvious ones like Nike shoes you might like, but also things like article recommendations from political campaigns.</p><p>Stopping this tracking and nudging is not easy, but it starts with your choice of web browser. If you care about privacy, do not use web browsers released by institutions that have little vested interest in protecting your personal data.</p><p>I use Firefox. Firefox has some nice in-built or officially supported privacy-preserving features — e.g., automated tracking prevention and containers. Containers help you isolate cookies to prevent third-party tracking. For example, with the Facebook container add-on on Firefox, you can be assured that Facebook cookies will not be</p><p>In addition to these in-built features, I also use a few extensions to further subvert tracking efforts. The most important is <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>, an extension that automatically blocks thousands of known tracking scripts and advertisements. The second is <a href="https://decentraleyes.org/">Decentraleyes</a>, which blocks requests for common scripts distributed through centralized CDNs and provides local versions of those scripts instead — e.g., for Google fonts. This prevents the hosts of those CDNs (often large companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook) from tracking which websites you visit when those websites request content from those CDNs. Both of these extensions are open source; so I trust them more than I do less transparent alternatives like Ghostery.</p><p>Other privacy enthusiasts use Brave instead of Firefox. Brave is a relatively new web browser that has in-built tracker protection. It is also piloting an interesting new business model for <a href="https://brave.com/intro-to-brave-ads/">privacy-preserving targeted ads</a> —&nbsp;the goal is to match a local “interests” profile that never leaves your computer with a set of candidate advertisements; this way, you get targeted advertisements without being tracked by a remote entity.</p><p>So why do I use Firefox and not Brave? I used to use Brave; I like Brave. But it started getting very slow for collaborative text editing on Overleaf on my machine. So, I switched to Firefox as my primary browser because I spend a lot of time writing papers on overleaf. There is also <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/brave-browsers-affiliate-link-controversy-explained">refer gate</a> — i.e., Brave’s autocompleting of urls to cryptocurrency webpages to append their own affiliate codes. This has since been fixed, but it did build some enmity with the community.</p><p>My main qualm with Firefox is that while Mozilla is doubling down on its identity as a consumer privacy company, <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2020/12/10/mozillas-revenue-jumped-to-828-million-u-s-dollar-in-2019/">the majority of its revenues do still come from Google ads</a> — when you search for something through the Mozilla browser and you click on an ad on Google, Mozilla gets a royalty. While this is not a direct conflict of interest, it does mean that Mozilla profits from surveillance capitalism, too.</p><h2 id="i-use-protonmail-for-secure-encrypted-email-that-is-not-tracked-or-analyzed">I use ProtonMail for secure, encrypted email that is not tracked or analyzed</h2><p>Would it surprise you to learn that many free email services analyze your email? It shouldn’t; it’s how spam detection works, for example. But services like Gmail analyze your email for a lot more than spam detection. As with most other Google services, Gmail is beautiful, fast, usable and free. But in using it, you consent to Google being able to track what you say, what people are saying to you, and who you know. That information can be used by Google to learn more about you and your interests to serve you personalized ads; it can also be subpoena’d by the government.</p><p>I won’t dwell on this point for long, because most people understand email privacy without me needing to delve into the technical details. There are many secure email alternatives to Gmail now; what you are looking for, again, is service provided by a company that does not make its money from collecting personal data. Ideally, you will also want to find a company with servers hosted in a country with stronger consumer privacy protections —&nbsp;e.g., Switzerland or Estonia.</p><p>I use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>. It has a clean interface, and provides a host of nice security features (included end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages).</p><h2 id="i-use-signal-for-end-to-end-encrypted-messaging">I use Signal for end-to-end encrypted messaging</h2><p>For all the same reasons that you might want privacy-preserving email, you want privacy-preserving messaging as well and this means a messaging service that utilizes end-to-end encryption (E2EE). E2EE means that only the sender and intended receivers will be able to read the messages. Nobody else — not even the service it self — will be able to read the messages.</p><p>While there are a number of E2EE messaging applications on the marketplace, I use and recommend Signal for two reasons. First, security in theory is different than security in practice. The Signal protocol is open-source and has been vetted by many in the security community, and so it easier to trust its security “in practice”. Second, at least partially owing to WhatsApp’s recent announcement that it will share data with Facebook, a lot of people now use Signal — and that’s important because a messenger is only useful if the person you want to message uses it! In fact, some research I did back in 2016 found that the key driver of secure messaging use was not promises of security, but simply the presence of one’s friends on the platform <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="i-use-duckduckgo-for-tracking-free-search">I use DuckDuckGo for tracking-free search</h2><p>If you are reading this blog post, I do not think I have to convince you that search engines like Google track …</p></div></div>

<p>This article contains a brief overview and a background of the&nbsp;<em>A-Z80</em> CPU created for FPGA boards and a <em>ZX Spectrum</em> implementation tied to it.</p>

<p>Every so often I let go of all that's on my mind and simply brainstorm and play with new ideas and their combinations (mostly based on the retro stuff). Then I pick what seems to excite me the most and deep dive into it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1156"><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas-512x341.jpg" alt="(partial) list of brainstorming ideas (2014)" width="512" height="341" srcset="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas-512x341.jpg 512w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas-150x100.jpg 150w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas-960x640.jpg 960w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ideas.jpg 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1156">(partial) list of brainstorming ideas (2014)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This time (early 2014), I wanted to re-make a <em>Sinclair ZX Spectrum</em> on an <strong>FPGA</strong>. There were already several implementations available and most of them used "off the shelf" components. One could simply pluck components written in Verilog (CPU, ULA) and with some glue logic quickly build a retro FPGA solution. There is no fun in doing that - or at least nothing much to learn about each component as one could learn by creating them from scratch.</p>
<p>I wanted to start with the Zilog Z80 CPU. Since the real people design their own CPUs (right?!), I decided I would make my own version of it. 🙂</p>
<p>Both parts of this project (the&nbsp;<a title="A Z80 From the Ground Up" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/z80-ground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A-Z80 CPU</a> and a <a title="Sinclair ZX Spectrum on the A-Z80" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/sinclair-zx-spectrum-z80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZX Spectrum</a> code that uses it) are fully described in separate blogs, and here I will try to tie them together using a somewhat less technical narrative.</p>
<p>I started reverse-engineering Zilog Z80 CPU about a year ago by running a working chip on a&nbsp;custom Arduino dongle board. I described it <a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/arduino-zilog-z80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. It was interesting to see how the pins responded to various scenarios. I was mostly interested in <a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/zilog-z80-undocumented-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undocumented behaviour</a>&nbsp;hoping it will give me some hints on the CPU's internal architecture.</p>
<p>Then, I've found a set of articles by Ken Shirriff who actually reverse-engineered large portions of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Z80 from an image of a die. I've found the knowledge of "reading a die image" very exciting and the skill (in a weird way) very useful, so painstakingly I've learned to do the same. I reverse engineered a few other pieces of that silicon, like the <a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/z80-instruction-register-deciphered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IR</a> register and a <a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/anatomy-z80-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data pin</a>. Soon I got a hang of it&nbsp;and started "reading" other parts, as needed. It felt like a whole new world opened right in front of my eyes! Not much unlike stereogram images: as you look at it long enough, gates suddenly pop up in your mind and you start seeing transistors, pull-ups and latches out of a tangled mesh of colorful flat traces.</p>
<p>I had purchased an Altera FPGA board with a desire to learn that technology after working on a project at my work which was using one, quite beefy, Altera chip. Designing a circuitry on my own, I felt, was an exciting challenge and a great learning opportunity. Soon, I figured out how Verilog/SystemVerilog "works"; a language not too difficult to learn for any software person. I also brushed up on a logic design (I had one lousy taught EE class some 20 years ago).</p>
<p>Long story short, I started implementing selected parts of Z80 in the <em>Quartus</em> schematic editor and wrote related&nbsp;<em>ModelSim</em> tests one by one: first came the ALU (since it's design was well described by Ken), then the register file, sequencer, etc. Frankly, I did not know how would all of that fit or work <em>together</em>; I was simply enjoying the process, one block at a time. I just <em>loved</em> seeing wires toggling and gates doing their thing in a&nbsp;ModelSim simulation: a certain deep understanding of a digital design sank in while playing with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run-512x307.png" alt="modelsim_run" width="512" height="307" srcset="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run-512x307.png 512w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run-150x90.png 150w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run-1024x615.png 1024w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run-960x577.png 960w, https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/modelsim_run.png 1680w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>I also read all I could get my hands on: patents on Z80 (and other CPUs) which provided valuable insights; talks, lectures and over time I got a pretty good ideas on how it all&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The most complicated task was to create the instruction timing matrix. Using all the information gathered in the process, I created an Excel spreadsheet with the exact timing of required micro-operations for each M (machine) and T (clock) stated of each opcode class.</p>
<p>This matrix defines the CPU and ensures it is fully Z80-compatible. In fact, if you modify it, you could create new instructions, enhance the CPU or even create a completely different one and the design would still just work!</p>

<p>Each column, <strong>B</strong> through <strong>AH</strong>, contains zero or more micro-operations on specific internal design blocks (<a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/webshare/timing_macros.i.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this file</a> deciphers the tokens used). Groups of instructions are listed in a row as statically decoded by the PLA table, each line corresponding to specific M and T cycle.</p>
<p>Rather early in the process, I devised several tests, including a&nbsp;full <em>Fuse</em>-based test suite which could run every instruction against a set of known results. That test proved the most valuable: it enabled to flag regressions as well as to check that the instructions were implemented correctly.</p>
<p>After some time, I was able to combine several Z80 instructions and run them in sequence. Enjoying many exciting milestone moments along the way, the one that stuck was when the PC register correctly incremented and was fetching successive instructions. They were also correctly executed since each one was tested separately: it all just worked!</p>
<p>After adding a virtual UART module in Verilog, I was able to get simple "Hello, world" programs sending the text out to a terminal! The same output would be captured by&nbsp;ModelSim simulating that code. It proved very helpful having several different ways to test and correlate the results.</p>
<p>The most difficult part was getting the interrupt handling done just right. Z80 has 3 interrupt modes (im0, im1, im2), maskable INT with two flags (the enable bit and its shadow) and non-maskable NMI. INT is level-triggered while the NMI is latched, edge-triggered and has precedence over INT. The pins should be checked at known times and be inhibited in certain situations, including during the execution of some instructions. It all needed to be working perfectly at known clock boundaries.</p>
<p>The solution ended up very elegant and used minimum number of extra gates: besides necessary state flags and priority logic, it used a couple of control signals wired just right: see the timings page 7, lines 1028-1060, entry "rst p" and how the instruction RST38 is being used to handle both NMI and INT (im2) at the same time. You start seeing a beauty of the original Mr. Faggin's design when you realize the coherence of the known behavior and the most optimal implementation. The simplicity of it became the proof of the implementation.</p>
<p>Once the CPU was wrapped up, it could run any code sequence using any instruction assembled and pushed onto a simple "board" model. That included some devilish and mean-designed interrupt-bombardment tests. It also run well known ZEXDOC and ZEXALL programs. They all passed except several XF/YF (undocumented flags) behavioral tests for 2 sets of instructions. Those are <em>really</em> weird and if you have ever played with Z80 emulators you would know what I mean. This particular Z80 behavior is likely a side-effect of internal bus charge/discharge cycles and some spurious control signals; various second-sourced and cloned Z80 chips also behave differently in these scenarios. I decided not to sweat over it as it had no practical impact.</p>
<p>Frankly, at this stage, I was already satisfied with the results since my original goal was to understand and replicate the internal architecture of the Z80, and I have achieved it.</p>
<p>Compare the following image - a conceptual block diagram of the A-Z80 CPU - with the annotated image of a Z80 die from the top&nbsp;of this article to see the similarity in the layout. I have placed schematic modules at the locations roughly corresponding to their positions on the Z80 die. Not to scale. You should be able to trace major buses (data bus in green and address bus in red) and zoom into detailed diagrams to see gate level implementations of the blocks. A few System Verilog sources appear just symbolically; naturally, the complete code would not fit on a printed page. Open it up in an image viewer that can zoom and pan.</p>

<p>By that time, I was already fairly fluent in Verilog so the coding of a <em>ZX Spectrum</em> model was not a problem. First, I added a video unit by picking one (most suitable) VGA timing standard and was able to display static screens from various games. Then came the correct character blink and border behavior. After that: keyboard interface, speaker, mic - all fairly simple modules. Once I got all internal mappings correctly set up, I powered it up, flashed it with the newest FPGA file and, to my huge excitement, saw a black screen clearing up and the magic "<strong>(C) 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd</strong>" prompt on the screen! I can't tell you just how exciting that moment was; I kept resetting it over and over just to see it appearing again!</p>
<p>Soon I was able to load and play games!</p>

<p>But, there was one problem: the design would randomly reboot or lock up. I spent a long time debugging it but a chance conversation with Ed (a co-worker of mine, Ed is a world-class chip designer who <em>really</em> knows this stuff) would reveal a possible problem: trying to follow the exact Z80 architecture, I have used transparent latches in my FPGA design throughout. Well, no FPGA designs use latches these days. Ed told me a latch design would have never worked [reliably]. Well, I <em>did</em> make it work, somehow. Kind of.</p>
<p>Back to the drawing board and one month later, I have re-implemented the whole design to use flip-flops. Accordingly, I also had to modify a few timings here and there. The new design is fully synchronous and meets all&nbsp;timings; it is being checked using the&nbsp;<em>TimeQuest</em> static timing analyzer tool and have fully constrained timings (using SDC files). In the meantime, I've also found and fixed several issues including one important bug fix in the …</p></div></div>

<h4 id="preword">Preword</h4>

<p>This post contains my own opinions, not the opinions of my employer or any open source groups I
belong or contribute to.</p>

<p>It’s also been rewritten 2½ times, and (I think) reads confusingly in places. But I promised
myself that I’d get it out of the door instead of continuing to sit on it, so here we go.</p>

<hr>

<p>There’s been a decent amount of <del>drama</del> debate in the open source community about <em>support</em>
recently, originating primarily from
<a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">pyca/cryptography’s decision to use Rust for some ASN.1 parsing routines</a><sup id="fnref:asn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:asn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To summarize the situation: building the latest <code>pyca/cryptography</code> release from scratch now requires
a Rust toolchain. The only currently<sup id="fnref:gccrust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gccrust">2</a></sup> Rust toolchain is built on <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>, which
supports a (relatively) limited
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CompilerWriterInfo.html">set of architectures</a>. Rust further whittles this
set down into <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">support tiers</a>, with
some targets not receiving automated testing (tier 2) or official builds (tier 3).</p>

<p>By contrast, upstream<sup id="fnref:gcchell" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gcchell">3</a></sup> GCC supports a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/backends.html">somewhat larger</a>
set of architectures. But C<sup id="fnref:c" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:c">4</a></sup>, cancer that it is, finds its way onto every architecture with or
without GCC (or LLVM’s) help, and thereby bootstraps <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">everything</a>
<a href="https://www.gnome.org/">else</a>.</p>

<p>Program packagers and distributors (frequently separate from project maintainers themselves)
are very used to C’s universal presence. They’re so used to it that they’ve built generic
mechanisms for putting entire distributions onto new architectures with
only a single assumption: the presence of a serviceable C compiler.</p>

<p>This is the heart of the conflict: Rust (and many other modern, safe languages) use LLVM for its
relative simplicity<sup id="fnref:simple" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:simple">5</a></sup>, but LLVM does not support either native or cross-compilation to many
less popular (read: niche) architectures. Package managers are increasingly finding that one of
their oldest assumptions can be easily violated, and they’re not happy about that.</p>

<p>But here’s the problem: <em>it’s a bad assumption</em>. The fact that it’s the default
represents an <strong>unmitigated</strong> security, reliability, and reproducibility <em>disaster</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-thought-problem">A little thought problem</h2>

<p>Imagine, for a moment, that you’re a maintainer of a popular project.</p>

<p>Everything has gone right for you: you have happy users, an active development base, and maybe even
corporate sponsors. You’ve also got a CI/CD pipeline that produces canonical releases of your
project on tested architectures; you treat any issues with uses of those releases as a bug in the
project itself, since you’ve taken responsibility for packaging it.</p>

<p>Because your project is popular, <strong>others</strong> also distribute it: Linux distributions, third-party
package managers, and corporations seeking to deploy their own controlled builds. These others have
slightly different needs and setups and, to varying degrees, will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build your project with slightly (or completely) different versions of dependencies</li>
  <li>Build your project with slightly (or completely) different optimization flags and other potentially
ABI-breaking options</li>
  <li>Distribute your project with insecure or outright broken defaults</li>
  <li>Disable important security features because other parts of their ecosystem haven’t caught up</li>
  <li>Patch your project or its build to make it “work” (read: compile and not crash immediately) with
completely new dependencies, compilers, toolchains, architectures, and environmental constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t know about <em>any</em> of the above until the bug reports start rolling in: users will report
bugs that have already been fixed, bugs that you explicitly document as caused by unsupported
configurations, bugs that <em>don’t make any sense whatsoever</em>.</p>

<p>You struggle to debug your users’ reports, since you don’t have access to the niche
hardware, environments, or corporate systems that they’re running on. You slowly burn out
as an unending torrent of already fixed bugs that never seem to make it to your users. Your
user base is unhappy, and you start to wonder why you’re putting all this effort into
project maintenance in the first place. Open source was supposed to be fun!</p>

<p>What’s the point of this spiel? It’s <em>precisely</em> what happened to <code>pyca/cryptography</code>:
nobody asked them whether it was a good idea to try to run their code on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-RISC">HPPA</a>, much less
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390">System/390</a><sup id="fnref:s390" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:s390">6</a></sup>; some packagers just went ahead
and did it, and are frustrated that it no longer works. People just <em>assumed</em> that it
would, because there is <em>still</em> a norm that everything flows from C, and that any
host with a halfway-functional C compiler should have the entire open source ecosystem
at its disposal.</p>

<h3 id="reflections-on-trusting-random-platforms">Reflections on trusting random platforms<sup id="fnref:rott" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rott">7</a></sup></h3>

<p>Security-sensitive software<sup id="fnref:security" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:security">8</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:reliability" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reliability">9</a></sup>, <em>particularly</em> software written
in unsafe languages, is <strong>never</strong> secure in its own right.</p>

<p>The security of a program is a function of its own design and testing,
<em>as well as</em> the design, testing, and basic correctness of its underlying platform: everything from
the userspace, to the kernel, to the compilers themselves. The latter
is an <strong>unsolved problem</strong> in the <em>very best of cases</em>: bugs are <em>regularly</em>
found in even the most mature compilers (Clang, GCC) and their most mature backends (x86, ARM). Tiny
changes to or differences in build systems can have profound effects at the binary level, like
<a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2018/08/when-aslr-is-not-really-aslr---the-case-of-incorrect-assumptions-and-bad-defaults.html">accidentally removing security mitigations</a>.
Seemingly innocuous patches can make otherwise safe code
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/GNU_stack_quickstart">exploitable</a> in the context of
other vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The problem gets worse as we move towards niche architectures and targets that are used
primarily by small hobbyist communities.
Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series">m68k</a>
(one of the other architectures affected by <code>pyca/cryptography</code>’s move to Rust): even
GCC <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2019-10/msg02044.html">was considering</a> removing
support due to lack of maintenance, until hobbyists stepped in. That isn’t to say that any
<em>particular</em> niche target is full of bugs<sup id="fnref:although" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:although">10</a></sup>; only to say that it’s a greater likelihood
for niche targets <em>in general</em>. <strong>Nobody</strong> is regularly testing the mountain of userspace
code that implicitly forms an operating contract with arbitrary programs on these platforms.</p>

<p>Project maintainers don’t want to chase down compiler bugs on ISAs or systems that they never
intended to support in the first place, and aren’t receiving any active support feedback about.
They <em>especially</em> don’t want to have vulnerabilities associated
with their projects because of buggy toolchains <em>or</em> tooling inertia when working on security
improvements.</p>

<h3 id="some-more-finger-pointing">Some more finger-pointing</h3>

<p>As someone who <em>likes</em> C: this is all C’s fault. Really.</p>

<p>Beyond language-level unsafety (plenty of people have
<a href="https://fishinabarrel.github.io/">covered that already</a>), C is <em>organizationally</em> unsafe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no standard way to write tests for C.</p>

    <p>Functional and/or unit tests <em>alone</em> would go a long
way in assuring baseline correctness on weird architectures or platforms, but the cognitive
overhead of testing C <em>and</em> getting those tests running ensures that well-tested builds of C
programs will continue to be the exception, rather than the rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no standard way to build C programs.</p>

    <p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2019/04/23/Make-is-probably-fine">Make is fine</a>, but it’s not standard.
Disturbingly large swathes of critical open source infrastructure are compiled using a hodgepodge
of Make, autogenerated rules from autotools, and the maintainer’s boutique shell scripts. One
consequence of this is that C builds tend to be flexible <em>to a fault</em>: prospective packagers
can inject all sorts of behavior-modifying flags that may not be attested directly
in the compiled binary or other build products. The result: it’s almost impossible to prove that
two separate builds on different machines are the same, which means more maintainer pain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no standard way to distribute C programs.</p>

    <p>Yes, I know that package managers exist. Yes, I know how to statically link. Yes, I know how to
vendor libraries and distribute self-contained program “bundles”. None of these are or amount to
a <em>complete</em> standard, and each introduces additional logistical or security problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no such thing as truly cross-platform C.</p>

    <p>The C abstract machine, despite looking a lot like a PDP-11, leaks the underlying memory
and ordering semantics of the architecture being targeted. The result is that even seasoned
C programmers regularly rely on architecture-specific assumptions when writing ostensibly
cross-platform code: assumptions about the atomicity of reads and writes, operation ordering,
coherence and visibility in self-modifying code, the safety and performance of unaligned accesses,
and so forth. Each of these, apart from being a potential source of unsafety, are <strong>impossible
to detect</strong> statically in the general case: they are, after all, perfectly correct
(and frequently intended!) on the programmer’s host architecture.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By contemporary programming language standards, these are conspicuous gaps in functionality:
we’ve long since learned to bake testing, building, distribution, and sound abstract machine
semantics into the standard tooling for languages (and language design itself). But their absence
is <strong>doubly pernicious</strong>: they ensure that C remains a perpetually
unsafe development ecosystem, <em>and</em> an appealing target when bootstrapping a new platform.</p>

<h2 id="the-life-of-a-package-maintainer-is-hard">The life of a package maintainer is hard</h2>

<p>The project maintainer isn’t the only person hurting in the status quo.</p>

<p>Everything stated above <em>also</em> leads to a bum job for the lowly package maintainer<sup id="fnref:yt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yt">11</a></sup>. They’re
(probably) also an unpaid open source hobbyist, and they’re operating with constraints that
the upstream isn’t likely to immediately understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The need to link against versions of dependencies that have already been packaged (and perhaps patched)</li>
  <li>ABI and ISA subset constraints, stemming from a need to distribute binaries that function with
relatively old versions of <code>glibc</code> or x86-64 CPUs without modern extensions</li>
  <li>Limited visibility into each project’s test suite and how to run it, much less what to do when
it fails</li>
</ul>

<p>They <em>also</em> have to deal with users who are unsympathetic to those reports, and who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rarely submit reports to the packager (they bug the project directly instead!), or …</li></ul></div>

This blog post explains three different scenarios+tools for you.</p><blockquote><p>Please ping me if there is something wrong. <a href="https://twitter.com/erkan_erol_">https://twitter.com/erkan_erol_</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="setup">Setup</h2><p>Here is our basic setup to explain the scenarios.</p><p><img src="https://erkanerol.github.io/img/k8s-services/Setup.png" title="Setup"></p><p>We have 3 services. <code>service-front</code> is exposed to the public via an ingress. <code>service-front</code> depends on <code>service-middle</code> and <code>service-middle</code> depends on <code>service-back</code>. The communications are done through k8s services.</p><p>To install this setup, here are the necessary commands:</p><pre><code>kubectl create ns service-debug
kubectl -n service-debug run service-back --image=erkanerol/service-back:v1 --port=8080 --expose=true --labels="app=back"
kubectl -n service-debug run service-middle --image=erkanerol/service-middle:v1 --port=8081 --expose=true --labels="app=middle"
kubectl -n service-debug run service-front --image=erkanerol/service-front:v1 --port=8082 --expose=true --labels="app=front"
</code></pre><p>Here is the source code of these services: <a href="https://github.com/erkanerol/service-examples-for-blog">https://github.com/erkanerol/service-examples-for-blog</a></p><h4 id="scenario">Scenario:</h4><p>As a developer, I want to send some requests to <code>service-back</code> directly and see the result without touching the other services.</p><h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4><p><code>service-back</code> is not exposed to the public and you cannot send requests to it directly.</p><h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4><p>With <code>kubectl port-forward</code>, it is possible to open a tunnel from your local machine to the <code>service-back</code> in the cluster. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward">https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward</a></p><h4 id="steps">Steps:</h4><p>Run the command below in a terminal.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl -n service-debug port-forward service/service-back 8080:8080
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -&gt; 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -&gt; 8080
</code></pre><p><br>Then run the curl command below in another terminal to see that you are able to access <code>service-back</code></p><pre><code>$ curl localhost:8080
Timestamp from back:1614508193
</code></pre><h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4><p><img src="https://erkanerol.github.io/img/k8s-services/Level1.png" title="Level1"></p><p><code>kubectl</code> starts a process which binds <code>localhost:8080</code>. It listens that port and establishes a connection to api-server, which forwards the requests to <code>service-back</code>.</p><h4 id="scenario-1">Scenario:</h4><p>As a developer, I want to run <code>service-front</code> in my local machine so that I can put breakpoints in my IDE to debug my application.</p><h4 id="problem-1">Problem:</h4><p><code>service-front</code> is designed to run in Kubernetes and it accesses <code>service-middle</code> via the k8s service. The service name is hardcoded or hard to be configurable or you are too lazy to mock the dependencies in your local machine.</p><h4 id="solution-1">Solution:</h4><p><code>kubefwd</code> is a useful tool for this problem. It does bulk port-forwarding and manages dns entries in your local machine. See <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd</a></p><h4 id="steps-1">Steps:</h4><p>Run the command below in a terminal</p><pre><code>$ sudo KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG kubefwd svc -n service-debug -l app=middle
</code></pre><blockquote><p>Note that <code>kubefwd</code> requires root privileges and it has to be run with <code>sudo</code>. Set <code>KUBECONFIG</code> variable without any home folder reference beforehand.</p></blockquote><p>In another terminal, run <code>front</code> application in your local machine. Note that you can run it in debug mode as well and put breakpoints.</p><pre><code>$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/erkanerol/service-examples-for-blog.git
$ cd service-examples-for-blog/front
$ go run main.go
</code></pre><p>In another terminal, Send a request to <code>front</code> app to see that your front app serves locally and it accesses <code>service-middle</code> in the cluster.</p><pre><code>$ curl localhost:8082
Response from service middle:'Response from service back:'Timestamp from back:1614513901''
</code></pre><h4 id="how-does-it-work-1">How does it work?</h4><p><img src="https://erkanerol.github.io/img/k8s-services/Level2.png" title="Level2"></p><p>As you can see from the logs of <code>kubefwd</code></p><pre><code>...
INFO[14:07:38] 'cat /etc/hosts' to see all host entries.    
INFO[14:07:38] Loaded hosts file /etc/hosts                 
INFO[14:07:38] HostFile management: Original hosts backup already exists at /root/hosts.original 
...
INFO[14:07:38] Port-Forward: 127.1.27.1 service-middle:8081 to pod service-middle:8081 
...
</code></pre><p>It starts a process that binds <code>127.1.27.1:8081</code> and manipulates the <code>/etc/hosts</code> for <code>service-middle</code></p><pre><code>$ cat /etc/hosts |grep service-middle
127.1.27.1       service-middle.default service-middle.default.svc service-middle.default.svc.cluster.local service-middle.default.minikube service-middle.default.svc.minikube service-middle.default.svc.cluster.minikube service-middle service-middle.service-debug service-middle.service-debug.svc service-middle.service-debug.svc.cluster.local service-middle.service-debug.minikube service-middle.service-debug.svc.minikube service-middle.service-debug.svc.cluster.minikube
</code></pre><div><p>Then your local <code>front</code> app can access the <code>service-middle</code> like in k8s cluster without any extra effort.</p></div><h4 id="scenario-2">Scenario:</h4><p>As a developer, I want to run <code>service-middle</code> in my local machine so that I can put breakpoints in my IDE to debug my application.</p><h4 id="problem-2">Problem:</h4><p><code>service-middle</code> is designed to run in Kubernetes. It accesses <code>service-back</code> via k8s services. Also, its consumer <code>service-front</code> is running on k8s. The services are not available in your local machine and it is hard to mock all these environments in your local machine.</p><h4 id="solution-2">Solution:</h4><p><code>telepresence</code> is a useful tool for this problem. See <a href="https://www.telepresence.io/">https://www.telepresence.io/</a></p><h4 id="steps-2">Steps:</h4><p>Delete <code>service-middle</code> from your k8s cluster at first. We will run it locally.</p><pre><code>kubectl -n service-debug delete service service-middle --ignore-not-found=true
kubectl -n service-debug delete pod service-middle --ignore-not-found=true
</code></pre><p><br>Run telepresence for <code>service-middle</code></p><pre><code>telepresence --namespace service-debug --new-deployment service-middle --expose 8081
</code></pre><p><br>In another terminal, run <code>middle</code> application in your local machine. Note that you can run it in debug mode as well and put breakpoints.</p><pre><code>$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/erkanerol/service-examples-for-blog.git
$ cd service-examples-for-blog/middle
$ go run main.go
</code></pre><p><br>In another terminal, run the command below to send a request to <code>service-front</code> via a temporary pod in the cluster.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl -n service-debug run curl -it  --rm=true --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- http://service-front:8082 
Response from service middle:'Response from service back:'Timestamp from back:1614517363''pod "curl" deleted
</code></pre><p>Note that your request goes to <code>service-front</code> in k8s, which sends a request to <code>service-middle</code> in your local machine, which sends a request to <code>service-back</code> in the cluster.</p><h4 id="how-does-it-work-2">How does it work?</h4><p><img src="https://erkanerol.github.io/img/k8s-services/Level3.png" title="Level3"></p><p>Basically, <code>telepresence</code> deploys a proxy/fake agent into cluster and opens a two-way tunnel between your local environment and the cluster via that agent. Then you are able to run the <code>middle</code> service in your local machine without adapting the consumers/dependent services.</p><p>A detailed explanation about how telepresence works is available here: <a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/how-it-works">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/how-it-works</a></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><ul><li>If you need to access a service without exposing it to public, <code>kubectl port-forward</code> is enough.</li><li>If you need to run a service locally for debugging and your service needs to access other services on k8s, <code>kubefwd</code> is enough. It manages DNS entries in your local machine and opens a one-way tunnel from your machine to cluster for the dependencies of your service.</li><li>If you need to run a service locally for debugging and your application has some consumers in the cluster, <code>telepresence</code> is your tool. It opens two-way network channel and it forwards requests from cluster to your local instance as well.</li></ul><p>p.s. Admission webhooks in Kubernetes are similar to <code>service-middle</code>. They receive some requests from api-server and they may send some requests to other services in the cluster. Therefore, <code>telepresence</code> is a useful tool for debugging admission webhooks. In the next blog post, I am going to explain how to debug validating webhooks.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>When you need to scale an application with a lot of data, how do you decide on a storage solution? How can you both safely store and efficiently interact with large data sets? This often turns into a debate about whether to use SQL or NoSQL. Each comes with strengths and drawbacks.</p>
<p>But what if there was a third option that sidestepped database concerns altogether?</p>
<p>Consumers might need updates no more often than every few minutes. In this case, being able to load a data set into memory dramatically speeds access and allows for tremendous scale. This is why, for many projects at Indeed, we distribute a full copy of the needed data to each consumer and render the SQL or NoSQL debate unnecessary. To make this possible, we manage data size using a new key-value store based on minimal perfect hash functions. We’ve implemented this store as a Java library called <a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/mph-table" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indeed MPH</a>.</p>
<h2>The problems with distributing data</h2>
<p>Usually, distributing a full copy of your data to consumers is impractical for two reasons. First, the data must be mostly read-only. Second, the data cannot be so large as to prevent distribution or processing.</p>
<p>You can overcome the first problem by implementing batch updates. Redistribute the data every day, every hour, or even more frequently, and you keep the data read-only while ensuring that it remains useful. However, how do you keep the size down? As it turns out, the same batch update strategy that addresses the first problem also addresses the second.</p>
<h2>Minimal perfect hash functions</h2>
<p>Generating read-only data sets means that we know all the keys for our data set in advance. This lets us apply optimizations to the data set to reduce its size. In the case of hash tables, this knowledge allows us to compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function">perfect hash function</a>.</p>
<p>A perfect hash function maps every element to a distinct integer with no collisions — in mathematical terms it’s an injective function. A minimal perfect hash (mph) function maps <em>n</em> keys to the <em>n</em> consecutive integers [0, <em>n</em>-1]. With such a structure we can guarantee a single disk seek while maintaining 100% load in the table, but as we’ll demonstrate later, there are even more advantages.</p>
<p>Finding such hash functions can be difficult. In fact the Birthday Paradox, described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Wikipedia article</a>, tells us that zero collisions is unlikely even if <em>m</em> is several times larger than <em>n.</em> However, recent advances have yielded efficient techniques (such as described in <a href="http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/havas/TR0242.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/havas/TR0242.pdf">this abstract</a>) and <a href="http://sux.di.unimi.it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://sux.di.unimi.it/">quality libraries</a> for generating minimal perfect hashes. These techniques allow our method to succeed with only a small downside: the resulting hash function itself requires a lookup table of ~2.2 bits per key, so it does not occupy a constant size. However, this lookup table is a fraction of the size of a bloom filter and only requires about 26MB for 100 million entries. In practice, the size of the lookup table is negligible compared to the size of the data being stored.</p>
<h2>Practicalities</h2>
<p>An mph function gives us a mapping from the keys to [0, <em>n</em>-1], but we still need to implement the table. In memory, we’d typically just store the data in an array. To translate this to offline storage we need to make something explicit that programming language arrays make implicit: memory offsets. Our representation is a directory with three files:</p>
<ul>
<li>data.bin: the raw serialized key/value pairs</li>
<li>offsets.bin: a fixed size array where the <em>i</em>th value is the byte offset in data.bin for the entry whose hash is <em>i</em></li>
<li>meta.bin: the serialized hash function itself, along with any other desired metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure shows this representation with an index mapping colors to animals:</p>
<p><a href="http://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph1.png" alt="A representation of explicitly mapping memory offsets using three files." width="506" height="195" srcset="https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph1.png 506w, https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph1-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></a></p>
<p>The file containing the serialized hash requires roughly 2 bits per key, while the file containing the offsets requires 4 bytes. The raw serialized key/value pairs require 46 bytes per key.</p>
<p>One convenience of this representation is that data.bin is raw data available for iterating, independent of the hash function. In addition, we might have multiple hash functions indexing the same data.bin by different keys as long as those keys are always unique.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this representation is with many small entries. In this case, the size of the offsets could be on par with or even larger than the data itself. For an extreme example, if the data contains 750 million mappings from int to half-precision float, we require 7.5e8 * 6 = ~4.2G for data.bin, but 7.5e8 * 8 = ~5.6G for offsets.bin! In this example, we can take advantage of every entry having a fixed size. We don’t need to store the offsets — we can index directly into data.bin. But we want to optimize the variable-sized case as well.</p>
<p>This high cost comes specifically when we’re dealing with small entries. If the entries are large, the size of the offsets are negligible by comparison. Because the total size is small, we can represent it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinct_data_structure" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinct_data_structure">rank (bitcount) data-structure</a>, on the order of bits per entry instead of bytes. For a little more overhead, we can compute the inverse of rank, called select, in constant time on this same data structure. Why is that useful? If the bits are set for the start byte of every entry in data.bin, then finding the offset of the <em>i</em>th entry is just computing select(<em>i</em>).</p>
<p>The structure becomes the following. In this case we now have to sort data.bin by hash value.</p>
<p><a href="http://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph6.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph6.png" alt="A representation of explicitly mapping memory offsets with optimization in the offsets file." width="534" height="324" srcset="https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph6.png 534w, https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph6-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In the optimized structure, the file containing the offsets requires 1.x * 46 bits.</p>
<p>A further optimization comes from the often very regular structure in our data. For instance, to map from a long to list of longs (using a single byte for the count), the size of every individual entry <em>i</em> (including key and value) can be represented as 8<em>xi</em> + 9, assuming the length of the list is <em>xi</em>. The offset of the <em>k</em>th entry becomes ∑(8<em>xi</em> + 9) = 9<em>k</em> + ∑8<em>xi</em> = 9<em>k</em> + 8<em>x</em>. In other words, all we have to store is <em>x</em>, which is much smaller than the actual offset, and a big savings with the select approach. In this case, with 10 million entries averaging 2 elements in the list, the size of data.bin is 10000000 * (9 + 16) = ~250M, but the compressed select method uses only ~2.5M.</p>
<p>Our implementation computes what the size would be with both an array of offsets and the select approach and chooses accordingly.</p>
<h2>More optimizations</h2>
<h3>Throw away the keys!</h3>
<p>If we have no collisions and know that the key we are looking up is in the table, we don’t need to verify it. Alternately, we may be able to validate the key from the value, or from other sources given the value. Finally, if we can accept some small probability of false positive lookups, we can always probabilistically verify whether keys are in the table by using a bloom filter.</p>
<p>We have a better alternative. Since we’ve already hashed to a value that has no collisions in the original key set, we can store a <em>k</em>-bit signature (the low bits of any universal hash will do) of the key. Any key not in the original set that hashes to the same value will only match the signature with probability 2-<em>k</em>. This is a much better error rate than with a bloom filter.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, we can omit the keys entirely from the table. When the values are small, the keys may be a significant fraction, or even the majority of the table.</p>
<h3>Link by hashes, not keys</h3>
<p>It’s common to want to link multiple tables together — the values of one table either are, or contain foreign keys into, another table.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using an mph function is that it compresses keys to a compact integer range. We can store the hash value instead of the key, which for most practical purposes will fit in a 4-byte integer, as opposed to 8-byte longs or larger for many other foreign keys. Not only is this more compact, but it’s also faster to read because we don’t need to re-compute the hash for the second lookup.</p>
<h2>Code and benchmarks</h2>
<p>We’re excited to announce that we’ve open-sourced our mph code. For benchmarks we compare with several open source alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite3</a>: a single-file RDBMS suitable for replication</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">LevelDB</a>: Google’s LSM tree key-value store</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/IndeedEng/lsmtree" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/IndeedEng/lsmtree">lsm</a>: our LSM tree key-value store</li>
<li><a href="http://discodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://discodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">discodb</a>: an immutable key-value store also based on minimal perfect hashing</li>
<li><a href="http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html">TinyCDB</a>: an immutable key-value store using non-perfect hashing</li>
</ul>
<p>Note these options do not have equivalent feature sets. SQLite provides full relational operations, lsm and LevelDB provide range queries, and all three of these are mutable. Here we are concerned only with the common functionality of these options.</p>
<p>We look at the results for two conceptually linked stores based on our production data. This allows us to demonstrate the link by hashing optimization described above, and also enables a more natural representation in SQLite. The first store is a mapping from 50 million 64-bit hashes to a small cluster of “items,” which are 80-bit integers represented as 16-digit base-32 strings. The second store is the reverse mapping from each item in the cluster to its associated hash.</p>
<p>An important aspect of our own key-value stores is their use of arbitrary serialization via a plugin infrastructure. So for a fair comparison, in the sizes for our LSM trees and MPH tables we include both the sizes for opaque string to string mappings, as well as two optimizations. We encode keys as fixed 8-byte long values, and encode the values as short lists of 80-bit integers. For SQLite we encode the keys as integers.</p>

<p>In the general case of string mappings, LevelDB, lsm and mph are all of comparable size, and notably smaller than the alternative solutions. If we apply more efficient serialization lsm and mph become much smaller, and mph is increasingly able to take advantage of the regularity in size to become the smallest option.<a href="http://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2-1024x633.png" alt="A bar graph comparing data size in MB for serializations between several storage methods." width="1024" height="633" srcset="https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2-1024x633.png 1024w, https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2-300x186.png 300w, https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2-768x475.png 768w, https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2-679x420.png 679w, https://rac4ou2q3g246tjk3rxqbt1c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mph2.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Here we consider only the best serialization for lsm and mph. For mph we also show the size with the optimizations discussed above, first not storing the keys and then also linking to the above table via the perfect hash value. For SQLite we include the size when indexing on both columns, which allows us to remove the previous table altogether. In this …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div>  <p><span>27 Feb 2021</span></p><p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan</a> on Hacker News, and I was initially confused, due to a few memories of cross-compilation nightmares: while it should be possible to compile for the same architecture regardless of operating system, wouldn’t the OS get confused by the leading bytes of the executable? I read the <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">article</a> explaining how it works, but most of it went over my head.</p> <p>The example on the <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Github README</a> used the following script for compilation:</p> <div><div><pre><code>gcc <span>-g</span> <span>-O</span> <span>-static</span> <span>-nostdlib</span> <span>-nostdinc</span> <span>-fno-pie</span> <span>-no-pie</span> <span>-mno-red-zone</span> <span>\</span>

  <span>-include</span> cosmopolitan.h crt.o ape.o cosmopolitan.a
objcopy <span>-S</span> <span>-O</span> binary hello.com.dbg hello.com
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I converted it into a simple Makefile to run the compilation commands. I tried a bunch of simple C programs (basic arithmetic, reading and writing to files) on Linux+Windows (compiled on Linux), and all of them worked.</p> <h2 id="compiling-lua-with-cosmopolitan">Compiling Lua with Cosmopolitan</h2> <p>I decided to try compiling a high-level language built on C. I originally picked Python, but the Makefile for Python seemed too complicated to mess with, so I then picked <a href="https://www.lua.org/download.html">Lua</a>, which looked much simpler in comparison.</p> <p>I started out by blindly copy-pasting the flags and includes used in the sample compilation on Github. Ah, it would have been wonderful for my laziness if it compiled out of the box. Following is a play-by-play commentary of trying to compile Lua.</p> <p>First problem I ran into was header clashes: if I didn’t put <code>-nostdlib -nostdinc</code> while compiling each object file, <code>-include cosmopolitan.h</code> would clash with the system headers. But blocking the system headers meant I would have to change every <code>#include</code> of a system header. I created a bunch of dummy headers with the same names as those in the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/header">C stdlib</a> and and included to those instead.</p> <p>Naming clashes: some of the macros in <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> clashed with macro/function names in Lua: <code>reverse</code> and <code>isempty</code>. I changed the Lua source to avoid this.</p> <p>A macro <code>FIRST_RESERVED</code> was broken because <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> was missing. I thought <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> was supposed to be in <code>limits.h</code> – the <code>limits.h</code> part of <code>cosmopolitan.h</code> did not have <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> (It had <code>SCHAR_MAX</code>, though.) I added in a <code>#define</code> stating <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> as <code>__UINT8_MAX__</code> (ie 255).</p> <p>The default Lua Makefile attempts to use <code>_setjmp</code>/<code>_longjmp</code> in <code>ldo.c</code> when on Linux. I disabled the <code>LUA_USE_LINUX</code> flag for compiling the object files, but this caused an issue with <code>tmpnam</code> in <code>loslib.c</code> (<code>mkstemp</code> is available in Cosmopolitan). I changed the Lua source to use <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>. A similar issue showed in <code>lauxlib.c</code> for <code>sys/wait.h</code> (which is a no-op in non-POSIX systems, as per the Lua source code), and in <code>liolib</code> for <code>sys/types.h</code> so disabled <code>LUA_USE_POSIX</code> over there as well.</p> <p>The <code>localeconv()</code> function (part of <code>locale.h</code>) was not implemented in <code>cosmopolitan.h</code>, and this caused an error while compiling <code>lobject.c</code> (macro <code>lua_getlocaledecpoint()</code> depended on <code>localeconv()</code>). Changed the macro to just return <code>'.'</code>.</p> <p>The <code>panic</code> function in Lua <code>static int panic (lua_state*)</code> clashed with that in Cosmopolitan <code>void panic(void)</code>. Renamed the lua function to <code>lua_panic</code>. This triggered an error where the <code>panic</code> function was being called in <code>luaL_newstate</code>, so I changed the name there as well.</p> <p><code>luaL_loadfilex</code> caused a <em>frame size error</em> – I have never seen this before. A quick internet search shows that this is because a large buffer is allocated on stack when entering the function, and yes, <code>luaL_loadfilex</code> allocates a <code>loadF</code> object containing a <code>char</code> buffer of <code>BUFSIZ</code>. I reduced the size of the buffer to <code>BUFSIZ - 64</code>.</p> <p><code>loslib.c</code> reuiqres the <code>setlocale()</code> and <code>LC_*</code> from <code>locale.h</code>, which is defined as an extern value in <code>cosmopolitan.h</code>, but that definition is somehow not enough.. screw it, I just disabled <code>os_setlocale</code> in <code>loslib.c</code>, and then it compiles.</p> <h2 id="linking-the-object-files">Linking the object files</h2> <p>Ok, time for linking …</p> <div><div><pre><code>gcc -std=gnu99 -o lua   lua.o liblua.a -lm -Wl,-E -ldl

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Umm… okay, it looks like some of the functions defined in the cosmopolitan header are yet to be implemented in the static library. That’s okay, I can just quickly fill in the math functions, and I’ll comment out <code>strcoll</code> for now, just because I want to see it compile…. and it successfully compiles!! Let’s run <code>objcopy</code> before trying it out on a system though.</p> <div><div><pre><code>$ objcopy -S -O binary lua lua.exe

-rwxr-xr-x 1 344064 Feb 27 01:39 lua.exe

How about Windows?</p> <p><img src="https://ahgamut.github.io/assets/images/windows_screen.png" alt=""></p> <h2 id="summary-it-is-actually-portable">Summary: it <em>is</em> actually portable</h2> <p>This is pretty incredible: I just had to modify a few lines in a Makefile and some C source files, and I got a Lua executable that works both on Linux and Windows (and possibly others as well). Granted, there are still some details to be filled out (floating point calculation above prints a <code>g</code>), but Cosmopolitan is currently at release 0.0.2, so there is a lot of time.</p> <p>Hopefully this means that other languages that have source code completely in C can also be compiled once and run anywhere. Actually Portable Python next, maybe?</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

      <h2 id="pre-introduction">Pre-introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I stumbled upon and then stumbled upon again on <a href="https://blog.dave.tf/post/new-kubernetes/">David Anderson</a>’s interesting post about “new Kubernetes”, based on a discussion he had with <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a> about what they would do differently if they were rewriting Kubernetes from scratch. Interestingly, a decent part of the proposals for a “new Kubernetes” are design choices made by Hashicorp for <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a>, which is a pretty underrated orchestrator, and drastically simpler ( one of the main goals of said “new Kubernetes”).</p>
<p>Some people are aware that Docker Swarm kinda exists but is abandonware/on life support, and isn’t really recommended anymore, but it still comes up in discussions due to how easy it is to use. For most, that leaves Kubernetes as the only “serious” option, but it is a <em>very</em> complex piece of software, with a lot of moving parts, which isn’t actually required or need in most cases.</p>

<p>This inspired me to write a series on Nomad, what it is, why it’s great, where it’s lacking and how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="introduction---what-is-nomad-and-why-its-great">Introduction - what is Nomad and why it’s great</h2>
<p>Hashicorp’s Nomad is a simple to run and maintain, yet very flexible task scheduler/orchestrator. It relies on plugins for execution, autoscaling and other features, and can run pretty much anything via its <code>task drivers</code> - Docker, contairnerd, LXC, rkt, podman, Java, fork/exec, QEMU, firecracker, FreeBSD jails.</p>
<p>It comes in the form of a single binary, run in two modes (<code>server</code>, in groups of 3 or 5, which make scheduling decisions and host the APIs and configuration, and an unlimited number of <code>worker</code>s which actually run whatever it is you want to run), and can be automatically clustered via <a href="https://consul.io/">Consul</a>. The configuration ( both for jobs and of Nomad itself) is in <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a> (I’ll get into more detail about how great that is a bit later) or JSON (mainly for when the jobs are submitted by machines/scripts/tooling and not humans). Multiple clusters can be connected via <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/federation?in=nomad/manage-clusters">multi-region federation</a> for sharing ACLs and for API forwarding ( you can submit a job or request logs to any server for any region and it will be forwarded to the appropriate server). Deployments can be complex out of the box ( rolling, canary, blue/green), and everything is version controlled and rollbackable.</p>
<p>Like most HashiCorp tools, it’s “open core”, meaning that the majority of features are available in an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad">open source</a> version, and some more advanced/enterprise-y ones ( in Nomad’s case, <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-nomad-multi-cluster-deployment">multi-region/cluster deployments</a> - deploying something simultaneously to multiple separate clusters, policy as code with <a href="https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/nomad">Sentinel</a> and similar ) require upgrading to Nomad Enterprise.</p>
<h2 id="primitives">Primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>job</code> is a declarative file which contains groups of tasks, each task being a container/binary/anything run by an exec driver</li>
<li><code>system</code> jobs (run on all client nodes, equivalent to Kubernetes DaemonSets, for monitoring/logging agents/load balancers)</li>
<li><code>periodic</code> jobs (equivalent to cronjobs)</li>
<li><code>service</code>, which registers as a Consul service and is thus discoverable ( via API or DNS)</li>
<li><code>deployment</code>, each version of a job, they’re tracked and can be rollbacked to</li>
<li><code>allocation</code>, each instance of a task ( group ) on a node</li>
<li><code>namespace</code>, a logical unit to organise jobs in and ACLs around</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jobs">Jobs</h3>
<p>Example of a very basic job that runs a Docker container (<code>jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21</code>), with limits of 1000Mhz of CPU and 1024MB of RAM, and registers the service with Consul:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>job</span> <span>"jaeger"</span> {
        type <span>=</span> <span>"service"</span>
        <span>group</span> <span>"api"</span> {
            <span>task</span> <span>"jaeger"</span> {
                driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
                <span>config</span> { 
                  image <span>=</span> <span>"jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21"</span>
                }
                <span>resources</span> {
                  cpu <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>
                  memory <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>
                }
                <span>service</span> {
                  name <span>=</span> <span>"jaeger-query"</span>
                }
            }
        }            
}
</code></pre></div><p>Note that this is a <em>very</em> basic job, there are no healthchecks, no persistent storage, no extra configuration, no update strategy, no autoscaling, no exposed ports.</p>
<h4 id="deployment-history-and-rollback">Deployment history and rollback</h4>
<p>Nomad tracks each job’s full definitions and deployment history, and allows you to easily rollback and compare them, via the UI, CLI or API, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># List the versions of the job named "opentelemetry-collector"</span>
$ nomad job history opentelemetry-collector
Version     <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
Stable      <span>=</span> false
Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:30:30+01:00

Version     <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
Stable      <span>=</span> true
Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:29:48+01:00

<span># Check the difference between versions</span>
$ nomad job history -p opentelemetry-collector
Version     <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
Stable      <span>=</span> false
Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:30:30+01:00
Diff        <span>=</span>
+/- Job: <span>"opentelemetry-collector"</span>
+/- Task Group: <span>"opentelemetry-collector"</span>
  +/- Task: <span>"opentelemetry-collector"</span>
    +/- Config <span>{</span>
          args<span>[</span>0<span>]</span>:  <span>"--config=local/otel/config.yaml"</span>
      +/- image:    <span>"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.15.0"</span> <span>=</span>&gt; <span>"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.16.0"</span>

          ports<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>: <span>"jaeger_thrift_compact"</span>
        <span>}</span>

Version     <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
Stable      <span>=</span> true
Submit Date <span>=</span> 2021-01-08T21:29:48+01:00

<span># Revert job "opentelemetry-collector" to version 0</span>
$ nomad job revert opentelemetry-collector <span>0</span>

</code></pre></div><h4 id="state-tracking-and-job-planning">State tracking and job planning</h4>
<p>Nomad keeps the desired state and its history, and with <code>nomad job plan</code>, similar to <code>terraform plan</code>, allows us to preview what will change upon applying a new job file. There’s also a feature to verify nothing has changed between the <code>plan</code> and <code>run</code> (equivalent to <code>terraform apply</code> with a plan file) with the <code>-check-index</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ nomad job plan otel.nomad
+/- Job: <span>"otel"</span>
+/- Task Group: <span>"opentelemetry"</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> create/destroy update<span>)</span>
  +/- Task: <span>"opentelemetry-collector"</span> <span>(</span>forces create/destroy update<span>)</span>
    +/- Config <span>{</span>
          args<span>[</span>0<span>]</span>:  <span>"--config=local/otel/config.yaml"</span>
      +/- image:    <span>"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.15.0"</span> <span>=</span>&gt; <span>"otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.20.0"</span>
          ports<span>[</span>0<span>]</span>: <span>"health"</span>
          ports<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>: <span>"jaeger_thrift_compact"</span>
        <span>}</span>
Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

Job Modify Index: <span>413</span>
To submit the job with version verification run:

nomad job run -check-index <span>413</span> otel.nomad

When running the job with the check-index flag, the job will only be run <span>if</span> the
job modify index given matches the server-side version. If the index has
changed, another user has modified the job and the plan<span>'</span>s results are
potentially invalid.
</code></pre></div><p>Overall, it’s a very useful feature, especially when collaborating, locally or via CI/CD.</p>
<h4 id="checking-the-status-and-logs">Checking the status and logs</h4>
<p>To check the status of a job, there are a few commands under <code>nomad job</code> and <code>nomad alloc</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ nomad job status otel
ID            <span>=</span> otel
Name          <span>=</span> otel

<span># logs are at the allocation level ( similar to Kubernetes, where they're at the container level), so we get them with the alloc id</span>
$ nomad alloc logs 89031cfd
<span>[</span>...<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><h4 id="lifecycle-and-sidecars">lifecycle and sidecars</h4>
<p>Nomad allows defining the lifecycle of tasks in task groups, and their status, with the <code>lifecycle</code> stanza. We can have <code>prestart</code> ( for initialisation ), <code>poststart</code> ( companion, for proxying (aka ambassador and adapter pattern in Kubernetes )) or <code>poststop</code> for clean up, and via the <code>sidecar</code> bool we define whether or not it should run as long as the main task(s), e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">  <span>task</span> <span>"init"</span> {
    <span>lifecycle</span> {
      hook <span>=</span> <span>"prestart"</span>
      sidecar <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
    }
    driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
    <span>config</span> {
      image <span>=</span> <span>"alpine/httpie"</span>
      command <span>=</span> <span>"http"</span>
      args <span>=</span> [
        <span>"POST"</span>,
        <span>"https://some-internal-service-for-provisioning-stuff.local/v1/new"</span>,
        "job_id<span>=</span><span>'</span><span>${</span><span>NOMAD_JOB_ID</span><span>}</span><span>!'"</span>
      ]
    }
  }

  <span>task</span> <span>"fluentd"</span> {
    <span>lifecycle</span> {
      hook <span>=</span> <span>"poststart"</span><span> # should start after the main task
</span><span></span>      sidecar <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span> # should run as long as the main task does, and be restarted if it fails
</span><span></span>    }
    driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
    <span>config</span> {
      image <span>=</span> <span>"fluentd/fluentd"</span>
    }
    ...
  }

  <span>task</span> <span>"main-app"</span> {
    ...
  }

  <span>task</span> <span>"cleanup"</span> {
    <span>lifecycle</span> {
      hook <span>=</span> <span>"poststop"</span>
    }
    driver <span>=</span> <span>"docker"</span>
    <span>config</span> {
      image <span>=</span> <span>"alpine"</span>
      command <span>=</span> <span>"rm -rf"</span>
      args <span>=</span> [
        <span>"/var/lib/volume-with-super-secret-data"</span>
      
    }
  }
</code></pre></div><h3 id="aclrbac">ACL/RBAC</h3>
<p>ACL ( access-control list ), or RBAC ( role-based access control ) as it’s known in Kubernetes, allow defining who can do what, so that not everyone with network access can have full administrator privileges and run/stop whatever. Nomad’s ACL system is pretty similar to Consul and Vault’s, and uses JSON ( mostly for non-humans ) or HCL to define <code>policies</code> with <code>rules</code>, which describe what action is allowed on what object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span># a basic policy which allows the predefined read policy with read-only access to list and read:
</span><span># job, volume and scaling details, and extra capabilities for job creation and log access within the default namespace
</span><span></span><span>namespace</span> <span>"default"</span> {
  policy <span>=</span> <span>"read"</span>
  capabilities <span>=</span> [<span>"submit-job","dispatch-job","read-logs"</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>Assignment of policies is done only via the CLI, unlike Kubernetes where that happens in YAML, as does policy management:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># create/update the policy within Nomad</span>
nomad acl policy apply -description <span>"Application Developer policy"</span> my-policy my-policy.hcl
nomad acl token create -name<span>=</span><span>"Test token"</span> -policy<span>=</span>my-policy -type<span>=</span>client
Accessor ID  <span>=</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611746956772/OLz2GztHg.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text">
<p>If you don’t know  <a target="_blank" href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> , it is a javascript runtime like Nodejs but with some changes.</p>
<p>We are not going to talk about the technical aspect here but only the advantages and disadvantages that I have in working with Deno.</p>

<h2 id="write-and-play">Write and play</h2>
<p>With Deno, you no longer need to install packages with package managers like NPM, so no more heavyweight node_modules folder on your computer (and also on your conscience).</p>
<p>Imports are done with Urls which can be either in deno's package manager with versioning, or directly on the git directory of your favorite library.</p>
<p>To illustrate that, here a sample code to start a web server with Deno and  <a target="_blank" href="https://oakserver.github.io/oak/">Oak Server</a> :</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { Application } <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts"</span>;

<span>const</span> app = <span>new</span> Application();

app.use(<span>(<span>ctx</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  ctx.response.body = <span>"Hello world!"</span>;
});

<span>await</span> app.listen(<span>"127.0.0.1:8000"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also run codes that are not on your computer like <a target="_blank" href="https://deno.land/x/nessie@1.1.3">Nessie</a> which lets you perform database migrations directly from the command line with Deno.</p>
<pre><code>deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/nessie/cli.ts init
</code></pre>
<h2 id="typescript">Typescript</h2>
<p>Yes, Deno uses typecript by default for your code writing to avoid many errors, and since typescript is the norm in this perfect world, all libraries written in Deno uses typescript are typed.</p>
<p>And typescript is fully integrated into our IDEs, the code is easier to debug! 😁</p>
<h2 id="webassembly">WebAssembly 👀</h2>
<p>Deno integrates browser APIs and therefore has the WASM API allowing you to use functions written in other languages directly in your code.</p>
<p>I was personally tired of seeing Python run after installing each dependency in my NodeJs projects, it gave an impression of instability and that’s verified by running a code on different OS ...</p>
<p>But it's resolved as WASM is universal and standardized!</p>
<h2 id="browser-apis">Browser APIs</h2>
<p>Deno has (again) a big advantage, that offering browser APIs to make the javascript development environment more homogeneous with front-end javascript development.</p>
<p>For example : the standardized function " <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch</a> " is available with Deno.</p>
<h2 id="custom-formatter">Custom Formatter</h2>
<p>Deno integrates a custom formatter to make the code in your project between each developer more homogeneous with the <code>deno fmt</code> command</p>

<p>I only see 2 problems using Deno :</p>
<h2 id="instability">Instability</h2>
<p>Since Deno is still young, the libraries and the runtime may have bugs.</p>
<p>I have often had to spend long hours debugging my code to fix crashes.</p>
<p>Often due to a bad cache or a version change in a dependency or runtime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the more we advance in time, the more stable Deno is and the libraries also with a strong open source community.</p>
<p>For example, I have more easily participated in open source projects using the deno runtime to improve them than NodeJs.</p>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>The number of available libs is still quite low, again due to Deno's age, but this number is increasing day by day (javascript ecosystem, lol)!</p>

<p>In the end, I use Deno whenever I have to do something other than frontend, instead of using NodeJs, if the library I want to use doesn't exist, then I create it and make it public to help other people.</p>
<p>And I learned a lot from the open-source community by operating like this!</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) has released an AI overclocking tool on BIOS, which allows the PC users who are not experienced in overclocking to overclock the CPU and boost the operating system performance.</p>



<p>I am using a ROG Z390 MAXIMUS XI HERO (WI-FI) motherboard and an Intel i9-9900K CPU. In this blog post, I would like to share my experience with the ROG AI overclocking on Linux.</p>

<h3 id="benchmark-tools">Benchmark Tools</h3>

<p>Here are some benchmark tools that are available on Linux.</p>

<h4 id="blender">Blender</h4>

<p>Blender has a benchmark tool called <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Open Data</a>, which allows you to benchmark your CPU or GPU.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget https://opendata.blender.org/cdn/BlenderBenchmark2.0/launcher/benchmark-launcher-2.0.5-linux.tar.gz
$ tar xvf benchmark-launcher-2.0.5-linux.tar.gz 
$ ./benchmark-launcher 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Blender is also a free and open source 3D creation suite. We could install it on Ubuntu using the following command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install blender
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="prime95">Prime95</h4>

<p>Before ROG AI overclocking, the stabilized CPU clock speed for all 8 cores of my i9-9900K during OpenSSL benchmarking was around 4.1-4.2 GHz. After ROG AI overclocking, it became 4.6-4.7 GHz.</p>



<p>For i9-9900KS, I believe it is possible to overclock all 8 cores to 5.0 GHz.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This post has been discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26291054#26294846">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/luawx6/rust_zig_and_the_futility_of_replacing_c/"><code>/r/rust</code></a>, and
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/1iiifg"><code>lobste.rs</code></a>.</p><p>I should not have posted this to Hacker News on a Saturday night right before
going to bed, but in my defense, this post blew up in a way I didn’t expect.</p></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>There was a recent <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771">dust-up on GitHub</a> surrounding the decision by the
<a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">Cryptography library</a> (which I will call <code>cryptography</code> for convenience) to
switch to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>One of the distro maintainers of my distro of choice, <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, filed a bug
report with the <code>crytography</code> saying that the switch broke builds on several
platforms that Gentoo still supports. The <code>cryptography</code> authors replied that
those platforms are not really used anymore, and that they were going to stick
with Rust because it has better memory safety than C. They also argued that it
is better to force better programming languages on people because of better
security.</p><p>At first glance, it appears that the better argument is on the side of the
<code>cryptography</code> maintainers, but after thinking about it carefully, I think they
are wrong.</p><h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2><p>There are a few reasons why I believe the <code>cryptography</code> maintainers are at
fault.</p><h3 id="due-diligence">Due Diligence</h3><p>First, their argument for Rust (and against C) because of memory safety implies
that they have not done due diligence in finding and fixing such bugs.</p><p>I can almost hear the rage of my readers against that paragraph above and
against the fact that I don’t have a commenting system on my blog. So let me
answer the comments preemptively.</p><p>“They are volunteers, giving their time away for free!”</p><p>Yes, but they also <em>intend</em> for their code to be used widely. They managed to
succeed in that, so they now have some obligation to their users.</p><p>“They don’t have any obligation!”</p><p>If a software project actively goes out and gets users, which just about any
project with a serious number of users has done, then yes, they have an
obligation to those users. The reason is that they sold users on the idea of
using their software. In other words, they were marketing their software, which
means making promises.</p><p>In fact, when people release <em>libraries</em> and try to get users for them, it’s
<em>because</em> they want them to be used by downstream programmers. A programmer
might write a program to scratch an itch and release it, but that reasoning
applies much less to libraries, in my opinion.</p><p>“Okay, but they didn’t get anything in return, so there’s still no obligation.”</p><p>In return, the users gave them <strong>relevance</strong>.</p><p>One of the most vocal (in favor of Rust) developers of <code>cryptography</code> works for
Red Hat Security Engineering (if I read his GitHub profile right). I don’t know
if his work on <code>cryptography</code> helped him get that job, but it might have.</p><p>Another of the most vocal developers has a computer security company. I would
bet money that his work on <code>cryptography</code> gives his company relevance.</p><p>So they did <em>not</em> get “nothing” from users. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>By the way, this position comes from my own experience pushing my <a href="https://git.yzena.com/gavin/bc"><code>bc</code></a>. I
managed to convince the FreeBSD project to <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/tree/main/contrib/bc">make it the default</a> in FreeBSD
13.</p><p>Once I did that, I shouldered, willingly, the need to keep FreeBSD happy. And
while I have made mistakes, I have done well so far.</p><p>And with my <code>bc</code>, <strong>I did my due diligence with memory safety</strong>. I fuzzed my
<code>bc</code> and eliminated all of the bugs. I even run the generated fuzzer test cases
through AddressSanitizer, and my entire test suite is run through Valgrind
<em>and</em> AddressSanitizer. I also add failing fuzzer cases to my test suite, which
means I run more and more test cases through both of those frightfully
effective tools.</p><p>For the record, those tools are only effective with effective test suites, which
I spent a lot of time building. But <em>building</em> such a test suite is part of due
diligence itself.</p><p>So it follows that if the developers have <em>not</em> done their due diligence, their
users should <strong>leave</strong>, either by forking the project or creating a new one.
The relevance they gave to the <code>cryptography</code> authors should disappear.</p><h3 id="battle-tested-c-code">Battle-Tested C Code</h3><p>In fact, I have done enough due diligence with my <code>bc</code> that I would consider it
a dereliction of duty to Rewrite It in Rust (RIIR).</p><p>Why would it be a dereliction of duty? Because rewriting it in Rust would cause
<em>more</em> bugs, not less. This is because of several reasons:</p><ol><li>I would need to <em>redesign</em> it to fit the language.</li><li>I would need to <em>reimplement</em> it, and new implementations always have bugs.</li><li>The C code is battle-tested, both by me (using fuzzing and other techniques)
and by users.</li></ol><p>That last point is the most crucial, especially in the case of <code>cryptography</code>.</p><p>If the developers of <code>cryptography</code> claim that they have, in fact, done their
due diligence with regards to memory safety in their C code, then they are
claiming that it’s battle-tested.</p><p>The saying that “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,” and in this case,
<em><strong>if</strong></em> the <code>cryptography</code> developers are claiming that they have done their
due diligence, they are throwing away a bird in the hand for a single one in the
bush.</p><div><p><strong>Edit (28 Feb 2021)</strong>: This part of the post seems to be misunderstood widely,
so I am going to attempt to clarify.</p><p>People are arguing that having safe C code requires a frozen, small codebase
with a thorough test suite. And then they debate my position based on the belief
that the codebase needs to evolve.</p><p>For the record, I agree with them that in order to have safe C code, the
codebase must be small and frozen.</p><p>What I am arguing is that <strong>crypto</strong> code <em>should</em> be small and frozen, with a
thorough test suite. I wrote about that <a href="https://gavinhoward.com/2019/11/finishing-software/">here</a>.</p></div><p>And if that’s the case, their users should <strong>leave</strong> and take <code>cryptography</code>'s
relevance with them.</p><h3 id="desktops-and-smartphones-are-not-the-only-computers">Desktops and Smartphones Are Not the Only Computers</h3><p>The users of <code>cryptography</code> were claiming in the bug report discussion that Rust
is not portable to many platforms, and the authors said that they don’t have the
time or resources to target those platforms. Fair enough.</p><p>But then they claim that the <em>users</em> should put in the effort to port Rust to
their platforms. This is wrong.</p><p>The <code>cryptography</code> authors also claim that the platforms that Rust doesn’t
support do not matter. As we will see below, this is false.</p><p>While I agree that the <code>cryptography</code> authors are not responsible for porting
Rust to other platforms, the users of those platforms are not either.</p><p>That responsibility falls on the Rust developers.</p><p><em>They</em> were the ones who sold Rust to those who have used it, so as above,
<em>they</em> have the responsibility for supporting their users.</p><p>Granted, the Rust developers have made no claim about being portable to every
platform. But they <em>have</em> claimed that it is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded">appropriate for embedded
software</a>.</p><p>If it were true, this would be great. After all, <a href="https://youtu.be/3HxPzutkNYw?t=257">IoT devices outnumber
desktops and smartphones by at least one order of magnitude</a>.</p><p>But there are a lot of them that LLVM, Rust’s backend, cannot generate code
for. In fact, there are a lot of them that <em>C++</em> cannot run on.</p><div><p><strong>Edit (28 Feb 2021)</strong>: Also, the Rust developers are the developers with the
most experience reading ISA manuals knowing how to make a compiler generate
code. So they are still the best placed to support those “esoteric”
architectures.</p><p>And if they do not know how to read ISA manuals and generate code, it’s because
they lean too heavily on LLVM.</p></div><p>Make no mistake; embedded software is still running the majority of devices in
the world. And C is the king of embedded software.</p><p>I don’t know exact numbers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of
programmable devices in the world cannot run Rust.</p><p>Thus, because Rust uses LLVM, it is not portable.</p><p>And in my opinion, Rust is not appropriate for the embedded space.</p><p>So in this case, I would consider that the <code>cryptography</code> developers were
victims of the Rust developers.</p><h3 id="gcc-is-not-the-only-compiler"><code>gcc</code> Is Not the Only Compiler</h3><p>That isn’t the only problem.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">project to make <code>gcc</code> able to compile Rust</a>. That’s commendable.</p><p>However, many people seem to believe that once it’s done, Rust will be portable.
That is not the case.</p><p>Why? Simple: <strong><code>gcc</code> is not the only compiler</strong>.</p><p>There is plenty of code out there that uses dead simple C compilers, like
<a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a>, <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">sdcc</a>, and others. And often, they have <a href="https://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2012/06/optimizing-for-the-cpu-compiler/">good reason to do
so</a>.</p><p>Adding a <code>gcc</code> frontend, while it will improve the situation, will not make Rust
as portable as C. Period.</p><h3 id="pushing-for-progress-hinders-it">Pushing for Progress Hinders It</h3><p>The other thing that the <code>cryptography</code> authors claim is that their users who
refuse to adopt Rust are hindering progress.</p><p>That may be true, but it is also true that forcing “progress” on others hinders
<em>true</em> progress.</p><p>By forcing users to either adopt Rust or pin their dependency on <code>cryptography</code>
to the most recent version without it, they are forcing those users to use
stagnant code.</p><p>Isn’t that the very opposite of progress?</p><h2 id="cryptography-at-fault"><code>cryptography</code> at Fault</h2><p>Those reasons lay out why I think the <code>cryptography</code> authors should shoulder the
blame for this situation, and I think I can explain where they went wrong.</p><ol><li>They let ideology come before pragmatic engineering.</li><li>They sold <code>cryptography</code> to users.</li><li>They knew that switching to Rust would break existing users and did it
anyway.</li><li>They either did not do their due diligence for memory safety, or they did
and threw that battle-tested code out.</li></ol><h2 id="portability">Portability</h2><p>To be honest, I used to think that it was better to switch to a better language
than C.</p><p>I had several talks with Linux distro maintainers, as well as a talk with my
father-in-law, that convinced me that C’s portability is still important enough
that it should be used.</p><p>Unless, of course, you <em>explicitly</em> target only certain platforms. But you had
better be prepared to never target others.</p><p>In fact, after talking with the distro maintainers, who have had to build Rust,
I am also convinced that it’s not just about being portable, it’s also about how
<em>easy</em> it is to <em>build</em> software.</p><p>Rust’s bootstrap is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">complicated</a>, and it is one of the worst things about
it.</p><p>If building software in Rust means building Rust for a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">Tier 3</a> platform,
you can bet that <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/09/Rust-move-fast-and-break-things.html">people will stick with C</a>.</p><h3 id="zig">Zig</h3><p>I want to take a moment to talk about Zig.</p><p>Zig might be one of the most promising up-and-coming languages of recent memory.</p><p>But it will ultimately fail to reach its goal.</p><p>You see, Zig is meant to replace C. But …</p></div></div>

I just resurrected and cleaned up an old tool I had lying around. It's now nice
and usable by others. This tool loads terrain data, and renders it from the
ground, simulating what a human or a camera would see. This is useful for
armchair exploring or for identifying peaks. This was relatively novel when I
wrote it &gt;10 years ago, but there are a number of similar tools in existence
now. <i>This</i> implementation is still useful in that it's freely licensed and
contains APIs, so fancier processing can be performed on its output.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><main><article><div><p>There's been an explosion of people creating communities on the internet. I've thought about them a lot, and wrote this to compile some of those thoughts in a single document.</p><p>What is a community? For my purposes, I’ve found a useful definition.</p><blockquote><p>A group of people, united by a shared passion or purpose, who interact with each other.</p></blockquote><p>Looking at the definition, there are only two things a community needs.</p><ul><li>A shared passion or purpose</li><li>People interacting with each other</li></ul><p>Here’s some examples of communities:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Community</th><th>Shared passion/purpose</th><th>People interacting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Your high school</td><td>Learn (apparently)</td><td>Talking in classrooms, lunches, groupchats</td></tr><tr><td>React developers</td><td>Using the same language, interested in the development of the language</td><td>Tweeting at each other, reddit, forums</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The strength of a community, then, comes from the strength of this shared passion/purpose and the depth and frequency of interactions. And so, a useful formula for measuring the strength of a community could be:</p><p><span></span> = strength of the passion/ideal</p><p><span></span> = the ith connection</p><p><span></span> = the depth of the ith connection</p><p>We can come up with a few interesting observations through this formula.</p><ul><li><p>Notice that this definition doesn’t talk about technology or the platform used to bring these people together. <strong>Putting people into a group chat doesn’t make it a community.</strong> In fact, a group chat isn’t even necessary to build a community. There’s clearly a React developer community on the internet, but there isn’t any specific platform or group chat they congregate at. In that sense, communities can be thought of as the superset of the platform they exist on. A single community can use many platforms to interact with each other, but the discord server or slack channel they use isn’t the community itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>The strength of the shared passion/purpose acts as a force multiplier on the connections in a community.</strong> If there is no shared P, the community has no strength. Getting people together who don’t have a shared passion is the same thing as putting a bunch of random people in a group chat and calling it a community.</p></li><li><p><strong>It’s much easier to connect with people who have the same values and passions as you do, so the stronger P is, the stronger every single connection is right at the outset.</strong> So (somewhat obviously), the more passionate people are, the easier is it so make a community with them. Conversely, without a strong shared ideal, it’ll be very difficult to get people to interact and form deep connections.</p></li><li><p>The shared purpose can even be something as trivial as having to be in the same place at the same time. But if you’ve left high school, you’ll notice how you probably haven’t kept in touch with 90% of the people you knew, even if it felt like you knew them really well during your time there. That leads us to another important point- <strong>there is a hierarchy of shared experiences that bring people together.</strong> You didn’t keep in touch simply because the strength of your connection was based on location, which is very weak compared to shared passions or experiences.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/hierarchy.jpeg" alt="shared purpose hierarchy"></p><p>A community with a few deeply passionate people is much stronger than one with many shallow ones. You’d think that it’s merely the area under the curve (connections x depth of connections), but there’s a third dimension here-  P would likely be much higher in communities with deeper connections, making those communities stronger.</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/3d.jpeg" alt="3d graph of P, depth and connections"></p><p>Notice that frequency of interaction is not a factor at all. It’s only useful to the extent that it increases the depth of relationships in a community- beyond that, it doesn’t make a difference.</p><p>Think of your closest group of friends. You could meet them all after months and you’d still feel the same sense of community you did before. The strength of your connection superseded the need to constantly interact. And so, the DAUs of a community is a terrible way to measure its strength. This is not to say it doesn’t matter, just that while frequent interactions may lead to deep connections, deep connections don’t necessarily mean frequent interactions.</p><h2>Who’s a community for?</h2><p>The need for deep connections means that communities specifically built for the internet can only fulfill a certain set of users.</p><p>The issue is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a>. Humans can only maintain ~150 deep connections, and the vast majority of these are taken up by in person relationships. But to make online communities, you need people to make strong relationships. So, in a sense, you need people with enough ‘mental social capacity’ to form those deep relationships with people online.</p><p>This required ‘mental social space’ means that online communities need to cater to people who are missing some sort of social interaction offline. And so, they need to find a way to offer connections that people cannot find in person.</p><p>From a social lens, the internet is an aggregation of extremes. It allows everyone in the long tail to suddenly have an abundance of people like them. This means that people with unconvential interests who couldn't find their people in person, can do so online. So the the gamer, the programmer, the digital artist in school- they don’t need to feel so different anymore.</p><p>For example, I’ve been interested in startups for years now, and after bingeing <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/podcast/">YC’s podcasts</a>, I realised that I needed a way to find people with the SV mindset. Twitter allowed me to find many people my age with similar interests, <a href="https://twitter.com/sarvasvkulpati/status/1247181074611851267?lang=en">Enlite</a> allowed me to meet a bunch of really interesting people, and interning at <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> gave me a glimpse of what it’s like to work at startups. All of these happened without meeting a single one of of these people in person.</p><p><a href="https://hackclub.com/">HackClub</a> is a perfect example of a community that’s built to cater to a group of people who miss some sort of social interaction offline. It’s still strangely difficult to find kids who are interested in coding and building things, and Hack Club fills that gap by giving young hackers an online community of people just like them. It works so well because it manages to both</p><ul><li>Cater to highly passionate people</li><li>Cater to people who don’t usually find their communities in person</li></ul><h2>Building strong community</h2><p>While finding many people with a high P is a prerequisite, you need to then get them to interact with each other, to weave the web of connections that form the thing you’ll call your community. When you first bring people together, each individuals connections will look like this:</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/connections.jpeg" alt="a graph of connections against depth"></p><p>Each member will have fairly weak connections with all the other members.The mistake I made when I first started Enlite was thinking that putting a bunch of people in a slack channel would mean that all of them interact with every other member all the time. That wasn’t the case. Instead, a small, core group of people emerged.</p><p>When you’re in school, you’ll notice that cliques naturally form. No amount of social engineering would get the jocks to suddenly integrate with the nerds. Similarly, the formation of cliques in a community is pretty normal, and in fact, is a great thing. It means people are falling into subsets of others they are comfortable with.</p><p>However, you don’t want insulated cliques. While there should be strong connections within them, they should also be connected to each other. Should this succeed, your community will look like this:</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/graph.jpeg" alt="network of members in a community"></p><p>Any individual in your community will end up with a T shaped profile- many fairly shallow connections, a few very deep ones. The width of the stem would depend on the number of online friends they mentally have space to make as well as their success with connecting to people within the community.</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/depth.jpeg" alt="depth"></p><p>Much like any social product, Enlite has a retention curve, and about a third are still active. An interesting observation is that the members who initially attended the most video calls are the ones who are now the most active in chat. My theory is that they acquired the best relationships and so, felt incentivised to talk and share opinions and progress on projects.</p><h2>Creating strong connections</h2><p>But how do you facilitate creating these strong connections? Something I’ve noticed is that every relationship: teacher-student, parent-child, friend-friend, follows a timeline</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/friendGraph.jpeg" alt="friendship timeline"></p><p>In a sense, the depth of a relationship could be measured by how much a pair knows and understands about what makes the other tick. You could have a wild drinking buddy and always have fun but unless you have some deep conversations, you don’t have a deep relationship. To increase the depth of the relationship quickly, you need to increase the bandwidth of communication- doing so allows both people to understand each other faster, and so, speeds up the timeline of the relationship.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/aadillpickle">Aadil</a> and I followed each other on twitter for a while. I saw his tweets, he saw mine, sometimes we interacted with each other. But then, when making Enlite, I got on a zoom call with him. Within 30 minutes, we were much, much better friends. It felt like the amount our friendship progressed in a few months of interacting with each other on Twitter was repeated several times over in 1 zoom call.</p><p>Of course, different mediums have different bandwidth, but there’s a tradeoff- the higher the bandwidth, the higher the barrier of entry. Scheduling a zoom call, for example, is much harder than sending a Twitter DM.</p><p><img src="https://sarvasvkulpati.com/bars.jpeg" alt="bar charts of communication mediums compared"></p><p>In this sense, audio is probably best placed at the intersection of bandwidth and friction. On audio calls, you don’t need to care about how you look, you don’t need to constantly stay in a ‘switched on’ state and stare at the camera throughout, and it’s much easier to hop on and off. This is probably why platforms like Discord and Clubhouse are growing so fast as a tool to grow communities.</p><h2>A summary</h2><p>In conclusion:</p><ul><li>Communities = passion x interaction x strength of interactions</li><li>You don't need a group chat for a community, and putting people into a group chat doesn't make it one</li><li>Communities need to cater for connections people don't find in person</li><li>Creating connections requires a high bandwidth of communication. When in doubt, choose video</li><li>Frequent activity doesn't necessarily mean a strong community</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>Here is a number to remember:&nbsp; .994 (and not because 994 is the country
telephone code for Azerbaijan).</p>



<p>The measure of poverty most commonly used by the World Bank is the “headcount”: the proportion of people below a poverty line,  a fixed level of income or consumption expenditures (CEX) per capita. &nbsp;The Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1986) measures of poverty are weighted sums of people from a given distribution of consumption expenditures (or income), and the headcount is the simple case where the weights are equal for each person, irrespective of how far from the poverty line their CEX is. </p>



<p>This leads to a simple question:&nbsp; “How much of the  observed variation in headcount poverty rates across countries is due to variation in the median of the distribution of consumption expenditures?”&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The answer, shown in Figure 1, is (roughly) “All of
it.”&nbsp; The R-Squared of the median (with
various powers to account for non-linearity) for explaining headcount poverty
for the three poverty lines is: </p>



<ul><li>$5.50 per day, R-Squared=.988,
correlation(poverty, predicted)=.994</li><li>$3.20 per day, R-Squared=.988, correlation(poverty,
predicted)=.994</li><li>$1.90 per day, R-Squared=.983,
correlation(poverty, predicted)=.991 </li></ul>



<p>The simple correlation between the actual $3.20/day or $5.50/day headcount poverty rate and headcount poverty as predicted using only the median of the country distribution is .994 and for $1.90 it is .991.&nbsp; These are about as high a correlation as real world data can produce.&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>Figure 1:&nbsp; Headcount poverty rates are extremely highly associated with median consumption expenditures </strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="353" src="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png 749w, https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure>



<p><em>Source:&nbsp;
Author’s calculations based on data from:&nbsp; “</em><a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povDuplicateWB.aspx">PovcalNet:
the on-line tool for poverty measurement developed by the Development Research
Group of the World Bank</a>”</p>



<p>The regression uses the 389 country/time observations from
the World Bank data that are based on consumption expenditures (not income) and
recent data (not distant extrapolations). Since headcount poverty is a partial
integral of a distribution of consumption expenditures the relationship between
the median and headcount has to be non-linear.&nbsp;
I use powers of the median from -2 to 5 to allow for flexible
non-linearity. </p>



<p>Nancy Birdsall and Christian Meyer have argued that for
development issues “<a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/median-message-good-enough-measure-material-well-being-and-shared-development-progress">The
Median is the Message</a>.” &nbsp;For headcount
poverty they are <em>completely</em> right. &nbsp;The answer to the question:&nbsp; “Why does a country at a given time have
headcount poverty rate it does?” is “Because of its median of consumption
expenditure.” Pretty much full stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditional on the median, any and all other factors
or variables can explain <em>at most</em> 1.2
percent of the variation in country headcount poverty rates (maybe 0, but <em>at most </em>1.2). &nbsp;</p>



<p>You might be saying, “Lant, why are you making such a big
deal of this correlation?”&nbsp; Well, thanks
for asking.&nbsp; </p>



<p>This very tight correlation is not built in.&nbsp; One can usefully decompose (as many have done)
the difference in poverty rates comparing two distributions (between countries
or over time) into three elements on the (mostly accurate) assumption the
distribution is log-normal (that is, the natural log of consumption
expenditures is distributed as a Gaussian normal distribution):</p>



<ol><li>Differences in the central tendency of the log-normal distribution,</li><li>Differences in the variance of the log-normal distribution and</li><li>Differences in the distribution below the poverty line being more or less favorable to poverty than would be expected of a log-normal of a given central tendency and variance (as the log-normal is a two-parameter distribution this forces an exact shape).</li></ol>



<p>How much of the variance in headcount poverty is an
empirical fact that depends on the actual distributions of consumption
expenditures across countries and the fact that (2) and (3) account for 1.2
percent of the variance could have been otherwise, it is not cooked into
definitions.&nbsp; In fact, one can easily
imagine policies or programs that would bring up the lower tail, and hence
reduce poverty, much more than the log-normal would predict.&nbsp; So it is a striking finding that <em>both </em>differences in variance
(inequality) with the assumption of log-normality and deviations from
log-normality below the poverty line <em>together
</em>account for at most 1.2 percent of observed variation in poverty.</p>



<p>Included in the country/time varying factors whose variation
in the observed data <em>cannot</em> explain
more than 1.2 percent of the observed variation in headcount poverty rates are
things like: “budget (government or other) devoted to anti-poverty programs”
and “efficacy of the design of anti-poverty programs” or “whether the country’s
anti-poverty programs are ‘evidence based’” or, for that matter, any
interaction of those factors, like:&nbsp;
“whether a country devoted budget to well-designed anti-poverty programs
based on evidence.”&nbsp; The median explains
nearly all variation in poverty across countries with no reference to targeted
programs of any kind: not micro-credit, not conditional cash transfers, not
chickens, not livelihood programs, nothing that claims to impact poverty
without changing the median. </p>



<p>Given the amount of time, energy, intellectual firepower, academic
publication, and advocacy that go into discussions of anti-poverty <em>programs</em> one might think they are a
large part of the “solution” to global poverty.&nbsp;
But they just have not been.&nbsp; If
your median consumption expenditure went up then your headcount poverty went
down and <em>nothing</em> else that any
country has done besides that seems to be very important in explaining poverty
reduction.</p>



<p>The relative importance of growth of median consumption expenditures versus “all else” can be illustrated with two different poverty lines at two different levels of income, the “extreme poverty” penurious poverty line that the World Bank often uses (but which I think is fundamentally <a href="http://www.effective-states.org/the-mdgs-were-a-disaster-meet-lant-pritchett/">illegitimate</a> as it is too low) and the “$5.50/day” line (which I think is still too low).</p>



<p>The predicted level of $1.90/day “extreme poverty” for a
country at the average income of the lowest quartile of countries is 72.2%.&nbsp; If its poverty rate were better by one
standard deviation of the residual conditional on the median it would fall to
only 68.6 percent.&nbsp; Even if it had the
best poverty conditional on its median for any country in the bottom quartile
it would fall by about 10 percentage points to 62.7 percent.&nbsp; In contrast, if that country grew by two
percent a year for 20 years (which is roughly the average growth in the post
WWII era) poverty would fall to 35.9 percent—about in half.&nbsp; If it grew at 4 percent per capita for 20
years (this is about one standard deviation above the average growth of 2
percent) predicted headcount poverty would fall to 12.1%.&nbsp; Sustaining rapid growth starting from a low
median consumption expenditures reduces poverty <em>50 percentage points</em> more than having the <em>best</em> observed poverty conditional on the low median.&nbsp; With sustained growth <em>half the population </em>moves out of extreme poverty compared to 10
percent even the <em>best</em> observed
poverty with stagnant income (and just to be clear, the data here don’t tell
what accounts for these observed low poverty rates conditional on the median). </p>



<p><strong>Figure 2:&nbsp; Even getting to the best headcount poverty for a given median expenditures versus the average produces a small gain relative to the poverty reduction from sustained growth of the median</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="481" height="289" src="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1.png 481w, https://lantpritchett.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-1-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px"></figure>



<p>I do the same exercise with the second quartile of income
and the $5.50/day poverty line, with roughly the same results.&nbsp; Even the best performance for poverty
conditional on median produces gains much, much, smaller than the gains in
poverty reduction from sustained rapid growth.</p>



<p>The results of these regressions are just facts about the
world and do not directly reveal causal structures.&nbsp; In particular, there may well be cost
effective poverty reducing programs that merit support by governments and/or
philanthropists.&nbsp; The cross-national
correlations can only speak to what <em>have been</em>
the correlates of poverty, not <em>what could
be.&nbsp; </em>But, while one doesn’t want to
over-interpret facts, neither does one want to under-fact interpretations of
very specific and particular empirical findings about specific programs
either.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The next time you hear the phrase “solve global poverty” remember the number: .994.&nbsp; If what follows “solve global poverty” isn’t about raising median consumption expenditures a very good question is: “why not?”</p>



<p>(This blog is titled “Part I” because I plan a Part II that
does a bit more on the technical issues of these types of decompositions and a
Part III that discusses a bit the broader implications.&nbsp; But, unlike the Lord of the Rings (in which
all three were filmed at the same time) these are not yet written and the
future is unpredictable).</p>

<p>It begins in October 1927, with a single camera exhibited in Moscow at an Exposition of Photographic Technique in the new Soviet capital, Moscow. Bostelman’s camera is a small 35mm camera with a simple, single-speed shutter and a winding key to advance the film. The camera’s back is removable, and removing it turns the rest of the camera into an enlarger which can be used to make prints.</p>
<p>It never makes it into production, but Bostelman’s simple snap-shooter is the first Soviet camera. What comes after this is first a trickle, and then a flood.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, and the Soviet camera industry is the second-largest in the world – second only to Japan, whose bands such as Nikon, Canon, Minolta Olympus and Pentax have become household names. The Soviet Union has its own heavyweights, and between them they have churned out dozens and then hundreds of different camera designs as the decades tick by.</p>
<p>Thanks to a mix of espionage, war reparations, ingenious design and a desire to show the West a thing or two, the USSR’s camera makers come up with a Soviet answer to almost every camera type made in the West, though not necessarily at the same time. Soviet designers devised a myriad of different models, some of the brutishly simple, others showing real flair and ingenuity.</p>
<p>Odd, then, that the entirety of a photographic industry spread across the largest country ever formed and spanning more than 60 years can get judged off first impressions. In the last 20 years, I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen people declaim the quality of all Soviet cameras based off a single flea-market <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2018/12/zenit-e-russian-camera-review/">Zenit-E</a> which might have mouldering in someone’s basement for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>This is something I’ve learned having spent the last 20 years collecting and using Soviet cameras. The first one I came across was a Soviet-era <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2017/06/lomo-lc-a-cameras-lc-wide-lca-120/">Lomo LC-A</a> compact in a camera shop in London’s West End; a solid black rectangle with surprising heft and exotic Cyrillic lettering. That Lomo sparked an enduring love for film cameras of all shapes and sizes, and a particular interest in those made behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, where I grew up, Soviet cameras were almost unknown. But that wasn’t the case in Western Europe. The boom years of the Soviet photographic industry during the Cold War coincided with a new age of prosperity and consumerism west of Berlin. More people had the money and time to travel, and they wanted cameras with which to document it. The Soviet Union wanted hard currency and had a smorgasbord of cameras that could be sold at subsidised prices. Along with the Praktica cameras of East Germany’s vast Pentacon, Soviet cameras appealed to a huge swathe of photographers with a limited budget.</p>

<p>This article – and it’s a big one, so get a drink handy – is an attempt to dispel some of the myths that have developed around Soviet cameras, especially since the 1990s. It’s not trying to pretend that it’s only politics got in the way of the USSR’s cameras, and that every Zenit and Zorki is a match for a Nikon or a Leica. Some of the horror stories you might have heard about Soviet camera quality are 100% true. But not every Soviet camera is a lemon, and some are capable of taking fantastic images if you take the trouble to learn their strengths and, yes, their weaknesses.</p>

<h4><span id="The_big_five"></span><strong>The big five</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>But first, a little history.</p>
<p>The Soviet camera industry was dominated by five big names: <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/KMZ"><strong>KMZ</strong></a> (<em>Krasnogorskiy Mechanicheskiy Zavod</em>) in Moscow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOMO"><strong>Lomo</strong></a> in St Petersburg, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_(brand)"><strong>Kiev-Arsenal</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FED_(camera)"><strong>FED</strong></a> in Ukraine and <a href="https://vintagecameralab.com/brand/mmz/"><strong>MMZ</strong></a> (the home of BelOMO) in what is now Belarus. Some of these bureaus concentrated on one particular style of camera – FED, for instance, became known for Leica-copy rangefinders they started making in the 1930s and they were kept in production until almost the end of the Soviet Union itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/Z8Z2KH28" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi2.png?v=0" alt="Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com" height="36"></a> <em>Found this guide useful?

<p>The cameras created ranged from rudimentary compacts simple enough for children to ambitious designs intended to compete with the very best the West had to offer. The latter were a kind of photographic soft power – with no internal market to pay top dollar for them, the higher-spec cameras were touted as evidence of Soviet ingenuity and engineering prowess</p>
<figure id="attachment_22492" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22492"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kosmofoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zenite4-e1590396414210.jpg" alt="Zenit-e (Pic: Stephen Dowling)" width="2000" height="1500"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22492">The Zenit-E is the most-produced 35mm SLR in history (Pic: Stephen Dowling)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much simpler cameras were made in Soviet industrial quantities: million after million. This model became the dominant one from the mid 1970s. Camera designers were no longer urged to make cameras to compete with the best of the West, but to tweak tried-and-trusted designs a little each time. You can see this in the successive designs that came after the ubiquitous Zenit-E SLR and Lomo’s simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smena_(camera)">Smena viewfinder camera</a>. Despite cosmetic changes on the outside, underneath little changed from camera to camera.</p>
<p>A leading Soviet camera collector named Viktor Suglob recently produced a Russian-language book called ‘<a href="http://ussrphoto.com/Wiki/default.asp?WikiCatID=39&amp;ParentID=4&amp;ContentID=311&amp;Item=1200+Cameras+from+USSR+by+Suglob%2C+Shaternik%2C+Kochergin">1200 Soviet Cameras</a>’, an encyclopaedia of almost every prototype and production camera devised over nearly 75 years of the USSR. Many of these, of course, were never produced beyond a few samples or pre-production models. But hundreds of designs did make it into production. Today, millions of these cameras – from KMZ and Lomo, MMZ and FED – still survive in working condition.</p>
<h4><span id="The_major_models"></span><strong>The major models</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>If you’re curious about Soviet cameras, you’ll find the easily available cameras falling into seven main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leica copy rangefinders:</strong> Mostly made by FED in Kharkiv in the Ukraine and under the “Zorki” name from KMZ in Moscow. These cameras use the same <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/39mm_screw_lenses">L39 screw mount</a> that Leica rangefinders did up until the mid-1950s. These cameras were produced, in various forms, until the early 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>Contax-style rangefinders:</strong> The Kiev brand started out copying the Contax II rangefinder produced in Germany before the war, initially with Contax parts taken as war reparations. The “<a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Kiev_rangefinder">Kiev Contax</a>” line of cameras was made until the late 1980s</li>
<li><strong>Zenit SLRs:</strong> KMZ produced the Soviet Union’s widest array of SLR cameras under the Zenit name. The earliest versions were little more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorki_1">Zorki rangefinder</a> with a reflex prism attached, but the line grew more popular in the late 1960s with the Zenit-E, the first Soviet SLR to use the M42-screw mount. M42 Zenits were made until the early 2000s, and a narrower range of cameras from the mid-1980s until the mid-2000s used the Pentax K mount. Lomo, and Kiev also produced SLRs, but these are far less common.</li>
<li><strong>Simple viewfinder cameras:</strong> Both Lomo in St Petersburg and MMZ in Minsk produced very similar families of snapshooters, rectangular viewfinder cameras with a simple shutter and a three-element glass lens. MMZ’s were called <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vilia">Vilia</a> and Lomo’s were known as Smenas. Just two Smenas – the <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2020/03/these-are-the-most-produced-35mm-cameras-of-all-time/">Smena-8 and the 8M</a> – were built to the tune of around 21 million, making them the most-produced 35mm cameras of all time. These cameras are cheap and rudimentary, but their glass lens definitely elevate them out of toy camera territory.</li>
<li><strong>Simple TLRs:</strong> Medium format cameras were not produced in the same breadth and scale as 35mm cameras, but there were still some successful models. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubitel">Lubitel family</a> of cheap 120-format TLRs are the easiest to find. Built out of plastic but with glass Triplet-style lenses, these Lomo-made cameras were produced from the 1940s until after the fall of the Soviet Union.</li>
<li><strong>Medium format SLRs:</strong> The Soviet Union’s equivalent to the <a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2019/04/camera-geekery-pentax-67/">Pentax 67</a> was the <a href="https://vintagecameradigest.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-kiev-6c-a-photographic-artifact-of-the-cold-war/">Kiev-6C</a>, which eventually evolved into the <a href="http://mattsclassiccameras.com/slr/kiev-60/">Kiev-60</a>. These are big, heavy SLR cameras with a rougher finish than their Western counterparts but with a range of very well-regarded lenses.</li>
<li><strong>Hasselblad-style medium-format cameras: </strong>The Kiev factory also produced a series of Hasselblad-style focal plane cameras, the Kiev-80 and <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Kiev_88">88</a> being the best-known of them. The lenses made for the Kiev-6/60 were also produced for some versions of this camera range. They are cheap – especially compared to Hasselblads – but they don’t come with a great reputation for reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were many other brands and minor camera ranges made in the USSR (the plucky Lomo LC-A compact spawned a movement in photography all on its own), but these are the main ones. They are all reasonably easy to find – very easy in the case of Zenit SLRS and FED rangefinders – and there’s no shortage of spare parts or repairers that can coax them back to life should anything be wrong.</p>
<p>Kosmo Foto released the video below last year as a guide for common models to investigate:</p>

<h4><span id="Better_dead_than_Red"></span><strong>Better dead than Red?</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>Make no mistake – many film camera shooters regard Soviet cameras as uniformally awful, junk that should live in a landfill rather than a camera cabinet. Most of these photographers would sooner cut off a limb than handle a clunky Zenit or Zorki.</p>
<p>But the Soviet camera industry had peaks and troughs – periods when construction and quality control were high and times when standards were lax and reliability low. A Soviet rangefinder from the mid-1950s is from a very different system to one produced in the “Year of Stagnation” of the late 1970s.</p>

<p>The bad reputation which Soviet cameras isn’t undeserved,” says Jay Javier, the Filipino photographer and camera collector behind the <a href="https://www.fedka.com/jay/">Fed Zorki Survival Site</a>. “Many were really badly designed or made. As these creatures become more known, thanks to the internet, the bad ones get to be publicly shamed and justly avoided. Many of the generalisations in this respect turn out to be valid.”</p>
<p>Soviet quality control, especially in later years, sometimes left a lot to be desired. Cameras leaving the factory were supposed to be inspected and given a passport signed by a factory foreman ensuring they were working correctly. This The older …</p></div></div>

								<p>
								Welcome back to Fightin’ Words! It’s been a while since we last discussed how the <a href="https://ki.infil.net/w01-bugs.html">most famous fighting game bugs</a> have impacted the community’s favorite games. Today’s topic is a bit more technical, but it’s an equally important factor in how our favorite modern games are played -- we’re going to be doing a <strong>deep dive into netcode</strong>.								
								</p>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->
								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_lecture.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								At its core, netcode is simply a method for two or more computers, each trying to play the same game, to talk to each other over the internet. While local play always ensures that all player inputs arrive and are processed at the same time, <strong>networks are constantly unstable</strong> in ways the game cannot control or predict. Information sent to your opponent may be delayed, arrive out of order, or become lost entirely depending on dozens of factors, including the physical distance to your opponent, if you’re on a WiFi connection, and whether your roommate is watching Netflix.
								</p><p>
								Online play in games is nothing new, but fighting games have their own set of unique challenges. They tend to involve direct connections to other players, unlike many other popular game genres, and <strong>low, consistent latency</strong> is extremely important because muscle memory and reactions are at the core of virtually every fighting game. As a result, two prominent strategies have emerged for playing fighting games online: <strong>delay-based netcode</strong> and <strong>rollback netcode</strong>. 
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_thoughtful.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								There’s been a renewed passion in the fighting game community that <strong>rollback is the best choice</strong>, and fighting game developers who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW61xJNJ9m8">choose to use delay-based netcode</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTUtnclr2hs">preventing the growth of the genre</a>. While people have been passionate about this topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2kAdmUCaI&amp;t=42m34s">for many years</a>, frustrations continue to rise as new, otherwise excellent games repeatedly have bad online experiences.
								</p><p>

								There are relatively few easy-to-follow explanations for what exactly rollback netcode is, how it works, and why it is so good at hiding the effects of bad connections (though <a href="http://mauve.mizuumi.net/2012/07/05/understanding-fighting-game-networking.html">there are some</a>). Because I feel this topic is extremely important for the future health of the fighting game community, I want to help squash some misconceptions about netcode and explain both netcode strategies thoroughly so everyone can be informed as they discuss. If you stick around to the end, I’ll even <strong>interview some industry experts and community leaders</strong> on the topic!
								</p><p>
								Before we dig into the details, though, let’s get one thing straight.
										
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_smiling_3.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
										Both companies and players should care about good netcode because <strong>playing online is no longer the future -- it's the present</strong>. 
								</p><p>
										While most other video game genres have been this way for a decade or longer, fighting game developers seem to be resistant to embracing online play, perhaps because of the genre’s roots in offline settings such as arcades and tournaments. Playing offline is great, and it will always have considerable value in fighting games, but it’s simply a reality that <strong>a large percentage of the player base will never play offline</strong>. For many fighting game fans, playing online <em>is</em> the game, and a bad online experience prevents them from getting better, playing or recommending the game to their friends, and ultimately causes them to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTUtnclr2hs?t=758">simply go do something else</a>.
								</p><p>
										Even if you think you have a good connection, or live in an area of the world with robust internet infrastructure, good netcode is still mandatory. Plus, lost or delayed information happens regularly even on the best networks, and poor netcode can <a href="https://twitter.com/john_takeuchi/status/1162562266027327488">actively hamper matches</a> no matter how smooth the conditions may be. Good netcode also has the benefit of connecting regions across greater distances, effectively uniting the global player base as much as possible.

											</figcaption></figure></div>
										
								</div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_content.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
										What about those who never play online because they much prefer playing offline with their friends? The <strong>healthy ecosystem</strong> that good netcode creates around a game benefits everyone. There will be more active players, more chances to consume content for your favorite game -- from tech videos to spectating online tournaments to expanding the strategy of lesser-used characters -- and more excitement surrounding your game in the FGC. Despite <a href="http://ki.infil.net/">Killer Instinct</a>’s pedigree as an excellent game, there’s no doubt that its superb rollback netcode has played a huge part in the sustained growth of its community.
								</p><p>

										Good netcode matters, period. So let’s talk about it.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this session, we’ll take a look at some of the ways we can determine whether the development efforts we’re undertaking suffer from too much or too little focus on architecture. We’ll examine a number of real-world examples that are intended to inspire either admiration or terror, and try to find some recipes of how we can get more of the former and less of the latter in our own projects.</p>

<h2>Definitions of Architecture</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/cm/">ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://handbookofsoftwarearchitecture.com/">Grady Booch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by <em>cost of change</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stefan Tilkov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the architect considers important enough to merit their attention</p>

<p><em>Different organizations and applications will require different architectures, and those architectures will change over time</em></p>
<h2>Cases:</h2>
<h3>#1 Non-Extensible Extensibility</h3>
<p>Highly customizable multi-tenant e-commerce solution with lots of features, which has to balance between large customers with specific needs and small customers with generic needs</p>
<ul>
<li>If you attempt to design something that satisfies everybody, you will satisfy nobody.</li>
<li>Highly specific is often preferable to generic</li>
</ul>
<h3>#2 Perilously fine-grained</h3>
<p>Large-scale B2B food retailer building a new logistics system, hired &gt;200 developers to build a microservice-based system. Each developer “owned”
a microservice, which was hell to scale. Eventually moved away from ‘EntityService’ pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody wants to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ3wIuvmHeM">Netflix</a> but nobody is</li>
<li>Small is not always beautiful</li>
<li>Refactoring within team boundaries much easier than globally</li>
<li>Ignore organizational parameters at your own risk</li>
</ul>
<h3>#3 Your system WILL be dynamic</h3>
<p>Large-scale insurance system with &gt;100 developers. 2 releases / year with 2-week modeling period  What if you miss this slot?</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized responsibility hurts</li>
<li>Faces with too much rigidity, a way around the rules will be found</li>
<li>Just because you’re used to it doesn’t make it acceptable</li>
</ul>
<h3>#4 Free-style Architecture</h3>
<p>A small E-Commerce / Online shop which grew fast to 100-120 developers over ~10 self-contained teams</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid increasing the numbers of developers if you can</li>
<li>Move to system of systems</li>
<li>If you don’t actively create an architecture, be prepared to deal with the one that emerges.</li>
<li>Loose coupling requires very few rules, but they need to be enforced strictly</li>
</ul>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3>#5 Cancerous Growth</h3>
<p>Financial services provider with independent brokers as clients, 20 years of company history. Spun off new company and just copied system and then <em>shared the database</em>. Also implemented own encryption in Borland C++ and noticed bug after encryption own database</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful systems often end up with the worst architecture</li>
<li>Unmanaged evolution will lead to complete chaos</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid of some light architectural governance</li>
</ul>
<h3>#6 Improve with less intelligence</h3>
<p>Bank with multiple CotS systems, phased out proprietary solution to replace with OSS. Replaced “Magical Integration Broker” with much more simple dockerized pubsub solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Smart endpoints, dumb pipes</a> AKA never put too much logic or intelligence into infrastructure</li>
<li>Valuespecific over generic solutions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don’t be afraid of architecture</li>
<li>Choose the simplest thing that will work</li>
<li>Create evolvable structures</li>
<li>Manage your system’s architectural evolution</li>
<li>Don’t create road blocks - create value and get out of the way</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p>Consistently ranked as one of the leading causes of death around the world, malaria doesnâ€™t have an effective vaccine yet. But researchers have invented a promising new blueprint for one â€” with properties akin to the novel RNA-based vaccine for COVID-19.</p><p>Making a vaccine for malaria is challenging because its associated parasite, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Plasmodium-protozoan-genus"><em>Plasmodium</em></a><em>,</em> contains a protein that inhibits production of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/memory-t-cell">memory T-cells</a>, which protect against previously encountered pathogens. If the body canâ€™t generate these cells, a vaccine is ineffective. But scientists recently tried a new approach using an RNA-based platform.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Their design circumvented the sneaky protein, allowed the body to produce the needed T-cells and completely immunized against malaria. The patent application for their novel vaccine, which hasn't yet been tested on humans, was <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20210030859.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20210030859&amp;RS=DN/20210030859">published</a> by the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office on Feb. 4.</p><p>â€œIt's probably the highest level of protection that has been seen in a mouse model,â€� said Richard Bucala, co-inventor of the new vaccine and a physician and professor at Yale School of Medicine.</p><p>The teamâ€™s breakthrough could save hundreds of thousands of lives, particularly in developing nations. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria">In 2019 alone</a>, there were an estimated 229 million cases of malaria and 409,000 deaths worldwide. Of those deaths, 94% were in Africa, with children being the most vulnerable.</p><p>â€œIt affects societies and populations that have the least amount of resources and expertise to manage these infections well," Bucala told <em>The Academic Times</em>. "We need new vaccines, and we need more tools."</p><p>Novartis Pharmaceuticals and the National Institutes of Health funded the work. GlaxoSmithKline is an assignee on the patent, which if approved, will allow the company to produce the vaccine and make it available to the public.</p><p>At present, the only vaccine to prevent malaria is called <a href="https://www.malariavaccine.org/sites/www.malariavaccine.org/files/content/page/files/PATH_MVI_RTSS_Fact%20sheet_042019.pdf">RTS,S</a>. Approved two years ago, this vaccine is the result of nearly two decades of research, but is only about 30% effective. And after four years, that figure drops to 15%.</p><p>â€œIt doesn't work very well,â€� Bucala said. â€œAnd the research studies all have the conclusion that the people who fail to mount a vaccine response, or who get reinfected, have poor memory T-cell responses.â€�</p><p>Along with Andrew Geall, a pharmaceutical researcher who developed the RNA platform that the duo used, Bucala found a way to prevent the unwanted protein in <em>Plasmodium</em>, called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17158894/">PMIF</a>, from inhibiting T-cell generation.Â&nbsp;</p><p>â€œOur research studies indicate that it was this particular gene product, PMIF, that was responsible for this,â€� Bucala said. â€œIt prevented memory T-cells from forming, and that's why one could not generate a memory response to <em>Plasmodium</em>.â€�</p><p>In a conventional vaccine, for instance the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm">standard flu vaccine</a>, an inactivated version of the virus is injected into a host. The body recognizes an intruder, fights against it, generates antibodies against the harmless virus, then returns back to normal.Â&nbsp;</p><p>However, once the virus has left the host, the body needs a way to remember how it fought back. Otherwise it will have to relearn the antibody generation â€” but perhaps next time with the actual, harmful virus infecting the host all the while. This is where memory T-cells come in: They remember how to generate the immune response and remind the body when the time comes. <em>PlasmodiumÂ&nbsp;</em>prevents the immune memory system from occurring by producing PMIF.</p><p>â€œSuppressing the T-cell response and immune memory is so important to the parasite that the parasite brings its own gene, PMIF, to do that,â€� Bucala said. â€œIf you eliminate that factor, the body naturally develops memory immunity.â€�</p><p>The concept of the novel malaria vaccine accounts for the PMIF problem. Instead of injecting the actual pathogen, the vaccine presents the body with instructions, via RNA, on how to create the protein unique to the pathogen by itself in order to fight it â€” which is precisely how Pfizerâ€™s COVID-19 vaccine works.</p><p>However, rather than an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">mRNA platform</a>, Bucala and Geall use a self-amplifying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474593/">saRNA</a> platform. The key benefit of the latter is that it is effective at much lower doses because it can rapidly produce copies of itself inside the cell.Â&nbsp;</p><p>â€œFor saRNA, one can potentially make a million doses of vaccine with a couple liters of synthetic production,â€� Bucala said. â€œIt's much more efficient than the base-protected mRNA vaccines.â€�</p><p>The proposed saRNA vaccine tells the body to create the troublesome PMIF protein, generates antibodies against it and naturally produces the necessary memory T-cells, as Bucala had hoped.</p><p>â€œWe thought we could combine RTS,S with a PMIF vaccine, but the mouse studies seem to suggest that just immunizing with PMIF is sufficient,â€� Bucala highlighted.Â&nbsp;â€œThat's how striking the results were.â€�</p><p>Bucala and Geall have placed their vaccine in the hands of the Oxford University institution that facilitated the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55302595">AstraZeneca</a> COVID-19 vaccine. It is one of the only places in the world that is doing phase 1 studies in malaria, meaning researchers infect human volunteers with the disease after immunizing them.</p><p>â€œThis is not in humans yet," Bucala noted, â€œbut they are the group that can put it into humans, I think, best. We are doing those studies this year."</p><p>Beyond the saRNA technology's use for the malaria vaccine, Bucala believes it is an ideal method for immunization design in the future, including for COVID-19 prevention, because of its dual low cost and high yield. He says it could reach far and wide.Â&nbsp;</p><p>â€œThe current mRNA approach is an important step in that direction,â€� he said. â€œBut we are going to, I believe, need to do better. I hope that the saRNA opens that platform.â€�</p><p><em>The application for the patent, Uses Of Parasite Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factors, was filed on Oct. 16, 2020 to the U.S. Patent Trademark Office with the application number 17/073006. The inventors of the pending patent are Richard Bucala, Yale School of Medicine and Andrew Geall, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. The assignees are Yale University and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.</em></p><p><em>Parola Analytics provided technical research for this story.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

            <strong>Jun 12, 2020</strong> &nbsp; (Updated Mar 1, 2021)
            
            </p>

            <p>The Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator (MBTI) gets a lot of scorn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 2 million people take it annually, at the behest of corporate HR departments, colleges, and even government agencies. The company that produces and markets the test makes around $20 million off it each year.</p>

  <p>The only problem? The test is completely meaningless.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless">Why the Myers-Briggs test is totally meaningless (Vox)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I began to read through the evidence, and I found that the MBTI is about as useful as a polygraph for detecting lies. One researcher even called it an “act of irresponsible armchair philosophy.” When it comes to accuracy, if you put a horoscope on one end and a heart monitor on the other, the MBTI falls about halfway in between.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-take/201309/goodbye-mbti-the-fad-won-t-die">Goodbye to MBTI, the Fad That Won’t Die (Psychology Today)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some psychologists believe that independent, peer-reviewed research in the decades since the MBTI was devised has provided something better than Myers-Briggs. They champion the notion of the “Big Five” personality traits — openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8790ef0a-d040-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377">Is Myers-Briggs up to the job? (Financial Times)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the MBTI gives a ridiculously limited and simplified view of human personality, which is a very complex and tricky concept to pin down and study. The scientific study of personality is indeed a valid discipline, and there are many personality tests that seemingly hold up to scientific scrutiny (thus far). It just appears that MBTI isn’t one of them.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific">Nothing personal: The questionable Myers-Briggs test (The Guardian)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that the the MBTI is nonsense, but the Big Five is a <em>real, scientifically valid</em> test. To be sure, there’s nothing wrong with the Big Five. But these haughty claims that it’s dramatically better than the MBTI have got to end.</p>

<h2 id="claims-against-the-mbti">Claims Against the MBTI</h2>

<p><strong>MYERS AND BRIGGS JUST, LIKE, MADE IT UP</strong></p>

<p>It’s true. Myers and Briggs were enthusiasts of Carl Jung’s theories who created the test during WWII. They hoped to aid the entry of women into the workforce. They weren’t professional scientists and didn’t base it on some large corpus of data. And Jung’s theories are… controversial today.</p>

<p><strong>THERE AREN’T 16 DISCRETE TYPES OF PEOPLE</strong></p>

<p>Also true!  There is no switch in your brain set to T or F. We will probably never find the “judging” gene. These traits <em>are</em> probably heritable — <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739500/">everything is</a> — but polygenic. So we should expect varying strengths even if we disregard “nurture” influences.</p>

<p>This complaint is understandable. Some early MBTI proponents really did defend binary outcomes, claiming each attribute was “theoretically dichotomous”. There was even some now-debunked research that claimed to prove that empirically. It’s now clear that the population has a standard bell-shaped distribution for each trait. For example, this is a histogram of the E-I axis (other axes look similar):</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/mbti/hist-ei.png" alt="histogram of extroversion / introversion scores" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>This is from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327752jpa7801_11">Bimodal Score Distributions and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator: Fact or Artifact?</a> (Answer: Artifact)</p>

<p><strong>THE MBTI HAS POOR REPEATABILITY</strong></p>

<p>Technically true. Suppose someone takes the test, then repeats it 4-5 weeks later. Something like 35-50% of people will fall into a different one of the 16 groups. Is that bad? We’ll come back to this.</p>

<p><strong>THE MBTI DOESN’T VARY BETWEEN PEOPLE</strong></p>

<p>Not true. This is claimed <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless">strangely often</a> with no evidence. Remember that histogram above for introversion vs. extroversion? There’s plenty of variability. All the other axes are similar. Since no one really provides any evidence for this claim, there’s not much to rebut here.</p>

<p>If we’re being <em>very</em> generous, perhaps we could interpret this as a complaint that the population mean for each trait is around zero. That’s true, but again, it varies <em>plenty</em>.</p>

<p><strong>THE MBTI MAKES EVERYONE SEEM LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE</strong></p>

<p>I think this is true. It’s hard to read the Big Five and conclude that neuroticism is a positive thing. But every MBTI type seems wonderful in its own way.</p>

<p><strong>THE MBTI MEASURES THINGS THAT AREN’T FUNDAMENTAL or THE MBTI ISN’T USED BY REAL SCIENTISTS or MY IN-GROUP SAYS I MUST TREAT IT WITH CONTEMPT</strong></p>

<p>Well, maybe.</p>

<p>The Myers-Briggs foundation <a href="https://mbtitraininginstitute.myersbriggs.org/what-you-will-learn/the-mbti-assessment/">grasps at an image of scientific seriousness</a> in a way that’s a little ridiculous. It grates on me, and I’m not a psychologist. People should probably stop spending money on the official test. People should <em>definitely</em> stop paying <a href="https://mbtitraininginstitute.myersbriggs.org/mbti-training/schedule/">$2,500</a> to get certified to administer that test.</p>

<h2 id="in-defense-of-the-mbti">In defense of the MBTI</h2>

<p><strong>YOU DON’T HAVE TO BINARIZE THE AXES</strong></p>

<p>90% of the complaints about MBTI come down to: <em>you can’t split people into two groups along these axes</em>! Yeah, OK, then how about we don’t do that?</p>

<p>Of course someone can be borderline. <em>Most</em> people are borderline along at least one axis.  Early versions of the MBTI actually gave an “x” for someone near the middle. Let’s bring this back! In fact, let’s go further.</p>

<p>Behold: <strong>Dynomight™ MBTI notation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong preference: Capital letter</li>
  <li>Weak preference: Lower-case letter</li>
  <li>Borderline: x</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: eNxJ is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>weakly extroverted (e)</li>
  <li>strongly intuitive (N)</li>
  <li>borderline thinking / feeling (x)</li>
  <li>strongly judging (J)</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives five bins for each axis. You can still sort of say it out loud by making the strong preferences louder. This gives 5⁴=625 possible results. Of course, there aren’t 625 discrete types of people either. Our goal isn’t to split people into groups, it’s to give a convenient summary of how they answered a bunch of questions.</p>

<p>To underline this point, I even created a <a href="https://dynomight.net/mbti">Myers-Briggs quiz you can take in 2 minutes</a> that gives results in this form.</p>

<p>To claim it’s never useful to discretize denies human nature. You might as well claim we shouldn’t say “hot” or “cold” but must always give a number of degrees.</p>

<p><strong>IF YOU DON’T LIKE BINARIZATION THEN DON’T</strong></p>

<p>If you’d like a test that gives the scores as continuous attributes, may I recommend… any test? For example, here’s the results of me randomly clicking answers on two popular websites:</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/mbti/test3-psychcentral.png" alt="third test" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/mbti/test2-16personalities.png" alt="second test" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Not convinced? You can even check the “official” results that gullible people pay money for. They look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/mbti/test1-official.png" alt="first test" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p><strong>THE MBTI MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED THE “BIG FOUR”</strong></p>

<p>And what happens if you don’t discretize the axes? If you take continuous measurements (like <em>every Myers-Briggs test ever</em> gives you) they correlate strongly with four of the five big five measurements.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/mbti/correlations.jpg" alt="correlations between MBTI and big five" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The rows show the four MBTI axes, while the columns show the Big Five axes. This shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The MBTI E-I axis is strongly correlated with the Big Five extraversion axis. (duh)</li>
  <li>The MBTI S-N axis is strongly correlated with the Big Five openness axis.</li>
  <li>The MBTI T-F axis is moderately correlated with the Big Five agreeableness axis and weakly correlated with the conscientiousness axis.</li>
  <li>The MBTI J-P axis is moderately correlated with the conscientiousness axis and weakly correlated with the openness axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>To interpret these numbers, note that 74/69 is what you get when the axis is <em>exactly the same thing with exactly the same name</em>. These correlations are strong.</p>

<p>But don’t blame all the journalists for not knowing about this. After all this groundbreaking research is hot off the presses having only been published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1989.tb00759.x">1989</a>. Other research supports the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(96)00033-5">same basic conclusion</a>.</p>

<p>What does this mean? If you believe the MBTI is meaningless, fine. But you must also therefore believe the Big Five is meaningless!</p>

<p><strong>THE MBTI’S REPEATABILITY IS FINE</strong></p>

<p>If someone is near the middle, a small change can land them on the other side. This is why 35-50% of people fall into a different one of the 16 buckets when they re-test. The most common score for all axes is near the middle. There are 4 different axes. If some small measurement noise puts you over the middle on <em>any</em> axis, then you fall into a different bucket.</p>

<p>Since <em>we</em> aren’t binarizing the axes, this is not something to worry about. Instead, we should just ask: How repeatable are the continuous measurements? For reference, here’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha">Cronbach’s alpha</a> for the Big Five, measured for an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.01.500">Arabic version</a>. Higher numbers indicate better repeatability.</p>

<p><strong>YOU CAN ADD AN AXIS IF YOU WANT</strong></p>

<p>The Big Five measures neuroticism, while the MBTI does not. This is, no doubt, a very important trait. Some MBTI variants add extra axes. For example, one can introduce an axis that measures <em>turbulence</em> vs. <em>assertiveness</em>. This is a measure of neuroticism in all but name.</p>

<h2 id="why-go-with-the-mbti">Why go with the MBTI?</h2>

<p>Everything above just says the MBTI isn’t much worse than the Big Five. So why not just use the Big Five? Well, you just try it.</p>

<p><strong>THE MBTI IS COMFORTABLE TO TALK ABOUT</strong></p>

<p>Say you’re on a first date. You discuss your favorite Italian films, the pets you had growing up. Then, you ask <em>How agreeable are you?</em> How does that go?</p>

<p>If that seems cherry-picked, let’s go through all the attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How extroverted are you?</em> This is fine.</li>
  <li><em>How neurotic are you?</em> Uncomfortable.</li>
  <li><em>How agreeable are you?</em> Uncomfortable.</li>
  <li><em>How conscientious are you?</em> Somewhat uncomfortable.</li>
  <li><em>How open are you to experience?</em> This <em>seems</em> fine, but isn’t.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only one of the five is OK. And — as you surely noticed— that same attribute exists in the MBTI.</p>

<p>Can I tell you a secret? The MBTI’s names for the S-I axes are <em>sensing</em> and <em>intuition</em>. These don’t make any sense. The Big Five <em>openness to experience</em> is much more descriptive. And yet, I claim, the MBTI names are often better <em>because</em> they are meaningless. Everyone claims to be open! But since no one has any idea what “sensing” is, they’ll happily admit to it. Deliberate or accidental, this subterfuge is extremely useful.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, the MBTI’s omission of neuroticism is sometimes good. The alternative to four axes is often zero, not five.</p>

<p>The advantage of the the MBTI is precisely that it <em>makes …</em></p></div></div></div></div>

<p>I had a fun time giving a Z3 tutorial at Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer (FMIE) <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/">https://fmie2021.github.io/</a> (videos coming soon hopefully!). I got to be kind of the "fun dad" with the Z3 tutorial <a href="https://github.com/philzook58/z3_tutorial">https://github.com/philzook58/z3_tutorial</a> , while at times it felt a bit like Cody's Coq tutorial <a href="https://github.com/codyroux/broad-coq-tutorial">https://github.com/codyroux/broad-coq-tutorial</a> was trying to feed the kids their vegetables. It was a fantastic tutorial (maybe the best I've seen?), but it was tough love. He knew it was going to be like this from the outset and had a fun little analogy of me downhill skiing while he was about to go on an uphill mountaineering slog.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors to lead to this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I could use Z3’s python bindings giving an air of familiarity, whereas everything was incredibly foreign in Coq.</li>
  <li>Z3 can actually be used to declaratively state problems and pushbutton calculate solutions to them with very little user help, which gives it a lot more "Wow" factor.</li>
  <li>Coq is a tool that requires significantly more background to even comprehend what the hell it is. I still think many aspects of it are totally bizarre. But Coq users, this is just the water they swim in. For example, defining an inductive predicate as a datatype is still a bizarre notion to me, but it is Coq 101. I say this to Coq users and they look at me like I’m nuts. “What could even be the problem?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, a fun exercise for me was to take the examples from my tutorial and try to translate them into Coq. For the most part I think it isn't that hard and rather educational.</p>
<p>It's interesting the things that show up. Because the Z3 tutorial was designed for automation, the more automated tactics in MicroOmega and Ring are super useful. </p>
<p><a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html">https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html</a></p>
<p>
The thing is that the sort of proofs that show up here are fine and all, but they aren't going to teach you to fish for yourself. When you step out of this super automatable fragment you're sunk if you don't know other techniques, like the ones Cody was teaching. There may be a better balance of fun and education to be found.</p>
<p>I think there is a hole in the educational content out there on Coq. Software Foundations focuses on the rudiments, CPDT and FRAP kind of takes it a little hardcore, and the Mathematical Components stuff makes you buy in on ssreflect style and some hardcore math topics, both of which are nuts I have not cracked. Also, all of them are really long and initimidating. Seems like there should be something a little more breezy, a little more automatic. It is demoralizing as a beginner to either not know how to prove obvious trivial facts, or even to struggle to do so at great length.</p>
<p>This was also a nice opportunity to take Alectryon by Clément Pit-Claudel out for a spin <a href="https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon">https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon</a> Alectryon allows you to see the proof state on hover over in your browser. It's a super important part of the Coq. It was pretty easy to put in my blog. Just copy and paste the gnarly html output into a Jekyll post and make sure to link in the CSS files in an assets folder, because they are where the magic happens.</p>
<p>The gist for this post is here <a href="https://gist.github.com/philzook58/acd204b4895c41f9e85618f0f6b30a58">https://gist.github.com/philzook58/acd204b4895c41f9e85618f0f6b30a58</a></p>

<span>*)</span></span></span></pre><p>which Z3 returns the solution [y = 0, x = 7].</p>
<p>It isn't so obvious how to get coq to find this solution in a low effort way. However, it is easy to get Coq to confirm the validity of this solution given that you know about the [lia] tactic. Otherwise it may be kind of annoying. In general, it may be a good approach to use external tools to produce solutions and just manually place the solutions into Coq. Validating a solution is often easier than producing it.</p>

<p>The goal of this article is to explore the topic of the camera response function experimentally. We’ll build
up from first principles and the main focus will be on building intuition with code examples. The only pre-requisite is base
familiarity with Python + NumPy and, of course, curiosity about the topic. 🧑‍🚀</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a quick way to find out the response function of your camera, you can check out the
implementation of <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d27/classcv_1_1CalibrateDebevec.html">CalibrateDebevec</a> in OpenCV, or stick around to get a deeper intuition.</p>
<p>I’ve made an effort to link to interesting resources that provide a good starting point to dig deeper into specific directions
that could not be covered in this article. You’re encouraged to follow them and come back to this at your own pace.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>You can follow along and play with the code examples. The Jupyter notebook is <a href="https://github.com/martomi/roboalgorithms-code/blob/main/notebooks/camera-response-function.ipynb">available on
Github</a>. 📔</p>

<h2 id="what-the-crf-">What the CRF? 🤔</h2>
<p>A camera measures the light intensity hitting the imaging sensor and outputs an image with pixel values that in some way
correspond to that light intensity. This correspondence is modeled by the camera response function (CRF).</p>
<p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/crf-animation.gif#center" alt="Camera Response Function Animation"></p>
<p>For a computer vision engineer, the pixel values are the only observation of the real-world. Thus, it is helpful to understand
how they relate to actual light intensities to correctly model that world.</p>
<p>Most cameras have some non-linearity in their response to light intensities. Images taken by consumer-grade cameras are particularly
affected by this because they are optimized for viewing experience and not for measurement accuracy.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>If we know the response function, we can resolve that ambiguity and turn any camera
into a scientific measurement device! 🔬</p>
</div>

<h2 id="applications-of-the-crf-">Applications of the CRF 🔨</h2>
<p>Many computer vision algorithms that rely on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16385/s17/Slides/14.1_Brightness_Constancy.pdf">brightness constancy
assumption</a> require accurate estimation of the
CRF. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow">optical flow</a> or any direct method for visual SLAM that
works with pixel intensities such as <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/research/vslam/dso">DSO</a>.</p>
<p>Direct methods for visual SLAM are currently one of the most robust approaches for accurate robot localization in
challenging environments where GNSS coverage is unreliable. An autonomous last-mile robot delivery service is an example that’s
increasingly gaining <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-fedex-delivery-robots-your-sidewalk/">commercial traction</a> in recent years
and may use such technology.</p>
<p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/delivery-robot.png#center" alt="Delivery Robot"></p>
<div>
  <p>💡</p>
  <p>One could argue that due to the shift towards deep learning approaches and more readily available cameras that are optimized
for machine vision, it will be unnecessary to manually calibrate for the camera response function in the future. Nevertheless, I still
see value in exploring the fundamentals for learning purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>In this article, we’ll look at the application of generating <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/debevec-malik97.pdf">HDR images</a> which
also relies on knowledge about the camera response function because we need to “fuse” multiple images taken at different exposure times.</p>

<p>A camera is an array of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode">photodiodes</a> that converts incoming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photons</a> into electrical current or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a>. This phenomenon is known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">photoelectric effect</a> and is the
same phenomenon utilized in solar panels.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>We measure the voltage to determine the amount of incident light.</p>
</div>

<p>For each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-pixel_sensor#Pixel">pixel</a>, there’s a corresponding photodiode in the
camera sensor. We take an image by exposing the sensor to light for a given period (exposure time). Since the
photodiodes produce an electrical current proportional to the amount of light they receive, we can use that measurement to
reconstruct the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/photodiode-to-image.png#center" alt="Photodiode to Image"></p>
<h2 id="converting-voltages-to-pixel-values--">Converting voltages to pixel values  📺</h2>
<p>When we measure the voltage generated by the photodiode we get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal">analog</a>
quantity. But we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal">digital</a> value that fits into our pixel
representation of 8 bits. A device that can perform this conversion is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">Analog-Digital (A/D)
converter</a>. Most A/D converters used in cameras today will output
an 8, 12, or 16-bit digital value.</p>
<h3 id="analog-to-digital-converter-">Analog-to-Digital Converter 📈</h3>
<p>We will start with an 8-bit A/D converter. Note that regardless of the bit depth, the range of possible values will be limited in
the digital domain. Meaning that with 8-bit we only have <span>
  \(2^{8} = 256\)
</span>
, unique values to assign to all possible voltage
measurements.</p>
<p>Let’s simulate a naive A/D converter:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>max_value</span>(bit_depth: int) <span>-&gt;</span> int:

<h4 id="quantization-noise">Quantization noise</h4>
<p>From the staircase-like plot above we can see the discrete jumps caused by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)">quantization</a> effects. Because we’re losing some precision at this step, this effect also becomes a component of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise">total image noise</a> known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise#Quantization_noise_(uniform_noise)">quantization noise</a>.</p>
<h4 id="under--and-overexposure">Under- and overexposure</h4>
<p>The plot also demonstrates that any values below or above the supported range are irreversibly lost. This phenomenon is known as under- or overexposure.
Our goal will always be to choose the exposure time such that this effect is minimized.</p>
<h4 id="dynamic-range">Dynamic Range</h4>
<p>The range of light intensities that the camera can capture without under- or overexposure is called the camera dynamic range. It is a very important
metric for outdoor robot operation due to the large variations in light intensities.</p>
<div>
  <p>💡</p>
  <p>Curiously, extending the dynamic range of the camera isn’t as simple as increasing the bit-depth of the A/D converter. The primary limiting factor is usually linked to the physical <a href="https://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/dynamicrange.html">full-well capacity and noise level</a> of the photodiodes. The bit-depth of the A/D converter is then selected to maximize that.</p>
</div>

<p>So our goal is to maximize the information we can get from every image. We have two ways to optimize for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a camera with a higher dynamic range</li>
<li>Adjust the exposure time to minimize over- and underexposure</li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>For very dimly lit scenarios, it is not always an option to adjust the exposure time because a very long exposure time can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur">motion blur</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="programmable-gain-amplifier-">Programmable Gain Amplifier ⬛</h3>
<p>Underexposure happens for dimly lit scenes or shorter exposure times when the photodiodes don’t have a chance to convert a sufficient amount of photons into electrical current. This is how a fully underexposed image looks:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py">photodiode_array_milivolts <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array([<span>0.028</span>, <span>0.213</span>, <span>0.234</span>, <span>0.459</span>])

</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://roboalgorithms.com/crf/underexposed-image.png#center" alt="Underexposed Image"></p>
<p>Cameras have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable-gain_amplifier">programmable-gain amplifier</a> (PGA) that can amplify the voltages from the photodiodes and bring them in the range supported by the A/D converter. The level of amplification can be configured on most cameras through the ISO setting.</p>
<div>
  <p>👉</p>
  <p>We can capture images in the dark without increasing the exposure time as much.</p>
</div>

<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span>def</span> <span>pga</span>(milivolts: np<span>.</span>ndarray, gain: float <span>=</span> <span>1.0</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> float:

<p>There’s a caveat: we did not model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise">image noise</a>. The weaker signal in dimply lit scenes results in a lower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</a>. In other words, amplifying the signal will also amplify the noise and that’s why using a higher gain usually results in grainier and lower quality images. In extreme cases when the strength of the signal is below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_floor">noise floor</a> it can be difficult to extract <em>any</em> useful information.</p>

<h2 id="further-recommended-reading-">Further Recommended Reading 📚</h2>
<p>I’m aware that I’ve touched upon a lot of topics very quickly. If you don’t have a good intuition already, I highly recommend reading
this amazing interactive introduction on <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/">Cameras and Lenses</a>. Seriously, please go check this article out.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/MytCfECfqWc">The Science of Camera Sensors</a> is another great resource in video form that provides an excellent introduction to the physics of how photodiodes and camera sensors work.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>: For a more in-depth look into the theory and physics behind CMOS photodiodes, chapter 3 from <a href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01062484/document">this dissertation</a> provides a good overview.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer-ℹ">Disclaimer ℹ️</h2>
<p>For the sake of brevity, many of the physical aspects of cameras are oversimplified in the presented examples. They are only meant to aid the intuition and shouldn’t be relied upon for accuracy or completeness. However, if you spot any mistakes, I would love to hear about them at 📨

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Furries are notorious. Among purveyors of cringe, saying, "Furries, amirite?" is like Jerry Seinfeld mentioning air travel. Furries aren't the punchline, they're a whole category of joke! Nature is red in tooth and claw, never more so than when jaded internet denizens recollect that Tony the Tiger is, to some, a hottie.</p><p>(No, seriously. Legend has it that the official Tony the Twitter account had to be shut down because furries kept offering, uh, uncomfortably positive brand feedback. Apparently the NPS boost wasn't worth it.)</p><p>Okay but like, what <em>are</em> furries, who counts? Fear not —&nbsp;in these modern times, a venerable brand such as Merriam-Webster considers itself savvy enough to compete with the likes of Urban Dictionary and Know Your Meme. And, tbh, did a decent job <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/history-of-furry-and-fursona">covering the basics</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A rising usage of <em>furry</em> refers to people who have a keen interest in, or even dress up as, anthropomorphic animal characters, like those often seen in comics, games, and cartoons. The personalized animal identity of a furry is known as their <em>fursona</em>, the portmanteau of <em>furry</em> and <em>persona</em>. <em>Fursonas</em> can exist as costumes, online avatars, or even full lifestyles.</p></blockquote><p>Essentially, furry is all about playing pretend. Newsflash, it's fun to be silly and make up stories! A wolf with amethyst eyes <em>would</em> be awesome, that's why they keep putting them on those sick shirts.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with furries, you might think the hobby sounds harmless, if perhaps a bit childish, and you'd be right. But you'd also be underestimating how ridiculously — how <em>effervescently</em>, and sometimes tumescently — over-the-top furries can be. Furries go hard for what we enjoy. By my way of thinking, the unabashed passion in face of constant ridicule is exemplary.</p><p>Because yeah, if you're not a kid and you roleplay as a fantasy animal version of yourself, people will make fun of you. FYI.</p><p>My headline asks, are furries freaks? Contra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge</a>, the answer is yes (and I'll get into why, don't you worry). Oddballs have a way of rolling into corners together. When it comes to furries, our insistence on aberrance has made us infamous, at least if you're sufficiently immersed in certain ecosystems of digital degeneracy.</p><p>Let's back up for a second. Allow me to introduce myself — nice to meet you, I'm a cartoon rabbit. Bunsonya looks like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c478d9-8466-4dc8-8868-eb8d8bb0bd1f_800x1173.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c478d9-8466-4dc8-8868-eb8d8bb0bd1f_800x1173.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56c478d9-8466-4dc8-8868-eb8d8bb0bd1f_800x1173.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1173,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:107061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>(Portrait by <a href="https://twitter.com/PastellBits">@PastellBits</a>.)</p><p>Mike asked me to explain what the heck is going on with furries after he was swarmed by communists with critter avatars. I've forgotten how he evoked such revilement, but presumably it comes with the territory when you're a Very Online™ billionaire. Surely Elon Musk has attracted his share of furry ire! Among other quirks, furries lean <em>heavily </em>left politically.</p><p>Before we get into that, I know what you're wondering: Is it a sex thing? That's always the first question. Furry <em>can</em> be a sex thing —&nbsp;is often a sex thing, I admit —&nbsp;but it doesn't strictly have to be. One's fursona can be a more involved version of one's <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Patronus_Charm">Patronus</a>, or what people indifferent to ~le cultural appropriation~ <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1314752483722313728">might call a spirit animal</a>.</p><p>Most fursonas are toonishly anthropomorphic, as demonstrated by Bunsonya above, but again that's not essential. The basic idea is that you have an animal alter-ego and socially abnormal enthusiasm for it.</p><p>As my Twitter mutual @Jebriel <a href="https://twitter.com/Jebriel/status/1360343188385501187">put it</a>, "I think this is just a lowkey form of dysphoria with extra steps." Not coincidentally, the furry community is chock-full of transgender and autistic people — two demographics that already form a Venn diagram. Homo- and bisexuality are also notably prevalent.</p><p>No one will judge you for keeping horny off main, especially given that furries want to welcome under-18 anthro enthusiasts as well as the adults. Neither are adherents required to wear a fursuit, which is what those team-mascot-looking costumes are called.</p><p>In fact, fursuits are expensive, routinely running thousands of dollars, and either out of reach or undesirable to many in the fandom. Those outfits are just as sweaty and itchy as you'd guess from looking at them, and fursuiters tend to wear a layer of Under Armour HeatGear (or similar) to protect both suit and skin.</p><p>The appeal is an altered mode of self-expression, both aesthetic and interpersonal. @Aryeh___ <a href="https://twitter.com/Aryeh___/status/1360699795266961410">pointed out</a> that fursuiting is "a helpful way for people who struggle in social situations (ASD spectrum, etc) to be boisterous, cuddly, and animalistic in the safety of a covering/mask."</p><p>Regarding "the fandom" — this is what the furry community tends to call itself, despite not being devoted to a specific media property. As you might guess, any halfway decent depiction of anthropomorphized critters is likely to be a hit with furries (the anime <em>Beastars</em> is a recent fave). And the community is teeming with original artists devoted to this subject. Yes, a great deal of it is porn.</p><p>To be abundantly clear, no one can deny that furries writ large are a lascivious bunch prone to unusual fetishes (though, as I mentioned above, valiant if ultimately quixotic attempts are made to shield the minority of kids and teenagers). Why is there a notable crossover between furry and inflation, or furry and oviposition? Because furries are perverts, duh. Our reputation nearly always precedes us.</p><p>However, furries are not <em>morally</em> depraved except by puritan busybody standards. Having sex while pretending that you are an animal is a different ball of wax from sexually assaulting an actual animal. One is fantasy play; one is a repugnant crime.</p><p>Zoosadists (people who aspire toward the latter) infiltrate the community for obvious reasons —&nbsp;furry porn can be a tittilating "second best" for those into irl bestiality. But whenever a zoosadist's proclivities are discovered, they are promptly called out, shunned, and reported to the relevant authorities to whatever extent possible.</p><p>So, anyway, about the communism. There's no slam-dunk, smoking-gun reason why furries are rabidly leftist, though demographics are a likely cause. An <a href="https://dogpatch.press/2018/07/17/furry-socialism/">article</a> on prominent furry news site Dogpatch Press chalks it up to the fandom's communitarian and DIY ethos, making sure to note: "If you're conservative, libertarian, or other, contributing good content outlasts natural disagreement among sub-fandom groups. It takes special effort to earn unwelcome."</p><p>To translate, if you're the kind of conservative or libertarian who doesn't push progressives' buttons and is generally on the quiet side about politics, you'll be fine. That said, not everyone gives a fuck about this; some furries are of the old-school hacker ethos in which your terrible ideology, whatever it may be, is irrelevant.</p><p>The article chastises alt-right furries — which, yes, are a thing — that George Orwell, indubitably, would say "Nazi Furs Fuck Off." Contemporary over-application of the term "Nazi" plays into this to some degree, but incredibly there are indeed Neo-Nazi furries, or at least people who lean into that LARP. However, at a furry con you are far more likely to encounter hammer-and-sickle insignias, to the extent that you could put it on a bingo card.</p><p>A key thing to understand is that furries constitute a fringe outcast community, mocked and ostracized by default. All groups of this sort are characterized by what I call "outlierness," a polite euphemism for being seriously strange. And traits cluster —&nbsp;for example, the gayness, transness, and autisticness of furries make it no surprise that many furries work in the tech industry. Those clustered traits become self-reinforcing stereotypes, forming cultural positive feedback loops.</p><p>If furries are startlingly often on the commie spectrum or somewhere near it, where does all the money for fursuits and porn come from? Dude, jobs. Again a comparison to the tech industry is apt —&nbsp;I'm sure you can think of a programmer pulling several $100k in salary alone who nonetheless cheers on the DSA, and I bet that a few have alts stanning for Mao on the low.</p><p>Not that most furries are rich; the wealthy among us happen to "take one for the team" in terms of funding the community's creative endeavors, and thus are more visible. They're also the people who can afford fursuits, assumed by uninformed normies to represent the entire fandom.</p><p>Hopefully you now have a passable understanding of What the Deal Is with Furries. Perhaps you're intrigued —&nbsp;if you'd like a fursona of your own, check out <a href="https://thisfursonadoesnotexist.com/">This Fursona Does Not Exist</a> and see what catches your fancy!</p><p>-Sonya Mann </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0066d83-7bdd-4746-ab56-7f0fcfcffef2_2746x1156.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0066d83-7bdd-4746-ab56-7f0fcfcffef2_2746x1156.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e0066d83-7bdd-4746-ab56-7f0fcfcffef2_2746x1156.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:613,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3960700,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://writer.math.dev/">https://writer.math.dev</a></p>
<p>Welcome to Math Writer and thank you for visiting this page. Math Writer is a rich text web editor for math, utilising the power of MathJax and the featureful TinyMCE text editor. It allows you to enter markdown and math together and aims to be a convenient way to write digital math, particularly for your own websites, with pdf and html export options. It will always be free to use and I welcome suggestions, pull requests and bug reports.</p>
<h2>The Power of MathJax</h2>
<p>All math is entered and rendered in accordance with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, the popular math rendering engine for the web. This means you can enter math either as AsciiMath or LaTex, however I prefer the former for most cases as it reads better in raw form (ultimately it is a personal preference). In addition, a set of handy keyboard shortcuts are included in this editor to aide with commonly used mathematical symbols.</p>
<h2>The Power of TinyMCE</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/">TinyMCE</a> is, by their own admission, the world's most customizable and flexible rich text editor. It provides powerful WYSIWYG functionality and ease of use. By combining TinyMCE with the power of MathJax, I was able to build (what I hope is) a high quality math editor.</p>
<h2>Markdown Works!</h2>
<p>Basic markdown commands like headers (#, ##, ...), italics (*), bold (**) and lists (*, -, 1., a., etc.) work in this editor. So you can think of it as a Markdown Editor with mathematical input.</p>
<h2>Who is the Audience?</h2>
<p>I built this editor for myself, but decided it might be worthwhile for others, hence hosting it online. It is most valuable to those who enter a lot of mathematical content for websites (using MathJax), as it exports nicely to HTML and provides a convenient workflow. It is also useful for those looking for a reasonable quality math editor, who are not yet tied in to LaTeX, MS Word or another option. I believe the editor hits the sweetpot of being able to write WYSIWYG formatted rich text, with the power of mathematical input from AsciiMath &amp; LaTeX, with one-click previews of rendered maths.</p>
<h2>Suggestions &amp; Pull Requests Welcome!</h2>
<p>I would be very happy for others to take this editor and customise it for themselves or morph it into something more. I would love to see AsciiMath become a standard for mathematical input (LaTeX is good too, but I am a big fan of AsciiMath being more readable in raw form), and perhaps this project will help push in that direction.</p>
<h2>Get started!</h2>
<p>To get started, simply navigate to <a href="https://writer.math.dev/">https://writer.math.dev</a>. There is a basic tutorial under the "Read Me" tab. If you like this editor, please do star it on <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna/math-writer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>You can e-mail me at <a href="https://writer.math.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="204153484f4b0e4b48414e4e4160484f544d41494c0e434f4d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> for any queries, suggestions or just a general chat. Thank you again for your time and I hope you enjoy this editor.</p>

February 27, 2021 | https://stu2b50.dev/posts/current-state-of1da9 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stu2b50.dev/posts/current-state-of1da9">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
      <div id="main">
        

    

    <div>
        <p>I'm sure everyone has heard plenty about the excellence of the M1 Macbooks (I have an Air, by the way; a fanless ultraportable with that kind of performance really attracted me), so in the beginning of this post I will stick to pain points and quirks I experienced with the Macbooks and how I solved them (if I could) to serve as a reference for others, leaving the fairly generic "wow m1 good" at the end. </p>
<p>the tl;dr judgement is: for most developers, it's going to be 95% of the way there by now. If you know what you're doing, you can fill that 5%. If you don't, you might have some frustrating googling ahead.</p>
<h3>App Compatibility</h3>
<p>I'm sure everyone has heard enough of how the M1's seamless ability to run x86 applications, but it really has to be said that it's hard to tell that you're running a program that's not in the devices native architecture.</p>
<p>Almost <em>too difficult</em> to tell. I really wanted to make sure I ran everything native that I could - and honestly sometimes it was hard to tell if I was downloading the native or emulated version. Package files don't seem to say if they're universal binaries, so you have to extract them first. I suppose this is not something Apple wants, but I wish there were an easier way to tell if an application was native or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">This database</a> is a good reference. As a side note, it also seems to have awful SEO - I consistently get articles <em>ABOUT</em> the page rather than the page itself. </p>
<p>In any case, my two main languages for my personal works are python and rust. Here is the compatibility status of my most used applications</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Application</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Homebrew</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>macports</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python3</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>VSCode</td><td>Native*</td></tr>
<tr><td>iTerm2</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rust</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>x86</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spotify</td><td>x86</td></tr>
<tr><td>Discord</td><td>x86</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slack</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Native</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chrome</td><td>Native</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>* The stable release of VSCode is not native, but the "Insiders" release is.</p>
<p>Very recently true: Homebrew is native now! </p>
<p>Note that, somewhat ironically, most of the applications that are not native are electron apps - they'll likely gain an M1 native version when they eventually update their electron version (I can understand why that would be more of a challenge than it seems), but it is strange having <em>Chrome</em> work natively but not the apps that depend on it.</p>
<p>For Spotify and Discord, I actually currently run them as Chrome webapps (shortcuts-&gt;launch as window). Works fine, since I'm a fairly light user of both. I did try them as translated, but there were some graphical hitches on Discord (although I seem to be alone on that), and why run translated stripped down Chrome when I'm already running native Chrome?</p>
<p>I have to say, though, Spotify and Discord are all the more disappointing because they also disabled the iPhone clients from being used on Apple silicon. Especially for Spotify - the iPhone version would be perfectly fine for my use case and probably run better to boot!</p>
<p>Slack<em>does</em> have an M1 native version. And so does VSCode. So it seems (as you'd expect) there's no technical reason why the electron apps don't have native versions.</p>
<p>The other major exclusion is Dropbox (yes, I'm apparently one of the few people that still subscribe to dropbox), although it seems to be in the works.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Mouse Issues</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if this was just a weird issue with my specific peripheral configuration or what, but disabling mouse acceleration also crippled the sensitivity of the mouse - so much that even at max DPI on MxMaster, it was still too slow. If you moved the sensitivity in settings, it would re-enable mouse acceleration. </p>
<p>I fixed this in the end with SteerMouse, which allows you to modify the acceleration and sensitivity separately, but I remember that the good ol' <code>defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1</code> would not have this behavior. Probably a Big Sur behavior, rather than an M1 thing, but I'm a little surprised to never see this mentioned. Maybe more people use mouse acceleration than I thought? Am I the weird one?</p>
<hr>
<h3>In the Wild</h3>
<h4>Python</h4>
<p>There were some rough edges. For instance, many of my projects are in python and use postgresql, so I have <code>psycopg2-binary</code> as a dependency on many of them. While running <code>pipenv install</code> (yes, I use <code>poetry</code> now, but some of them predate that and I don't care enough to switch them) I received some linker errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/1200">Here's a github issues thread on it</a></p>
<p>In my case, linking <code>openssl</code> fixed it. <code>psycopg2</code> is popular enough that there were other users having the issue and finding solutions, but it's possible that less used packages, especially ones that have to interface with native code, rather than be pure python, would have issues.</p>
<p>Another python issue came with <code>PyQt5</code>. Trying to install it caused this error</p>
<pre><code>hook = backend.prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel
AttributeError: module 'sipbuild.api' has no attribute 'prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel'
</code></pre>
<p>With an ugly traceback accompanying it. This led me on a wild goose chase with <code>pyqt5-sip</code>, and Googling the error led to no useful outcomes - just people recommending others to upgrade pip. </p>
<p>Turns out, the actual issue was that qmake wasn't in my path. It is building it from source, I suppose? But what a stunningly unhelpful error. The M1 related issue is that the platform is too new for there to be wheels for PyQt5, so it had to built from source. The rest is the python packaging being an idiot.</p>
<h4>Rust</h4>
<p>On the rust side, well, Cargo seems to just compile everything from source anyway, so there's no issues here (although, if you'd believe it, the build directory for this blog, between debug and release, is almost <em>5 GB</em> in size).</p>
<h4>Flutter (and Android)</h4>
<p>I was shocked how easy it was to get the Android toolchain set up. It's running in translation, but I only know that because I checked the binary afterwards. You just install it, and it works, and Flutter has no issues interfacing with it. </p>
<p>I had to use the beta channel of flutter - before then I was hanging on a gradle build - but otherwise this is a stunningly complex chain of technologies and it all works perfectly. I had a flutter app running on my physical Android device. Of course, there is no issues with the iOS toolchain.</p>
<h4>Docker</h4>
<p>I'll admit I'm not a super heavy user of Docker, but it is the elephant in the room. It's released under a Technical Preview (and considering how stable the intel release of docker on MacOS is that's fairly foreboding)... but it seems to work? </p>
<p>Of course, with ARM containers. I believe x86 containers technically can run through QEMU, but boy that is another level of unstable. I think whether or not this is okay will depend on your use case. For me, mostly working on small servers with languages like python, it's fine. </p>
<p>It does break the "contract" that your local and prod environments were virtually the same; the ARM container may not work in the same way as your prod environment. And for some that will be a dealbreaker. You'll have to decide here.</p>
<hr>
<p>The tl;dr seems to be that for more fragile packaging systems, platform binaries for Apple Silicon have not yet been made in many cases, so they must be built from sources, and that can cause issues that other users don't expect. Be aware of that, although it will surely get better over time. And by that I mean Python, since it was where I had by far the most issues, although all were resolvable so far.</p>
<hr>
<h3>A Note on Vertical Stands</h3>
<p>I have a vertical clamshell stand for the first time, since I am no longer afraid of the device's thermal performance. However, I did have one hitch. it's very natural with the Air's wedge shape to put the back of the wedge into the stand, however, if you have a stand that's fully metal, and you center it, the stand can cover up the device's wifi antenna. </p>
<p>With the unibody metal chassis, you need somewhere to stick the wifi antenna, and on modern macbooks that's here</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/current-state-of1da9/macbook" alt=""></p>
<p>on the back, around where the hinge is. I had quite bad wifi performance until I changed this which mystified me for a bit. Just place it in a different orientation (or get a stand that's more airy) and it'll be fine.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The performance is as lovely as everyone has said it is. I did two hours or so of chrome browsing, which reduced the battery by all of 1%. It's icey cold the entire time, too. Surprisingly a big deal when you actually have it on your lap.</p>
<p>The first day I had it, it was just okay - about what you'd expect from a laptop with a powerful CPU. But after a day, and all the first-launch processes like spotlight indexing, OS updates, and so forth finish running, it's noticeably smoother in operation. Especially small things like having the display turn out, changing the resolution, moving windows around. I'm not even sure specifically what causes this; perhaps improvements with the integrated GPU instead?</p>
<p>It really cannot be overstated how cool it runs. The USB-C dongle that is attached to it runs hotter than the chassis of the laptop even after some ostensibly expensive task, like when I compiled Qt5 from source. </p>
<p>Clamshell mode is a game changer too. Never has a clamshell mode worked so well; I rarely used it before because I would always need to manually press the power button, or use the keyboard and touchpad built in whenever it inevitably bugs out. But it just works on the new M1. This is by far the best "laptop-as-desktop" experience I've had.</p>
<p>I really think the Air is the best for developers for now; you get an actual function row, you really don't notice any performance decreases because, other than long from-scratch compiles, the developer workflow is very bursty and not about sustained performance. And you reap the benefits of having no fan; there are zero moving parts in this laptop. </p>
<p>Perhaps the rumored 14'' Pro will change that for those that need more performance (especially RAM), but honestly it is perfectly fine for my purposes.</p>
<p>But so it's been good on the Air, and with most the kinks worked out on my setup, I'm enjoying the benefits, and man are those benefits great.</p>

<p>With its high viscosity, no one would ever pick honey to beat water in a race. But a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5197">new study</a> shows there’s at least one circumstance where honey wins: inside a narrow, <a href="https://fyfluiddynamics.com/tagged/superhydrophobic/">superhydrophobic</a> tube with one or both ends closed. Inside these specially coated tubes a narrow cushion of air stays between the drop and the wall, reducing friction and increasing flow speed for both fluids. </p>



<p>But when one or both ends of the tube are blocked, the drops can only move when air squeezes past. In less viscous fluids, like water, the researchers found rapid internal flows inside the drop. These flows pressed the surface of the drop outward, reducing the air cushion and making it harder for air to squeeze past so that the drop could flow. In contrast, honey showed very little internal flow and so was able to flow through the tubes ten times faster than water!

February 27, 2021 | https://gru.gq/2021/02/28/solarwind-enough-with-the-password-already/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gru.gq/2021/02/28/solarwind-enough-with-the-password-already/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is a much delayed discussion on the complexity and nuance of the SolarWind hack. The simplistic and wrong messaging from some quarters of the infosec community has resulted in an atrocious misunderstanding of the hack in the public sphere. This has extended into the policy world as these bad takes are treated as cogent analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/1341439709487087618?s=21">I wrote this back in December</a>, but months later this <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/solarwinds123-password-intern/index.html">bad analysis is still brought up in the policy space.</a></p>
<h2>Espionage is the second oldest profession</h2>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that with spying, the ends justify the means. This is true for all espionage organisations, the opposition’s and your own. Why is that relevant? Because any standard which is used to hamper the opposition will also apply to, and hamper, yours.</p>
<p>Sometimes laying down blanket rules about acceptable espionage behaviour is not a problem. Almost always this is when a certain type of operation is out of character with the society that produces the espionage agency. China makes extensive use of their diaspora community for espionage. The US has thousands of trained professionals and doesn’t use their diaspora community for organic bottom up collection. The US sometimes coopts civilians (and China has professionals) but generally speaking the diaspora method is one that only China uses extensively.</p>
<p>Extending this a bit further: if an espionage rule was proposed that banned the use of professionals but allowed the use of amateur civilians, China would be able to easily adapt to the new espionage environment. The US would be severely constrained. For this reason, the US wouldn’t sign up to, or abide by, such a requirement. (This is complicated further by the nature of targets for espionage, and national policy, but we can explore that another day.)</p>
<p>This brings me to targeting civilian companies and supply chain attacks. The US uses these methods just as, if not more, frequently than the Russians. FLAME, a strain of malware that targeted entities in the Middle East, exploited a cryptologic bug in the way Microsoft signed their updates. The NSA was then able to inject malicious code into the updates of Microsoft software. And just like SolarWinds, it was specifically targeted to ensure only legitimate espionage targets were infected and collected.</p>
<p><strong>There is no rule that would prohibit the SolarWinds espionage campaign which the US would be willing to abide by itself.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian Intelligence aren’t script kiddies</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing: the attackers are Russian foreign intelligence, the cream of the old KGB, and they will find a way to gain access to their target. Do they need to recruit a developer at the company and trick them into installing malware? They will do that.</p>
<p>They do not need to access the target via a weak password on the build servers. If that is what they use, then that is what they use, but it is not the make or break factor for the operation.</p>
<p>Part of the problem here might be that a superficial understanding of the cyber kill chain gives the impression that if you just stop <strong>The One Critical TTP</strong> in the chain then you will defeat the opposition. This is only true for an opposition that is inflexible and using just one technique. That description does not apply to the Russian intelligence services.</p>
<p>Intelligence agencies have targets and they will find the techniques to access them. The don’t start with a technique and look for targets that they can access.</p>
<p>The SolarWind backdoor was deeply integrated into the code, it was injected during their build process, and there is no way that the server having a weak password was the pivotal factor. As if Russian Intelligence would just give up if there were a strong password instead!</p>
<p>There is practically no chance that the server’s password was in anyway relevant to the hack overall. I can forgive the ignorance from the news media, but some infosec people are repeating this garbage as if it is important part of the SolarWind compromise.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The offense is routinely underestimated. When companies are hacked, they react as if they had only done this one thing or avoided this one mistake everything would have been okay. The adversary is treated as if they just got lucky.” — Network Attacks and Exploitation <a href="https://twitter.com/networkattack">@networkattack</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People suggesting that the weak password example is relevant because it illustrates the poor security practices overall. I would agree with you if that was the argument presented. It was not. You have to work with the words ppl said, not what you wish they’d said.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘’Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds’ update server by using the password “solarwinds123”<br>
“This could have been done by any attacker, easily,” Kumar said.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I absolutely agree with the “it is illustrative of poor security practice” but… that isn’t what was said. They literally said that the weak password means that the attacker could be anyone. Anyone could do it. That is the dumbest take.</p>
<h2>The KGB vs a software vendor? Bet KGB.</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<p>I’m perfectly willing to believe that their build servers were using “admin:admin” and that’s how the Russians gained access to inject their code… but, this was a clandestine intelligence operation. They did not succeed merely because SolarWind had poor password hygiene.</p>
<p>The SVR was formed from the cream of the KGB — the first chief directorate (FCD). The most prestigious directorate in the KGB. As the SVR they are still formidable.</p>
<h2>Was SolarWind picked due to its poor security?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I suspect the primary motivation was the access that would be enabled by the attack, not the vulnerable nature of the company. This is the SVR, the cream of the KGB (first chief directorate). They are not going to be bothered by password policy.</p>
<p>That’s what kinda annoys me… however easy SolarWind may have been to hack, they were hacked by the fucking First Chief Directorate of the KGB. Quite possibly the people that are frying diplomats brains with microwaves in Havana. They’re pretty fucking metal.</p>
<p>Could SolarWind have been too difficult for the KGB to use them in an enablement operation? Yes, it is possible to achieve that level of security. Creating a strong fast detection capability with rapid remediation and incident response will make it hard for attackers to dwell for any length of time, or persist on the system after they gain access. It requires vigilance and some effort, but it can be done. Of course, SolarWind wasn’t close to reaching that level.</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code</a> is a popular yearly programming competition. It's an
Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and
levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.</p>
<p>Puzzles are released daily throughout December. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/stats">More</a> than 150k
people take part in this event. The toughest battle to solve each puzzle as soon
as possible to become the best on the global <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard">leaderboard</a>.</p>
<p>In my timezone, puzzles are released at 6 o'clock in the morning. Since I'm a
night owl, the biggest challenge for me here is to get up so early. I,
therefore, set a different goal instead.</p>

<p>I want to develop a standalone, short, compact, fast and, elegant solution for
each problem this year. In past competitions, I took part using the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
language. I've been using it a lot for other projects lately, and believe it is
a fantastic language to build performant, secure, and robust software. This has
always sparked my interest so Rust is a good fit.</p>
<p>Last year I came across <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/solving-advent-of-code-in-under-a-second/">this</a> article, solving all puzzles in
under a second. Yes, in less than one second total. This inspired me to
challenge myself to the same this year:</p>
<p><em>Solving Advent of Code 2020 in under a second on a single CPU core.</em></p>
<p>Spoiler alert: I succeeded!</p>

</h2>
<p>In this article, I'd like to show you some optimizations I found appealing which
I used to keep the solutions blazingly fast. I'll only talk about the most
significant optimizations and the interesting bits. Most are algorithmic and are
consequently language agnostic.</p>
<p>I'm just using basic time measurements on my machine. I won't be theoretically
proving the efficiency of an approach. I optimized the runtime of my solutions
based on my personal input. I did not make assumptions other than what is clear
from the puzzle description though, so each solution should work for all inputs
with comparable runtime. All user input is similar after all.</p>
<p>I hope this article will present you with some out-of-the-box approaches you can
take away to make your future code more performant. Hence this piece is intended
for programmers that value performance.</p>

that have a sum of 2020. All numbers are around 1000, so we're likely trying to
find a pair of 3 small numbers.</p>

find the correct pair, which decreases the runtime from <code>1.38ms</code> to <code>7μs</code>.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9#part2">day 9 part 2</a> we must find a sequence of numbers in a list of
numbers that sums up to a specific value.</p>
<p>The common approach seems to be to use a <code>for</code> in a <code>for</code> loop. This walks
over each position with the outer loop and tries to find a sequence with the
correct sum with the inner loop.</p>
<p>I'm <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day09b/src/main.rs#L9-L20">using</a> a <em>dynamic sliding window</em> approach instead (I better
give it a fancy name you know). I start by sliding the <em>head</em> forward, making
the window and the sum larger. When the sum becomes larger than the target value
I stop. Then I start sliding the <em>tail</em> forward, making the window and the
sequence sum smaller. When the sum becomes smaller than the target value I stop.</p>
<pre><code><span>   &gt;&gt; tail &gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; head &gt;&gt;
         |           |
         +-----------+

         +-----------+
         | tot: 127  |
</span></code></pre>
<p>I keep alternating between sliding the <em>head</em> and <em>tail</em>. Once the sum equals
the target value, we've found the sequence and can solve the puzzle. This
minimizes the number of required loops, making it more efficient.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10#part2">day 10 part 2</a> we get a list of adapter voltages. Adapters may be
plugged into each other if the adapter is 1 to 3 volts higher than the adapter
you're plugging into. The puzzle is to figure out how many distinct adapter
arrangements are possible.</p>
<p>I started with a sorted list because you can only plug higher-rated adapters
into lower-rated ones. The maximum difference is 3, so I soon discovered that
you can chunk the sequence of adapters. Each chunk of adapters has a difference
of 3, which only gives one way to connect between them. You can now process each
chunk separately to find distinct arrangements, multiplying their calculations.</p>
<pre><code><span>Chunks with adapters:

C1 &gt;&gt; C2 &gt;&gt; C3 &gt;&gt; C4 &gt;&gt; C5
--    --    --    --    --
1     4     10    15    19
      5     11    16
      6     12
      7
--    --    --    --    --
1x    7x    4x    2x    1x

Ways to connect:

1  +  7  +  4  +  2  +  1  =  15
</span></code></pre>
<p>This resulted in chunks that always consisted of 2, 3, or 4 adapters. This makes
it easy to find distinctions between them. I finally figured that I could
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day10b/src/main.rs#L13-L20">optimize</a> it to a <em>fixed number of distinctions per chunk size</em>
greatly reducing complexity.</p>
<p>I found 74049191673856 distinct ways to connect all adapters in just <code>5μs</code>. I
can't even count to 1 within that time.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11">day 11 part 1</a> we're given a variation of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of
Life</a> represented as a 2D arrangement of seats on a plane. Each iteration
seat occupation changes based on a set of rules considering their neighbors, but
seats don't move.</p>
<pre><code><span>L.LL.LL.LL    L = empty seat
LLLLLLL.LL    . = nothing
L.L.L..L..
LLLL.LL.LL
L.LL.LL.LL
L.LLLLL.LL
..L.L.....
LLLLLLLLLL
L.LLLLLL.L
L.LLLLL.LL
</span></code></pre>
<p>With regular <em>Game of Life</em> you'd have to loop through all positions each
iteration and evaluate all rules to determine their new state. Because this
puzzle does not have a seat at every position (nor do seats always have 4
neighbors) our plane is more like a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array">sparse array</a>. A lot of
cycles would be wasted if we'd keep looping over all plane positions.</p>
<p>I decided to make a list of all seat positions and their respective neighbors.
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day11a/src/main.rs#L38-L54">This</a> way I only had to go through this list of seats for each
iteration. Determining what neighbors a seat has just needs to be performed
once.</p>
<p>This is especially great for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11#part2">part 2</a> which makes things worse. It
doesn't just consider direct neighbors anymore, but neighbors in line of sight
making searching much more expensive. Luckily it doesn't affect my approach from
the first part too much, as I only search <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day11b/src/main.rs#L28-L39">once</a>. This is much more
efficient than looping through all positions and finding neighbors every time.</p>

<p>On <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12">day 12 part 1</a> we're given a sequence of navigation instructions for
a ship. It includes cardinal directions, rotation, and forward instructions. We
must figure out the distance between the start and destination position.</p>
<p>What makes this tricky is the rotation and forward instructions. The forward
movement is dependent on your current rotation.</p>
<p>I use a single byte of which the first 4 bits define the current rotation. The
first bit means north, the second bit means east, et cetera. Because the ship
starts looking east, I start with the <code>0b01000100</code> pattern. For each rotation
instruction, I simply <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#bit_rotation">rotate</a> the bits left or right. Rotating
right would update the direction to <code>0b00100010</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>Direction bits, shift to rotate 90 degrees left or right:

    &lt;&lt; rotate left &lt;&lt;               &gt;&gt; rotate right &gt;&gt;

... &lt;&gt; 01000100 &lt;&gt; 00100010 &lt;&gt; 00010001 &lt;&gt; 10001000 &lt;&gt; ...


                Bit meaning:

              [ y-1 ] [ y+1 ]
              [north] [south]
                    | |
Direction bits  00100010  would move ship south (y+1)
                     | |
                [east] [west]
                [ x+1] [x-1 ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>To move forward I <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2020/blob/b8c6e75e3844714fe8fa229afa618941bd219e79/day12a/src/main.rs#L12-L18">take</a> this direction byte and use bitwise
arithmetic to update the ship position. This removes branching (<code>if</code> statements
and such) you'd normally expect for logic like this. Quite elegant.</p>

For instance, to rotate the image, and modify its size, we would pass this data:</p><pre><code><span><span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"y"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"width"</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"height"</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>  <span>"rotate"</span><span>:</span> <span>90</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then, in WordPress 5.6, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/20/rest-api-batch-framework-in-wordpress-5-6/">batch operations</a> were introduced to the WP REST API.</p><p>Finally, in the upcoming WordPress 5.7, the operations to apply on the image have been decoupled, so we have operations <code>"crop"</code> and <code>"rotate"</code>. These operations can be executed on their own, but also together on the same request via batching.</p><p>As seen earlier on, passing data to the endpoint now looks much more elegant:</p><pre><code><span><span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>"modifiers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>    <span>{</span></span><br><span>      <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"crop"</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>      <span>"args"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>"left"</span>  <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>"top"</span>   <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>"width"</span> <span>:</span> <span>80</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>        <span>"height"</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>    <span>{</span></span><br><span>      <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"rotate"</span><span>,</span></span><br><span>      <span>"args"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>"angle"</span><span>:</span> <span>90</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="heading-re-doing-what-already-exists">Re-doing what already exists?<a href="#heading-re-doing-what-already-exists"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The WP REST API is not the only API for WordPress.

					Having a memory of past events enables us to take smarter decisions about the future. Researchers at the Max-Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPI-DS) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now identified how the slime mold Physarum polycephalum saves memories – although it has no nervous system.
				</p></header><section><p>The ability to store and recover information gives an organism a clear advantage when searching for food or avoiding harmful environments. Traditionally it has been attributed to organisms that have a nervous system.</p><p>A new study authored by Mirna Kramar (MPI-DS) and <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/alim-karen" title="Profile of Prof. Dr. Karen Alim" target="_blank">Prof. Karen Alim</a> (TUM and MPI-DS) challenges this view by uncovering the surprising abilities of a highly dynamic, single-celled organism to store and retrieve information about its environment.</p><div id="c62766"><div><div><p>The slime mold Physarum polycephalum has been puzzling researchers for many decades. Existing at the crossroads between the kingdoms of animals, plants and fungi, this unique organism provides insight into the early evolutionary history of eukaryotes – to which also humans belong.</p><p>Its body is a giant single cell made up of interconnected tubes that form intricate networks. This single amoeba-like cell may stretch several centimeters or even meters, featuring as the largest cell on earth in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p></div></div></div><div id="c62767"><div><div><p>“It is very exciting when a project develops from a simple experimental observation”, says Karen Alim, head of the Biological Physics and Morphogenesis group at the MPI-DS in Göttingen and professor for the <a href="http://www.bpm.ph.tum.de/" target="_blank">Theory of Biological Networks</a> at the Technical University of Munich.</p><p>When the researchers followed the migration and feeding process of the organism and observed a distinct imprint of a food source on the pattern of thicker and thinner tubes of the network long after feeding.</p><p>“Given P. polycephalum's highly dynamic network reorganization, the persistence of this imprint sparked the idea that the network architecture itself could serve as memory of the past“, says Karen Alim. However, they first needed to explain the mechanism behind the imprint formation.</p></div></div></div><div id="c62768"><div><div><p>For this purpose the researchers combined microscopic observations of the adaption of the tubular network with theoretical modeling. An encounter with food triggers the release of a chemical that travels from the location where food was found throughout the organism and softens the tubes in the network, making the whole organism reorient its migration towards the food.</p><p>“The gradual softening is where the existing imprints of previous food sources come into play and where information is stored and retrieved”, says first author Mirna Kramar. “Past feeding events are embedded in the hierarchy of tube diameters, specifically in the arrangement of thick and thin tubes in the network.”</p><p>“For the softening chemical that is now transported, the thick tubes in the network act as highways in traffic networks, enabling quick transport across the whole organism”, adds Mirna Kramar. “Previous encounters imprinted in the network architecture thus weigh into the decision about the future direction of migration.”</p></div></div></div><div id="c62769"><div><div><p>„Given the simplicity of this living network, the ability of Physarum to form memories is intriguing. It is remarkable that the organism relies on such a simple mechanism and yet controls it in such a fine-tuned manner,” says Karen Alim.</p><p>“These results present an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the behavior of this ancient organism and at the same time points to universal principles underlying behavior. We envision potential applications of our findings in designing smart materials and building soft robots that navigate through complex environments”, concludes Karen Alim.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<p>You can get the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2WWNsjq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="development-of-brains">Development of brains</h2>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<h2 id="agricultural-revolution">Agricultural Revolution</h2>

<figure>

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

<!-- How the agricultural revolution led to individual suffering -> -->

<!-- 6: Building Pyramids -->

<!-- This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature. -->

<h3 id="imagined-realities---solving-the-co-ordination-problem">Imagined Realities - Solving the co-ordination problem</h3>

<p>According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation.</p>

<p>A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and …</p></div></div>

<p>If families are people, and corporations are people, it stands to reason that families should be allowed to incorporate and file their taxes accordingly.</p>
<p>The benefits to incorporating are fairly obvious: corporations are taxed on their net income, and they enjoy a lower tax rate. Families, on the other hand, pay taxes on their revenue. And while families enjoy a few miscellaneous deductions and credits, they largely miss out on the good stuff. Corporations get to deduct nearly all capital expenditures; families receive no direct tax benefit for feeding their kids, purchasing clothes, buying a minivan, filling that minivan with unleaded, homeschooling or other education expenses, fixing a furnace, upgrading technology, or even moving to a safer neighborhood. If a corporation can demonstrate a net loss on the year, even due to its own aggressive spending habits, it doesn’t pay taxes. If a family loses money, the tax code doesn’t care.<span id="more-3557"></span></p>
<p>As a result, families pay a disproportionate share of federal tax receipts. In <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p55b.pdf">2019</a>, individuals paid just under 70 percent of all federal taxes, while corporations paid just 25 percent. Take payroll taxes out of the equation, and those numbers become even more lopsided: individuals paid nearly $1.6 trillion to the federal government while corporations paid about $226 billion.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that corporations should be taxed on their revenue, or that we should dramatically increase corporate taxes. Lower taxes and reduced regulatory burdens can, at least in theory, encourage capital formation. So if Republicans are so eager to pass a $1.7 trillion, unfunded corporate tax cut on the belief that it would spur business investment, as they did in 2017, shouldn’t they be willing to consider a similar approach to other forms of capital formation—namely, human capital formation?</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a fertility crisis, which only worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. has already reached an all-time-low fertility rate of 1.71 births per woman, and Brookings estimates that there will be a “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/half-a-million-fewer-children-the-coming-covid-baby-bust/">baby bust</a>” in 2021 of at least 300,000 fewer American births. The long-term effects of such a decline in human capital would be far-reaching. Shrinking populations don’t often lend themselves to growing economies.</p>
<p>Financial pressures are one of the main, addressable sources of the crisis. As American Compass’s recent Home Building Survey <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/home-building-survey-part-1/">showed</a>, half of parenting-age adults want more children than they currently have. And for all but the most well-off, these parents cite the inability to afford more children as the primary reason for this deficit.</p>
<p>If we were to find a similar impediment to the formation or growth of American businesses, wouldn’t we do something about it? Wouldn’t we have done something already?</p>
<p>We could create new deductions or expand existing credits to attempt to level the playing field between corporations and families. Options include: boosting the Child Tax Credit, reworking the Earned Income Tax Credit, extending the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit beyond two dependents or above the current $6,000 cap, or even expanding the scope of 529 savings accounts to include all K-12 schooling options.</p>
<p>Or, we could go big and allow families access to the same tax treatment that Amazon and General Electric enjoy. Instead of a Child Tax Credit, let families write off their grocery bills. Instead of deductions for mortgage interest that only kick in if tax filers earn enough income to itemize, let families deduct all housing costs. Instead of an inadequate childcare deduction, let families deduct the entire expense. Why not? Families are corporations, my friend.</p>
<p>For decades, supply-side ideology has led Republicans to cut taxes and regulation on behalf of corporations. Now, as financial pressures constrain the supply of future Americans, we should embrace supply-side <em>oikonomics</em> and let families incorporate.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, in the Fabulous Land of Web Shops Where Rivers Are Made of Honey, there was me, fresh and young PHP developer with little experience, and my colleague and team leader, who was in the industry for 10 years.</p>
<p>It was the evening, at the office. I was pretty tired, but we had to develop a backend for an important client quickly, as always. I was in charge to develop a part of it.</p>
<p>My team leader was full of passion, agitating a weird diagram full of boxes and arrows:</p>
<p>“Here’s my idea. We should first create two interfaces, put two decorators here and maybe three factories above; we need the system to be flexible as much as we can, the client expect to keep his backend for 20 years!”.</p>
<p>My knowledge in design pattern was pretty poor at that time; heck, I even had difficulty to understand the difference between inheritance and composition. I was looking at his schema like Champollion might have looked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosetta Stone</a> for the first time, bringing more questions than answer.</p>
<p>Speaking of questions, they were first flowing from my mouth: what’s a decorator? Why do we create interfaces? Why this factory, there? The explanations brought even more complex concepts I couldn’t really grasp either. The <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/programmer-stress-causes/">stress of the impostor syndrome</a> was beginning to kick in heavily. I was a fraud, a newbie who wanted to play in the gods’ playground.</p>
<p>My brain was boiling.  Sweat was pearling on my forehead. My confusion was growing proportionally to the amount of explanation given. The cleaning lady began to turn on her vacuum cleaner. I gave up, said yes to everything and went home.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the project didn’t go well. My team leader reproached me not to ask enough question for me to understand. Apparently, I wasn’t helping them enough to teach me correctly.</p>
<p>Why was that? I didn’t understand what was happening, but I swear to the Twelve Gods that I would remember this experience not to reproduce it. I wanted to be a better mentor when it would be my turn to be the Senior Ninja Developer of the Wizardry Crown explaining magic tricks to my apprentices.</p>
<p>At the same time, I knew that my team leader was not the only one responsible for my confusion. I was, too, and maybe even more than him. This lead me to another quest: <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/learning-developer-efficiently-effectively/">learning how to learn</a>.</p>
<p>Years forward, a miracle happened. I stumbled upon the theory of the expert blind spot, finally explaining partly what happened on this cursed project.</p>
<p>Why do I bother you with my life, you might wonder? As developers, we inevitably work with other developers who don’t know everything. It’s important to know how to share our knowledge.</p>
<p>Teaching is one of the best way of testing yourself that you understood what you’ve learned; teaching and learning are tightly linked. Doing it well will increase your understanding of any subject and, therefore, your level of expertise.</p>










  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote>
  <p>While we teach, we learn.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>However, to teach well, we need to understand and avoid the <em>expert blind spot</em>. This might begin to explain why, in my experience, good developers are not necessarily good teacher.</p>
<p>This article will specifically speak about teaching from a person to another. I believe that things are a bit different when you try to learn by yourself with a book, for example.</p>
<p>Here’s the menu for today:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I’ll explain what’s the expert blind spot.</li>
<li>Second, we will speak about the cognitive load theory in general, how understanding and learning work, and why the expert blind spot is a consequence of our learning process.</li>
<li>Finally, I’ll speak about principles as well as actionable solutions to avoid the filthy expert blind spot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it’s time to embark together in this fabulous journey!</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-expert-blind-spot">What’s the Expert Blind Spot?</h2>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p>To answer what’s the expert blind spot, we shall first define what’s an expert is, to be sure we agree on the semantic of the key terms. From the <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/expert_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford Dictionary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person with special knowledge, skill, or training in something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the obvious, I like to define expert as well as somebody who knows what he doesn’t know, as mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>.</p>
<p>According to this theory, a beginner has often a lot of confidence about his own knowledge and skills, because he’s not aware about what he doesn’t know. Thus, he thinks he knows a lot. This is called illusion of competence.</p>
<p>More you become skilled and knowledgeable, more you’ll know what you need to focus on to increase your expertise.</p>










  
  
  
  





  


<blockquote>
  <p>We live on an island surrounded by a sea of ignorance. As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>Even if an expert is more aware about what he doesn’t know, he’s not necessarily aware about what he knows <em>in details</em>. This sound pretty weird, but it’s exactly what the expert blind spot is.</p>
<p>Even if he forgot the details of what he knows, our expert can still apply his knowledge to perform tasks, but he will only use a <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-software-development/">higher level of abstractions</a> of it.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>If an expert can still use the knowledge he’s not entirely aware of anymore, why is it a problem, you might ask, rightfully?</p>
<p>A developer, explaining to a beginner his knowledge, will brush away everything he’s not consciously aware of anymore. The learner, even if he needs this hidden knowledge to understand and learn the whole concept, won’t be able to access it. Thus, he won’t understand.</p>
<p>As a result, the expert won’t understand why the beginner doesn’t understand. After all, for the expert, the concept is obvious.</p>
<p>The learner, on the other side, won’t be able to ask the good questions, since he’s not aware about what he doesn’t know. This brings us back to the lengthy story I was narrating in the introduction.</p>
<p>Even worst: the beginner might <em>misunderstand</em> what the expert try to teach without even knowing it. Absence of knowledge is better than misconceptions, which are the <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/confident-idiots-92793" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basis of ignorance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-on-earth-there-is-such-a-thing-as-the-expert-blind-spots">Why On Earth There Is Such a Thing as the Expert Blind Spots?</h2>
<p>Researches on cognitive learning show us why there’s such a thing as the expert blind spot. First, we need to see how cognitive learning works.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-memories">Types of Memories</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/images/stories/PDF/cognitive-load-theory-VR_AA3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive load theory</a>, we have two types of memory: the working memory and the long term memory.</p>
<h4 id="the-working-memory">The Working Memory</h4>
<p>The working memory is very limited in space (we can only process 4 <em>elements of information</em> at the same time) and time (around 20s). These numbers can change from an individual to another.</p>
<p>You can use this memory to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a new resource.</li>
<li>Perform a task.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, problems pop up when you try to learn too much at the same time. Your working memory can’t process everything simultaneously, because of its limited space.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you perform a task, you need to <em>recall</em> what you have in your long term memory (what you learnt) in the working memory to do that task, with the same spatial constraints. That’s why <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/kiss-principle-explained/">simplicity is so important</a> in software development.</p>

<figcaption>Attempt to learn the Linux pipe</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="the-long-term-memory">The Long Term Memory</h4>
<p>When you learn a new resource using effective learning methods, what’s in your working memory will go in your long term memory. To do so, you need to <em>understand</em> the knowledge you’re trying to process.</p>
<p>To understand, you need to have every <em>piece of information</em> required in your working memory. From there, you’ll create <em>schemata</em> (plural of schema, if you wonder) in your long term memory to organize this knowledge.</p>
<p>Later, you can use your new schemata to perform a task.</p>

<figcaption>Understanding the Linux pipe thanks to new pieces of information and prior knowledge of the command line.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="pieces-of-information-and-chunking">Pieces of information and Chunking</h3>
<p>We didn’t define what a <em>piece of information</em> is. Each of them will occupy one spot in your working memory. The content itself will depend on what is learned and who’s learning it.</p>
<p>What’s in your long term memory are layers of schemata abstracting one another. When performing a task, you need to reduce the number of schemata you bring back to your working memory not to overload it.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. Carl, your colleague developer, is running a shiny Ubuntu in his powerful laptop. He wants to know how many files, with names beginning with a “z”, are in a folder.</p>
<p>In my example, you are the famous command line expert of the whole company. Naturally, because of your extreme empathy and your out-of-this-world generosity, you come to help to solve his problem.</p>
<p>“Hey Carl!”, you said, in the most friendly tone a human can produce. “It’s super easy! All you have to do is a good old <code>ls | grep "^z" | wc -l</code>. You see, you first run <code>ls</code>, you pipe with <code>grep</code>, <code>wc</code> and voilà! Your dreams come true!”</p>
<p>However, Carl doesn’t have your knowledge. Raised in the comfortable and boring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GUI</a> world, he doesn’t understand anything of your magical skills. He knows <code>ls</code>, but he doesn’t understand what a pipe is, and he has an artificial understanding of regular expressions. What about <code>grep</code> and <code>wc</code>? He has no clue whatsoever.</p>
<p>Do you think he would understand your explanation? I’m doubtful too. When you type your command line, you don’t have to remind yourself (bring from your long term memory to your limited working memory) what a pipe is and how it works.
The whole concept is abstracted under the word <code>pipe</code> for you. You don’t need to even think about it. The concept is <em>automatically</em> applied to your task at hand.</p>
<p>Because of your expertise in the command line, you save space in your working memory. It reduces the mental energy you need to perform that task, too.</p>
<p>For Carl, things are different. To understand this command, he has to bring the concept of pipe into his working memory, what’s <code>grep</code>, what’s <code>wc</code>, how regular expressions work, and link all of that.</p>
<p>It’s a lot. Too much, even for a command which seems so trivial to you. Unfortunately, you have fallen into the expert blind …</p></section></article></div></div>

February 27, 2021 | https://fy.blackhats.net.au/blog/html/2021/02/16/against_packaging_rust_crates.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fy.blackhats.net.au/blog/html/2021/02/16/against_packaging_rust_crates.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="against-packaging-rust-crates">

<p>Recently the discussion has once again come up around the notion of packaging Rust crates as
libraries in distributions. For example, taking a library like <cite>serde</cite> and packaging it to
an RPM. While I use RPM as the examples here it applies equally to other formats.</p>
<p>Proponents of crate packaging want all Rust applications to use the “distributions” versions of a crate.
This is to prevent “vendoring” or “bundling”. This is where an
application (such as 389 Directory Server) ships all of it’s sources, as well as the sources of
it’s Rust dependencies in a single archive. These sources may differ in version from the bundled
sources of other applications.</p>
<div id="packaging-crates-is-not-reinventing-cargo">
<h2>“Packaging crates is not reinventing Cargo”</h2>
<p>This is a common claim by advocates of crate packaging. However it is easily disproved:</p>
<p><em>If packaging is not reinventing cargo, I am free to use all of Cargo’s features without conflicts to distribution packaging.</em></p>
<p>The reality is that packaging crates <em>is</em> reinventing Cargo - but without all it’s features. Common
limitations are that Cargo’s exact version/less than requirements can not be used safely, or Cargo’s ability to
apply patches or uses sources from specific git revisions can not be used at all.</p>
<p>As a result, this hinders upstreams from using all the rich features within Cargo to comply with
distribution packaging limitations, or it will cause the package to hit exceptions in policy and
necesitate vendoring anyway.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-vendor-only-in-these-exceptional-cases">
<h2>“You can vendor only in these exceptional cases …”</h2>
<p>As noted, since packaging is reinventing Cargo, if you use features of Cargo that are unsupported
then you may be allowed to vendor depending on the distributions policy. However, this raises some
interesting issues itself.</p>
<p>Assume I have been using distribution crates for a period of time - then the upstream adds an exact version
or git revision requirement to a project or a dependency in my project. I now need to change my spec file and tooling to use vendoring
and all of the benefits of distribution crates no longer exists (because you can not have any dependency
in your tree that has an exact version rule).</p>
<p>If the upstream ‘un-does’ that change, then I need to roll back to distribution crates since
the project would no longer be covered by the exemption.</p>
<p>This will create review delays and large amounts of administrative overhead. It means pointless effort to swap between
vendored and distribution crates based on small upstream changes. This may cause packagers to avoid
certain versions or updates so that they do not need to swap between distribution methods.</p>
<p>It’s very likely that these “exceptional” cases will be very common, meaning that vendoring will be occuring.
This necesitates supporting vendored applications in distribution packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-don-t-need-to-package-the-universe">
<h2>“You don’t need to package the universe”</h2>
<p>Many proponents say that they have “already packaged most things”. For example in 389 Directory Server
of our 60 dependencies, only 2 were missing in Fedora (2021-02). However this overlooks the fact
that I do not want to package those 2 other crates just to move forward. I want to support 389 Directory Server
the <em>application</em> not all of it’s dependencies in a distribution.</p>
<p>This is also before we come to larger rust projects, such as Kanidm that has nearly 400 dependencies. The
likelihood that many of them are missing is high.</p>
<p>So you will need to package the universe. Maybe not all of it. But still a lot of it. It’s already
hard enough to contribute packages to a distribution. It becomes even harder when I need to submit 3, 10, or 100
more packages. It could be months before enough approvals were in place. It’s a staggering
amount of administration and work, which will discourage many contributors.</p>
<p>People have already contacted me to say that if they had to package crates to distribution packages to
contribute, they would give up and walk away. We’ve already lost future contributors.</p>
<p>Further to this Ruby, Python and many other languages today all recommend language native tools
such as rvm or virtualenv to avoid using distribution packaged libraries.</p>
<p>Packages in distributions should exist as a vehicle to ship bundled applications that are created
from their language native tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="we-will-update-your-dependencies-for-you">
<h2>“We will update your dependencies for you”</h2>
<p>A supposed benefit is that versions of crates in distributions will be updated in the background
according to semver rules.</p>
<p>If we had an exact version requirement (that was satisfiable), a silent background update will cause
this to no longer work - and will break the application from building. This would necesitate one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A change to the Cargo.toml to remove the equality requirement - a requirement that may exist for good reason.</li>
<li>It will force the application to temporarily swap to vendoring instead.</li>
<li>The application will remain broken and unable to be updated until upstream resolves the need for the equality requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Background updates also ignore the state of your Cargo.lock file by removing it. A Cargo.lock file
is recommended to be checked in with binary applications in Rust, as evidence that shows “here is
an exact set of dependencies that upstream has tested and verified as building and working”.</p>
<p>To remove and ignore this file, means to remove the guarantees of quality from an upstream.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that packagers will run the entire test suite of an application to regain this
confidence. They will “apply the patch and pray” method - as they already do with other languages.</p>
<p>We can already see how background updates can have significant negative consequences on application stability. FreeIPA
has hundreds of dependencies, and it’s common that if any of them changes in small ways, it can cause
FreeIPA to fall over. This is not the fault of FreeIPA - it’s the fault of relying on so many small
moving parts that can change underneath your feet without warning. FreeIPA would strongly benefit from
vendoring to improve it’s stability and quality.</p>
<p>Inversely, it can cause hesitation to updating libraries - since there is now a risk of breaking
other applications that depend on them. We do not want people to be afraid of updates.</p>
</div>
<div id="we-can-respond-to-security-issues">
<h2>“We can respond to security issues”</h2>
<p>On the surface this is a strong argument, but in reality it does not hold up. The security issues
that face Rust are significantly different to that which affect C. In C it may be viable to patch
and update a dynamic library to fix an issue. It saves time because you only need to update and change
one library to fix everything.</p>
<p>Security issues are much rarer in Rust. When they occur, you will have to update and re-build all
applications depending on the affected library.</p>
<p>Since this rebuilding work has to occur, where the security fix is applied is irrelevant. This frees
us to apply the fixes in a different way to how we approach C.</p>
<p>It is better to apply the fixes in a consistent and universal manner. There <em>will</em> be applications
that are vendored due to vendoring exceptions, there is now duplicated work and different
processes to respond to both distribution crates, and vendored applications.</p>
<p>Instead all applications could be vendored, and tooling exists that would examine the Cargo.toml to
check for insecure versions (RustSec/cargo-audit does this for example). The Cargo.toml’s can be
patched, and applications tested and re-vendored. Even better is these changes could easily then be forwarded to
upstreams, allowing every distribution and platform to benefit from the work.</p>
<p>In the cases that the upstream can not fix the issue, then Cargo’s native patching tooling can
be used to supply fixes directly into vendored sources for rare situations requiring it.</p>
</div>
<div id="patching-20-vulnerable-crates-doesn-t-scale-we-need-to-patch-in-one-place">
<h2>“Patching 20 vulnerable crates doesn’t scale, we need to patch in one place!”</h2>
<p>A common response to the previous section is that the above process won’t scale as we need to find
and patch 20 locations compared to just one. It will take “more human effort”.</p>
<p>Today, when a security fix comes out, every distribution’s security teams will have to be made aware of
this. That means - OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Arch, and many more groups all have to
become aware and respond. Then each of these projects security teams will work with their maintainers
to build and update these libraries. In the case of SUSE and Red Hat this means that multiple developers
may be involved, quality engineering will be engaged to test these changes. Consumers of that library
will re-test their applications in some cases to ensure there are no faults of the components they
rely upon. This is all before we approach the fact that each of these distributions have many supported
and released versions they likely need to maintain so this process may be repeated for patching and
testing multiple versions in parallel.</p>
<p>In this process there are a few things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a huge amount of human effort today to keep on top of security issues in our distributions.</li>
<li>Distributions tend to be isolated and can’t share the work to resolve these - the changes to the rpm specs in SUSE won’t help Debian for example.</li>
<li>Human error occurs in all of these layers causing security issues to go un-fixed or breaking a released application.</li>
</ul>
<p>To suggest that rust and vendoring somehow makes this harder or more time consuming is discounting
the huge amount of time, skill, and effort already put in by people to keep our C based distributions functioning
today.</p>
<p>Vendored Rust won’t make this process easier or harder - it just changes the nature of the effort
we have to apply as maintainers and distributions. It shifts our focus from “how do we ensure this
library is secure” to “how do we ensure this <em>application</em> made from many libraries is secure”. It
allows further collaboration with upstreams to be involved in the security update process, which ends up
benefiting <em>all</em> distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="it-doesn-t-duplicate-effort">
<h2>“It doesn’t duplicate effort”</h2>
<p>It does. By the very nature of both distribution libraries and vendored applications needing to
exist in a distribution, there will become duplicated but seperate processes and …</p></div></div></div>

February 27, 2021 | https://blog.pd-andy.dev/phantom-types-in-gleam | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.pd-andy.dev/phantom-types-in-gleam">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this post we're going to be looking at a more advanced use of <a target="_blank" href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a>'s type system, known as phantom types. Hopefully by the end of this you'll have another tool in your belt to help you better model data in your programs. And fear not, because many languages support phantom types (most common functional programming languages support them, but so do others like Rust, and TypeScript, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://marcosh.github.io/post/2020/05/26/phantom-types-in-php.html">PHP</a>) so you can apply this knowledge elsewhere! </p>
<p>Before we get stuck into some examples, let's tackle the obvious question.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-phantom-types">What are phantom types?</h2>
<p>A phantom type is a type parameter that appears on the left hand side of a type's definition but not on the right hand side. In other words, it's a type parameter that is never used by any of a type's constructors.</p>
<pre><code>pub type Example(phantom) {
    Example
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Example</code> type we have a type parameter, <code>phantom</code>, that isn't used in the type's constructor. Phantom types can be used to provide additional safety or context to values without paying the runtime cost of carrying additional data around. Everything is handled at compile time!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In some languages, the compiler may emit a warning (or refuse to compile at all) when a type has unused type parameters. Often there are language-specific solutions to this, like <a target="_blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/struct.PhantomData.html">PhantomData</a> in Rust or <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@dhruvrajvanshi/advanced-typescript-patterns-6cf8826c7944">impossible fields</a> in TypeScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of this article will see us going over <strong>four</strong> different scenarios where phantom types can come in to play. The whole article is a bit long so if any of the examples describes a scenario that fits you perfectly, feel free to jump straight to it!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-one-dealing-with-ids">Example One: Dealing with Ids.</h2>
<p>To understand why phantom types might be useful, let's start with a common scenario. Imagine we're building a social blogging platform like <a target="_blank" href="http://dev.to/">dev.to</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://medium.com/">medium.com</a>. We want to support different users and blog posts, so we assign a unique id to all of these things.</p>
<p>We're a scrappy, fast-moving startup so we implement the simplest possible system for managing IDs: just type aliasing <code>Int</code>s to get things going.</p>
<pre><code>pub type Id = Int

pub fn next (id: Id) -&gt; Id {
    id + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our platform supports Reddit-style upvoting or liking of posts, and we have a function just for that. It takes in the <code>Id</code> of a post to upvote and the <code>Id</code> of the user that upvoted it, and does some magic to make the upvote happen.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn upvote_post (user_id: Id, post_id: Id) -&gt; Nil {
    // Get a post from the database and upvote it.
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This lets us rush to production, but maybe you've already spotted a potential problem with what we have so far. It's only a matter of time until someone gets the parameters the wrong way round and now a totally unrelated user has upvoted a random post.</p>
<p>One solution would be to stop aliasing <code>Int</code> and define new types for <code>PostId</code> and <code>UserId</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>pub type PostId { PostId(Int) }
pub type UserId { UserId(Int) }
</code></pre>
<p>Now the two id types are successfully disjoint, but as a consequence we'll end up with a lot more duplicated code. We'll have to have separate <code>next</code> methods to increment each id type, similarly if we want to unwrap the type we'll need separate <code>to_int</code> functions, and the story is the same for <code>to_string</code>, and so on...</p>
<p>Really, the underlying representation of an <code>Id</code> stays the same no matter how we use it. Instead, we'd like the context an <code>Id</code> is used in to determine whether it is valid or not.</p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type Id(a) {
    Id(Int)
}

pub fn new () -&gt; Id(a) {
    Id(0)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We've now redefined our <code>Id</code> type to include a type parameter, <code>a</code>, but notice how that parameter isn't used in the type's constructor: this is where the name <strong>phantom type</strong> comes from. The second  thing to notice is that our <code>new</code> function returns an id with that generic <code>a</code> parameter. This lets <em>callers of the function</em> determine what the type of <code>a</code> should be.</p>
<pre><code>let foo: Id(String)      = new()
let bar: Id(Float)       = new()
let baz: Id(Option(Int)) = new()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code> are all incompatible with each other. We couldn't check them for equality, for example, because the types don't match up. Fundamental to phantom types is the fact that there is no runtime component, <code>foo</code> may be annotated as <code>Id(String)</code> but no such string exists at runtime, the same for <code>Id(Float)</code> or any other parameter. </p>
<pre><code>foo == bar // Uh oh, compile error!
</code></pre>
<p>This is powerful because we gain the ability to tell the compiler a fact about a particular <code>Id</code>, and the compiler will do extra work to ensure we don't make any mistakes.</p>
<pre><code>pub type User {
    User(id: Id(User), name: String)
}

pub type Post {
    Post(id: Id(Post), content: String)
}

pub fn upvote_post (user_id: Id(User), post_id: Id(Post)) -&gt; Nil {
    // Get a post from the database and upvote it.
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the snippet above, we've defined <code>User</code> and <code>Post</code> types and parameterised the <code>Id</code> type accordingly. Knowing what we know so far about phantom types, we can see that the new type signature for <code>upvote_post</code> will prevent us from accidentally swapping the order of the ids.</p>
<pre><code>let user = User(id: new(), name: "pd-andy")
let post = Post(id: new(), content: "Phantom Types in Gleam...")

upvote_post(post.id, user.id) // Uh oh, compile error!
</code></pre>
<p>Even though our phantom type lets us specialise the <code>Id</code> type, we can still write functions that work on <em>all</em> ids by leaving the type parameter as a variable.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn show (id: Id(a)) -&gt; String {
    let Id(n) = id
    int.to_string(n)
}

show(user.id)
show(post.id)
</code></pre>
<p>The ability to restrict or open up functions to different <code>Id</code>s is where a lot of the power with phantom types comes from. </p>
<h2 id="example-two-handling-money">Example Two: Handling money.</h2>
<p>Let's consider another scenario. We want to build an application that can handle monetary transactions such that we can easily work with currencies of the same type, but different currencies must be explicitly converted via an exchange rate before they can be used together.</p>
<p>Similar to our id scenario, the underlying representation for a value of currency is always the same.</p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type Currency(a) {
  Currency(Float)
}

pub fn from_float (x: Float) -&gt; Currency(a) {
  Currency(x)
}
</code></pre>
<p>As before, our <code>Currency</code> type has a single type parameter that we'll use to <em>tag</em> values with a particular type of currency. We also need to define some types to act as our currency tags. Because these types are only used for annotations, we'll make them opaque. </p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type USD { USD }
pub opaque type GBP { GBP }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use everything we've defined so far to create some different currencies.</p>
<pre><code>let dollars: Currency(USD) = from_float(2.50)
let pennies: Currency(GBP) = from_float(0.55)
</code></pre>
<p>Right now we have some currency values, but we can't do a whole lot with them. While they're wrapped up in our <code>Currency</code> type, we can't use any arithmetic operators or pass these values to functions expecting <code>Float</code>s.</p>
<p>Let's remedy that by writing two functions, <code>update</code> and <code>combine</code>. We'll use <code>update</code> to apply a function to the value wrapped by a <code>Currency</code>, and we'll use <code>combine</code> to apply a function to two <code>Currency</code> values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For other data structures these functions might be called <code>map</code> and <code>map2</code>. These imply the type can change, for example <code>list.map</code> can be used to turn a <code>List(a)</code> into a <code>List(b)</code>. </p>
<p>Because we want to preserve the type (so we can't convert <code>Currency(USD)</code> to <code>Currency(GBP)</code>) we give these functions different names so there aren't any mismatched expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>pub fn update (a: Currency(a), f: fn (Float) -&gt; Float) -&gt; Currency(a) {
  let Currency(x) = a
  x |&gt; f |&gt; from_float
}

pub fn combine (a: Currency(a), b: Currency(a), f: fn (Float, Float) -&gt; Float) -&gt; Currency(a) {
    let Currency(x) = a
    let Currency(y) = b
    f(x, y) |&gt; from_float
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the type parameter for <code>Currency</code> doesn't change (these function take a <code>Currency(a)</code> and return a <code>Currency(a)</code>), they can't change the tag of any currency passed in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Both <code>update</code> and <code>combine</code> are examples of <strong>higher-order functions</strong>.  That is, they are functions that take <em>other functions</em> as one of their arguments (or return a new function themselves).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use these two functions to define some more functions so we can actually <em>do</em> things with currency values, like doubling something or adding two currencies together.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn double (a: Currency(a)) -&gt; Currency(a) {
    update(a, fn (x) { x * 2 })
}

pub fn add (a: Currency(a), b: Currency(a)) -&gt; Currency(a) {
    combine(a, b, fn (x, y) { x + y })
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can call these functions with any type of currency, but for something like <code>add</code> we get compile-time safety that ensures we only add two currencies of the same type.</p>
<pre><code>double(dollars)       //=&gt; from_float(5.00): Currency(USD)
add(pennies, pennies) //=&gt; from_float(1.10): Currency(GBP)

add(dollars, pennies) //=&gt; I won't compile!
</code></pre>
<p>But what if we <em>want</em> to add two currencies together? To do that we need a way of converting one currency to another with an exchange rate. We can use phantom types again here to define an</p>
<p><code>Exchange</code> type that describes the exchange rate from one currency to another.</p>
<pre><code>pub opaque type Exchange (from, to) {
    Exchange(Float)
}

pub fn exchange_rate (r: Float) -&gt; Exchange(from, to) {
    Exchange(r)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, just like we did for currencies, we can define an exchange rate to go from <code>GBP</code> to <code>USD</code> (and vice versa).</p>
<pre><code>let gbp_to_usd: Exchange(GBP, USD) = exchange_rate(1.41)
let usd_to_gbp: Exchange(USD, GBP) = exchange_rate(0.71)
</code></pre>
<p>Using everything we know about phantom types, we can define a <code>convert</code> function that is type safe; we'll never be able to pass in the wrong exchange rate because all the phantom types have to match up!</p>
<pre><code>pub fn convert (a: Currency(from), e: Exchange(from, to)) -&gt; Currency(to) {
    let Currency(x) = a
    let Exchange(r) = e
    x *. r |&gt; from_float
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although our module provided the <code>USD</code> and <code>GBP</code> types to act as currency tags, the functions we've written are general to all currencies but retain their type safety. If consumers of the module want to define another type of currency, they can do that and our functions will still work.</p>

<p>So far the two examples we have seen in <code>Id</code> and <code>Currency</code> have been used to provide a general API across types …</p></div></div>

Luckily an el-rando, now friend, saw that I was in need and reached out:</p><blockquote>"Heading camping to Stradbroke week after next if you want to totally unplug. <strong>If you need anything, let me know</strong>."</blockquote><p>I just want to say, thank-you. I needed that. </p><p>Dear reader, if you ever find yourself in crisis or a situation similar to mine please do not hesitate to <a href="https://ghuntley.com/contact">contact me</a> if you need a shoulder or advice. You deserve to live a life that makes you happy and not miserable.</p><p>People often ask me what got you interested in #vanlife, now you know. It wasn't an interest as-per-say but more of a necessity and a key ingredient to ensuring my children would grow up with a father in their lives. </p><p>I first heard about the concept of #vanlife back in 2015 after reading this article about a <a href="https://jalopnik.com/google-software-engineer-lives-in-a-van-to-avoid-san-fr-1737619550">Google employee who lived in a box-truck in the company's parking lot</a>:</p><blockquote>“I realized I was paying an exorbitant amount of money for the apartment I was staying in — and I was almost never home,” he says. “It’s really hard to justify throwing that kind of money away.

A large part of that is due to some early advice I received from a man who had also recently divorced:</p><blockquote>It will all work out. Just keep the focus on the kids and relationship will improve. We're at the stage where my ex will come around and have drinks with my girlfriend and I.

            <p>Welcome to the third part of this series aimed to help you unleash a power never seen on Earth using the Almighty Vim. If you don’t understand what’s happening in this article, I recommend you to read the previous ones of the series first:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/">Vim for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-intermediate/">Vim for intermediate users</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll see together in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some nice keystrokes beginning with <code>g</code>.</li>
<li>What ranges are and how to use them.</li>
<li>The quickfix list and the location lists.</li>
<li>The marvelous substitute command.</li>
<li>The crazy useful <code>:global</code> (or <code>:g</code>) command.</li>
<li>What marks are and what you can do with them.</li>
<li>How to increase and decrease numbers with a single keystroke.</li>
<li>How to sort text with a nice command.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before going into the juicy content of this article, I’ve some recommendations for you, dear reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire up your Vim and play around with the commands and keystrokes while reading. It’s the best way for you to remember everything which blew you away. You’ll then be able to be blown away whenever you like for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Don’t use a cheatsheet; write your own as you read. It will allow you to come back easily to the commands you find the most useful for <em>your own needs</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enough rambling. Let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="useful-g-keystrokes">Useful “g” Keystrokes</h2>
<p>Let’s begin gently with a mixed bag of keystrokes starting with <code>g</code>. There are many of these “g” commands in Vim, and we already saw some of them in the previous articles. Can you recall them?</p>
<p>You can use these keystrokes in NORMAL mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gf</code> - Edit the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>CTRL+W CTRL+F</code> to open the file in a new window.</li>
<li>It can open the URL under your cursor if you have the plugin <code>netrw</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gx</code> - Open the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
<ul>
<li>It will use the default application used by your OS for this filetype.</li>
<li>It works with URLs too. It will open your favorite browser and load the website.</li>
<li>It only works if you have the plugin <code>netrw</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gi</code> - Move to the last insertion you did and switch to INSERT mode.
<ul>
<li>Pretty useful if you stopped your editing to look at some other file.</li>
<li>It uses marks under the hood: more on that later in this article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gv</code> - Start VISUAL mode and use the selection made during the last VISUAL mode.</li>
<li><code>gn</code> - Select the match of your last search:
<ol>
<li>Move to the last searched match.</li>
<li>Switch to VISUAL mode (if you weren’t in VISUAL mode already).</li>
<li>Select the match.</li>
<li>You can continue to hit <code>n</code> (or <code>gn</code>) to select the area between the current match and the next match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>gI</code> - Insert text at the beginning of the line, no matter what the first characters are.
<ul>
<li>The keystroke <code>I</code> insert text <em>just before the first non-blank characters</em> of the line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To try out <code>gf</code> and <code>gx</code>, you can write for example <code>https://www.google.com/</code> in Vim, place your cursor on it, and hit the keystrokes. Don’t forget the trailing slash in your URL.</p>
<p>You’ll soon discover an inconvenience with <code>gx</code>: when you use it on a filepath, Vim will hang till you close the file. That’s why I’ve created the following mapping you can add to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>nnoremap gX :silent :execute
            \ "!xdg-open" expand('%:p:h') . "/" . expand("&lt;cfile&gt;") " &amp;"&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre><p>It maps the keystroke <code>gX</code> to use <code>xdg-open</code>  with the filepath under your cursor. It will open the file with your favorite application <em>in the background</em>. The program <code>xdg-open</code> will only work on Linux-based systems; for MacOS, try <code>open</code> instead.</p>


  




    





  





<h2 id="ranges">Ranges</h2>
<p>Now that we’re done with the appetizers, let’s discover the first real dish of our Vim feast: the ranges. You can apply them to many commands, making them terribly powerful.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>In Vim’s help, every command accepting a range will have the string of characters <code>[range]</code> in front of them. Multiple line specifiers are possible, separated by commas <code>,</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the most interesting ranges you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;number&gt;</code> - Any number <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> in your range refers to a line number.</li>
<li><code>.</code> - Represent the current line (often the default range).</li>
<li><code>$</code> - Represent the last line of the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>%</code> - Represent the entire file (same as <code>1,$</code>).</li>
<li><code>*</code> - Use the last selection you’ve made during the last VISUAL mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, using the command <code>:d</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:1,40d</code> - Delete line 1 to 40 included.</li>
<li><code>:2,$d</code> - Delete every line from the second one till the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>:.,$d</code> - Delete every line from the current one till the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>:%d</code> - Delete every line.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also do some arithmetic with ranges if you want. For example, let’s imagine your cursor is on the line 60: the range <code>.,.+10</code> will be equivalent to the range <code>60,70</code>.</p>
<h3 id="visual-mode-and-range">Visual Mode and Range</h3>
<p>If you switch to COMMAND-LINE mode after doing some selection in VISUAL mode, you’ll see these two symbols appearing: <code>'&lt;</code> and <code>'&gt;</code> with a comma <code>,</code> in between. This is a range too!</p>
<p>The symbols <code>'&lt;</code> represents the first line you’ve selected and <code>'&gt;</code> the last line. Each of these are marks; again, we’ll see more about marks below.</p>
<p>In practice, the ranges <code>'&lt;,'&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are synonym, but you’ll have more flexibility with the first. For example, you can execute a command from the first line you’ve selected till the end of the file with the range <code>'&lt;,$</code>.</p>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help [range]</code></li>
<li><code>:help v_:</code></li>
<li><code>:help '&lt;</code></li>
<li><code>:help '&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h2 id="vims-quickfix-and-location-list">Vim’s Quickfix And Location List</h2>
<p>Now, let’s talk about a very useful data structure available in Vim, the quickfix list.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the quickfix list and the quickfix window: these are two different entities. The first is a data structure, the second can display this data structure.</p>
<h3 id="quickfix-lists">Quickfix Lists</h3>
<p>You can think of a quickfix list as a set of positions in one or multiple files.</p>
<h4 id="basics-1">Basics</h4>
<p>Let’s take an example: what happens if you run the command <code>:vimgrep hello *</code>?</p>
<ol>
<li>It will search the pattern “hello” in every file of your working directory.</li>
<li>It will populate a quickfix list with every position matching your pattern “hello”.</li>
<li>It will move your cursor to the first position of the quickfix list.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know more about vimgrep and other tools you can search with, I <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-search-find-replace/">wrote an article about that</a>. Other commands (like <code>:make</code> or <code>:grep</code>) also populate automatically a quickfix list.</p>
<p>Let’s expand the mystery around marks: these positions in the quickfix list are in fact hidden mark!</p>
<p>The quickfix list is often used to display specific errors in a codebase, often spit out from a compiler or a linter (via the command <code>:make</code> for example), but not only, as we just saw. I call the entries of a quickfix list “positions” to be more general, but sometimes Vim’s help will refer to them as “errors”. Don’t be confused: it’s the same idea.</p>
<p>Among other conditions, a quickfix list entry needs to have a filename for you to be able to jump to its position. Otherwise, the entry doesn’t point to anything. Difficult to move to anything.</p>
<h4 id="useful-commands">Useful Commands</h4>
<p>Here are the commands you can use to navigate through the current quickfix list:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cl</code> or <code>:clist</code> - Display all valid entries of the current quickfix list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).</li>
<li><code>:cc &lt;number&gt;</code> - Move to the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>th entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cnext</code> or <code>:cn</code> - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cprevious</code> or <code>:cp</code> - Move to the previous entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cfirst</code> or <code>:cfir</code> - Move to the first entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:clast</code> or <code>:clas</code> - Move to the last entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are additional commands which make quickfix lists really powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cdo &lt;cmd&gt;</code> - Execute a command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code> on each valid entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cexpr &lt;expr&gt;</code> or <code>:cex &lt;expr&gt;</code> - Create a quickfix list using the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>:caddexpr &lt;expr&gt;</code> or <code>:cadde &lt;expr&gt;</code> - Appends the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> to the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have no clue how to use the last two commands, you can do for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cex []</code> - Empty the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cex system("&lt;cmd&gt;")</code> - Populate your quickfix list with any shell command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code>. You can try it with <code>ls</code> for example.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-quickfix-window">The Quickfix Window</h3>
<p>What about displaying the current quickfix list in a new buffer? You can do that with the following command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:copen</code> or <code>:cope</code> - Open a window (with a special buffer) to show the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only have one quickfix window open. To move to the position of the selected entry of the quickfix list in the quickfix window, hit <code>ENTER</code> or <code>.cc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="location-lists">Location Lists</h3>
<p>A location list is similar to a quickfix list, except that the first is local to a window and the second is global to your Vim instance. In other words, you can have multiple location lists available at the same time (one per window open), but you can only have access to one quickfix list.</p>
<p>The commands for location lists are similar to the ones for the quickfix lists; often, you’ll only have to replace the first <code>c</code> (qui<code>c</code>fix) of the command with <code>l</code> (<code>l</code>ocation).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:lli</code> or <code>:llist</code> - Display all valid entries of the current location list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).</li>
<li><code>:ll &lt;number&gt;</code> - Move to the entry <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> of the current location list.</li>
<li><code>:lnext</code> or <code>:lne</code> - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>To populate your location list you can also use the commands <code>:lvimgrep</code> or <code>:lmake</code> for example.</p>
<p>Often, Vim users will use the quickfix list for anything related to errors in their codebase, and the location list for search results. But it’s up to you at the end of the day. With Vim, you’re the master of your destiny.</p>

This feeling of chronic stress that does not subside is rising not just in healthcare professions, but across all types of professions. </span></p><p id="viewer-1kaiu"><span>What often goes unmentioned is that in psychology everything is a spectrum. The difference between someone who is chronically stressed and the person that is burnt out is only in the eye of the clinician. Many people are living with levels of stress that are unhealthy but are not burnt out. </span></p><p id="viewer-1bqdh"><span>Just because someone is functioning at a somewhat normal level does not mean that they should not concern themselves with mental and physical health optimization. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-71nul"><span>We could all get a little better at optimizing our lifestyles to support our human needs. Many of us have a hard time accepting this humanness. Yet like sleep, our need for mental rest and purpose is real and does not go away. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-biii1"><span>I notice a lot of talk about self-care and the need for the individual person to care for their needs. But I would like to draw attention to the fact that burnout and chronic stress are typically environmental. Meaning that burnout is more often caused by the work environment and not by an individual’s self-care routine. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-9m3qv"><span>According to scientists from Berkeley and Rutgers, burnout has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246546370_Making_a_significant_difference_with_burnout_interventions_Researcher_and_practitioner_collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>six main causes</span></a>:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-da98q"><p>Unsustainable workload</p></li><li id="viewer-doq1a"><p>Perceived lack of control</p></li><li id="viewer-55t14"><p>Insufficient rewards for effort</p></li><li id="viewer-a9okm"><p>Lack of a supportive community</p></li><li id="viewer-c9lj4"><p>Lack of fairness</p></li><li id="viewer-6an1q"><p>Mismatched values and skills</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-auilq"><span>Many of these causes are difficult to address without organization-wide changes. The opportunity for intervention that may be the most beneficial is in “perceived lack of control”.</span></p><p id="viewer-5utp4"><span>As many of you know who attended my webinar, perception is everything in psychology. And we can shift even our physiological response to stress by shifting our perception. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-4qp9i"><span>So as you start this week, I encourage you to try to shift your thinking around your tasks from, “what do I have to do today?” To: </span></p><p id="viewer-7fjsn"><span><strong>“What am I choosing to do today?”</strong>

</span></p><p id="viewer-7vbjj"><span>Because in reality, almost all the things we do are choices. We do not have to do anything. We file our taxes because we don’t want to go to jail. We make dinner because we want to feed our families well. </span></p><p id="viewer-7lokk"><span>We have so many choices in life and we do the things we choose. Remembering that they are choices is key. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614422600466/jQNaSzTr-.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I've been a long-time Calendly user and I love how much time it saves me. But I needed a few features that were only available in their premium plans.</p>
<p>Instead of upgrading, I decided to build my own version of Calendly. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a> for the UI and APIs by Google Calendar and Zoom to build this.</p>
<p>You can build this too by following the steps below. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.appsmith.com/applications/600186605b452f525458d6d2/pages/600186605b452f525458d6d4">Click here to try mine.</a> Block my time for a live demo 😬</p>
<h2 id="connecting-google-calendar">Connecting Google Calendar</h2>
<p>First, we need to set up an API that can fetch calendar events from my Google Calendar.  I specifically needed to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/list">list events</a> endpoint. This endpoint is authenticated using OAuth so I also had to grab a <code>refresh token</code> to access my calendar. Ideally, this is done by authenticating the user using the app but because other users need to see <em>my calendar</em>, we'll hardcode this.</p>
<p>To grab a <code>refresh token</code>, you have to create an app in your google cloud console and generate a set of OAuth credentials with a client Id and secret. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Follow <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en">these steps to generate the client ID</a> and come back to the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You have to then obtain an authorization code by visiting this URL with the client Id and redirect URI (can be any URI. I used <a href="https://app.appsmith.com/applications" target="_blank">app.appsmith.com/applications</a>).</p>
<pre><code><span>https:</span>/<span>/accounts.google.com/o</span><span>/oauth2/v</span>2/auth?client_id=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;<span>https:</span>/<span>/app.appsmith.com/applications</span>&gt;&amp;scope=<span>https:</span>/<span>/www.googleapis.com/auth</span><span>/calendar&amp;access_type=offline&amp;prompt=consent</span>
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You will be prompted to grant your google app permission to view and modify your calendar. (You don't need to wait for Google to approve your OAuth app, you can simply use the unapproved version since we're building a personal tool).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once you grant the permission, it will redirect to the URL you provided with a code parameter. This is your authorization code which you can use to generate your refresh token</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>YOUR_REDIRECT_URI</span>&gt;</span>?code=<span>&lt;<span>AUTH_CODE</span>&gt;</span>&amp;scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
</code></pre><p>Taking the authorization code, I generated my refresh token using the following curl</p>
<pre><code>curl --location --request POST <span>'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'</span> \
--header <span>'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'code=&lt;YOUR_AUTH_CODE&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'redirect_uri=https://app.appsmith.com/applications'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_id=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_secret=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'grant_type=authorization_code'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'</span>
</code></pre><p>This request responds with an Access token &amp; a Refresh token but the Refresh token is all we really need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fetching-calendar-events">Fetching Calendar Events</h2>
<p>Now we have a token to talk to our calendar, the next step is to create an Appsmith app and fetch all the calendar events.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for <a target="_blank" href="https://app.appsmith.com/user/signup?">Appsmith</a></li>
<li><p>We first need to create an API to generate Access Tokens using the Refresh token we received from the previous CURL. Use the CURL importer and REST client and then replace our Refresh token in the API client.</p>
<pre><code>curl --location --request POST <span>'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token'</span> \
--header <span>'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'refresh_token=&lt;YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_id=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'client_secret=&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&gt;'</span> \
--<span>data</span>-urlencode <span>'grant_type=refresh_token'</span>
</code></pre><p>Let's name this API refresh_token and hit run to fetch a new access token.
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/t33z88sj2jlyfouqlu32.gif"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Configure the refresh_token API to run onPageLoad in the API settings so that we always have a fresh access_token whenever the page is accessed.

</li>
<li><p>We then configure an API to fetch events from our calendar and call it fetch_calendar_events. </p>
<pre><code>curl --location --request GET <span>'https</span>:
--header <span>'Authorization</span>: Bearer &lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;'
</code></pre><p>We don't want to hard code the value of the access token because it expires fairly quickly and we also want the start and end times to be dynamic depending on the current time. To do this, we'll use Javascript and moment.js, both of which can be used in Appsmith by writing '{{ }}' in any field. Use this to reference the value of the <code>access_token</code> returned by our <code>refresh_token</code> API and also use <code>moment.js</code> to configure the default value of the start and end times. The following are the javascript snippets I used in my API.</p>
<pre><code>{{<span>refresh_token</span><span>.data</span><span>.access_token</span>}} 
{{<span>moment</span>()<span>.format</span>(<span>"YYYY-MM-DDT00:mm:ss+05:30"</span>)}} 
{{<span>moment</span>()<span>.add</span>(<span>1</span>,<span>"days"</span>)<span>.format</span>(<span>"YYYY-MM-DDT00:mm:ss+05:30"</span>)}} 
</code></pre><p>Replace the placeholders with the above js snippets and hit run to fetch your calendar events!
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/wdmxk3d4mex0bx4sbqif.gif"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="displaying-free-slots">Displaying Free Slots</h2>
<p>Once we have the events from our calendars, we need to build out a UI to display these events. Appsmith has a simply DnD interface to build UI. We can use the Table to display our events, a date picker to select which day we should fetch events for, and a dropdown to select the duration of the meeting we'd like our users to schedule. My UI looks <a target="_blank" href="https://app.appsmith.com/applications/600186605b452f525458d6d2/pages/600186605b452f525458d6d4">like this</a> but you can get creative and built something that feels intuitive to you. Be sure to name your widgets well. The naming I'm following in this post is</p>
<ul>
<li>durationDropdown</li>
<li>slotDatePicker</li>
<li>eventsTable
With an idea of the layout and inputs we need, we can configure our Table to display the events our API is returning using javascript. <code>{{fetch_calendar_events.data.items}}</code>
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xgugvgiw145ppqbuetpk.png" alt="Alt Text">
No surprise our table doesn't look very readable because APIs are rarely built to work with views out of the box! Now with a little Javascript we can transform the ugly API response into something human-readable and add some logic to show us the free slots instead of the calendar event. The following code goes into the table data property of the <code>eventsTable</code>.<pre><code>{{
<span><span>function</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
<span>let</span> bookings = fetch_calendar_events.data.items;
<span>let</span> bookingIndex = <span>0</span>;
<span>const</span> startHour = <span>10</span>;
<span>const</span> endHour = <span>20</span>;
<span>let</span> startingTime = moment(slotDatePicker.selectedDate, <span>"DD/MM/YYYY"</span>);
startingTime.hour(startHour);
startingTime.minutes(<span>0</span>);
<span>const</span> hr = startingTime.hour();
<span>let</span> slots = [];
<span>const</span> slotDuration = <span>Number</span>(durationDropdown.selectedOptionValue);
<span>while</span> (startingTime.hour() &lt; endHour) {
  <span>if</span> (startingTime.isBefore(moment())) {
    startingTime = moment();
    <span>if</span> (startingTime.minutes() &gt; <span>30</span>) {
      startingTime.minutes(<span>0</span>);
      startingTime.hour(startingTime.hour() + <span>1</span>);
    } <span>else</span> startingTime.minutes(<span>30</span>);
  }
  <span>const</span> booking = bookings[bookingIndex];
  <span>let</span> bookingStart = <span>undefined</span>;
  <span>if</span> (booking) {
    bookingStart = moment(booking.start.dateTime);
  } <span>else</span> {
    bookingStart = moment(DatePicker1.selectedDate, <span>"DD/MM/YYYY"</span>);
    bookingStart.hour(endHour);
    bookingStart.minutes(<span>0</span>);
  }
  <span>const</span> slotNum = <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.round(moment.duration(bookingStart.diff(startingTime)).asMinutes()) / slotDuration);
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; slotNum; i++) {
    <span>const</span> slotStartTime = startingTime.format(<span>"HH:mm"</span>);
    startingTime.add(slotDuration, <span>"minutes"</span>);
    <span>const</span> slotEndTime = startingTime.format(<span>"HH:mm"</span>);
    slots.push({
      <span>startTime</span>: slotStartTime,
      <span>endTime</span>: slotEndTime
    });
  }
  startingTime = booking ? moment(booking.end.dateTime) : startingTime.hour(endHour);
  bookingIndex += <span>1</span>;
}
<span>return</span> slots.map(<span>(<span>slot</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> {
    <span>slot</span>: slot.startTime + <span>" - "</span> + slot.endTime
  }
})
}()
}}
</code></pre>The above logic was really the hardest part of building this application and took the longest to get right (but that was also the most fun part). The code declares a self-invoking function that iterates over the response of the <code>fetch_calendar_events</code> API and adds free time slots to an array <code>slots</code> that is returned by the function. It begins iterating from 10 am to 8 pm (again hardcoding my workday for convenience 😬) and makes use of the value in the <code>durationDropdown</code> to determine the number of free slots of selected duration that can fit between the current available time and the next calendar event.<pre><code><span>const</span> slotNum = <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.round(moment.duration(bookingStart.diff(startingTime)).asMinutes()) / slotDuration);
</code></pre>It then skips to the end of the next busy calendar event and continues this till it reaches the end of my workday!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-calendar-events">Creating Calendar Events</h2>
<p>To schedule a meeting, we can create a button on the table and configure it to open a modal once it is clicked. The modal UI can also be custom-built using DnD to capture a user's name, email, and purpose of the meeting. </p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ozi01s0vdum84jd4olk7.gif"></p>
<p>Name the inputs as <code>nameInput</code>, <code>emailInput</code> and <code>purposeInput</code> so we're able to use them in our API. Let's import the following CURL and name the API create_event</p>
<pre><code>curl 



    "<span>start</span><span>": {
        "</span>dateTime<span>": "</span>&lt;START_TIME&gt;<span>"
    },
    "</span><span>end</span><span>": {
        "</span>dateTime<span>": "</span>&lt;END_TIME&gt;<span>"
    },
    "</span>description<span>": "</span>&lt;DESCRIPTION&gt;<span>",
    "</span>summary<span>": "</span>&lt;TITLE&gt;<span>",
    "</span>attendees<span>": [{ "</span>email<span>": "</span>&lt;EMAIL&gt;<span>" }]
}'</span>
</code></pre><p>In the above API we need to accept dynamic values from our app, so we need to replace some of the params and headers. Below is the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code> with <code>{{refresh_token.data.access_token}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>USER_NAME</code> with <code>{{nameInput.text}}</code>, 
-<code>START_TIME</code> with <code>{{moment(slotDatePicker.selectedDate+" "+eventsTavble.selectedRow.slot.split(" - ")[0], "DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm").toISOString()}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>END_TIME</code> with <code>{{moment(slotDatePicker.selectedDate+" "+eventsTavble.selectedRow.slot.split(" - ")[1], "DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm").toISOString()}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>DESCRIPTION</code> with <code>{{purposeInput.text}}</code>, </li>
<li><code>TITLE</code> with <code>{{nameInput.text + " Meeting with Nikhil"}}</code> and finally</li>
<li><code>EMAIL</code> with <code>{{emailInput.text + " Meeting with Nikhil"}}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, our API is reading values from the <code>eventsTable</code> and the <code>slotDatePicker</code> to create the right event for the selected slot (<code>eventsTable.selectedRow</code>). We can now bind the onClick of the confirm button to call the <code>create_event</code> API and close the modal onSuccess.

<p>Finally I needed it to send out a Zoom link for every event so I integrated with Zoom's APIs and created a zoom link for my calendar events. (This is one of the things I love about Calendly)
To integrate with zoom, we have to fetch a JWT to authenticate our application requests with zoom. I followed <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/auth/jwt">this guide</a>.
With a JWT in hand, it became as easy as importing another CURL and naming it create_zoom</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>My backup tool <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> stores backups in a repository as an evergrowing set of
encrypted data trees which use content addressing and structural sharing
to deduplicate data. In order to delete unused backups we need to do something very similar to how
many programming languages free unreferenced memory - garbage collection. This post will
explain the evolution and implementation of the garbage collector in bupstash for the curious.</p>
<h2 id="stop-mark-and-sweep">Stop, mark and sweep.</h2>
<p>The initial version of the bupstash garbage collector was a naive stop-the-world
garbage collector. It walks all backup data trees creating a set of reachable data chunks
by address and then deletes unreachable data.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Mark.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>lock_repository()
reachable_addresses = empty_set()

for data_tree in all_backups():
  
  work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
  
  until work_list.is_empty():
    
    node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
    reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
    
    if node_height != 0:
      add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><p>This algorithm is short and sweet, but if the repository is very large our repository becomes unavailable
for a potentially long time. The next version shortens the downtime of the repository significantly.</p>
<h2 id="mark-stop-mark-and-sweep">Mark, stop, mark and sweep.</h2>
<p>The bupstash v0.6.4 garbage collector takes advantage of two facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because many backups share data with each other, we can memoize the walk phase to skip work.</li>
<li>Because backups are immutable while the repository is unlocked, we can walk most of them without
stopping the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time we walk the repository without the repository locked, then lock it and walk
the repository again using our memoization to quickly complete the job. If any new backups
appeared during our first walk, we are guaranteed to mark them now that the repository lock is held. Doing the majority of the slow mark phase without locking the repository greatly increases
the repository availability for other operations.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>walked_trees = empty_set()
reachable_addresses = empty_set()

func walk_repository():

  for data_tree in all_backups():

    if walked_trees.has(data_tree):
      continue

    walked_trees.add(data_tree)
    
    work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
    
    until work_list.is_empty():
      
      node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
      already_walked = reachable_addresses.has(node_address)
      reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
      
      if node_height != 0 and not already_walked:
        add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

walk_repository()
lock_repository()
walk_repository()

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><h2 id="mark-stop-mark-bloom-adjust-and-sweep">Mark, stop, mark, bloom adjust, and sweep</h2>
<p>The next version of the garbage collector is a WIP unreleased version.</p>
<p>In bupstash each data chunk address is 32 bytes, which means we need at least 32 bytes of RAM per chunk in the repository to successfully perform a garbage collection. For a repository containing a 100 million chunks or
more this could easily exhaust memory on a busy or small system.</p>
<p>If we are willing to accept a very low probability of retaining some extra data, we can reduce this down
to a few <em>bits</em> per chunk reducing memory usage by 64x or more.
To do this we use a probabilistic data structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a> to track reachable addresses.</p>
<p>Bloom filters have two downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can have false positives. For us this means we might keep a data chunk by accident we could have actually freed.</li>
<li>We must presize them. They cannot grow if we got the size wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily for us these downsides are not bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because memory use is so low per address, we can generously size our bloom filter reducing false positives to less than one percent, even for large repositories.</li>
<li>We can easily detect when a bloom filter gets overly full and produces many false positives, and thus adjust it’s size for future garbage collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, the bupstash implementation of a bloom filter is actually simpler than a hash table, with the implemenation
weighing in at around 30 lines of code plus tests and helpers.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memoized mark repository.</li>
<li>Stop the world.</li>
<li>Memoized mark the repository.</li>
<li>Adjust bloom filter size.</li>
<li>Sweep.</li>
<li>Restart the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code>walked_trees = empty_set()
walked_addresses = empty_cache()
reachable_addresses = empty_bloom_filter(repository_bloom_size())

func walk_repository():

  for data_tree in all_backups():

    if walked_trees.has(data_tree):
      continue

    walked_trees.add(data_tree)
    work_list = new_work_list_from_backup(data_tree.root_address)
    
    until work_list.is_empty():
      
      node_height, node_address = work_list.pop()
      already_walked = walked_addresses.has(node_address)
      reachable_addresses.add(node_address)
      walked_addresses.add(node_address)
      
      if node_height != 0 and not already_walked:
        add_child_nodes_to_worklist(work_list, node_address)

walk_repository()
lock_repository()
walk_repository()

if bloom_filter_overutilized(reachable_addresses):
  increase_bloom_filter_size_for_next_gc()
else if bloom_filter_underutilized(reachable_addresses):
  decrease_bloom_filter_size_for_next_gc()

for chunk_address in repository:
  if not reachable_addresses.has(chunk_address):
    delete_chunk(chunk_address)

unlock_repository()
</code></pre><p>One thing to note about this implementation is that because the bloom filter has false positives we can not use it to skip processing addresses, instead
we must introduce a new cache for this purpose. A cache also lets us put a fixed upper bound on memory usage for large repositories.</p>
<p>Overall for large repositories, the addition of a bloom filter reduces ram requirements from the gigabyte range down to tens of megabytes while increasing the repository size by only a fraction of a percent.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector tries hard to keep the repository avaliable as long
as possible while also providing excellent performance with a small memory profile. If you are implementing
a content addressed storage system, this post will hopefully provide you with some new ideas.</p>
<p>In the future bupstash could follow the same path as programming language garbage collectors to find more improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallelism in the mark phase.</li>
<li>Parallelism in the sweep phase.</li>
<li>Incremental collection.</li>
<li>Object generations.</li>
<li>Write barriers</li>
<li>Yet to be invented techniques…</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s a story that’s becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>You’re smack dab in the middle of harvest and an error code appears on your combine’s monitor. A call to the dealership results in a long wait for a technician to come out, with anxiety rising with every passing hour because priceless harvesting time is being lost or, worse, nasty weather is moving in.</p>
<p>Then when the technician gets to your farm, he determines what is needed is to reset (or ‘flash’) the onboard computer.</p>
<p>That happened to Cole Siegle last fall when he was harvesting canola, leaving the Fairview-area producer to wonder why he can’t have access to the same diagnostic tools.</p>
<div id="attachment_133445"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>Cole Siegle.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>“If I could have done that myself or been able to use a mechanic or a technician who’s closer to me, our downtime could have gone from six hours to two hours,” he said. “That four hours could have been the difference between getting&nbsp;a crop off before the snow or not.”</p>
<p>But these days it’s dealerships — via sales and service agreements with manufacturers — that have legal access to these diagnostic tools. So when an error message pops up, farmers and independent mechanics are out in the cold, sometimes literally.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Read more: <a href="https://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/news/remote-diagnostics-blocked-by-poor-internet-on-farms/">Remote diagnostics blocked by poor internet on farms</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>“As a producer I think we need access to these diagnostic tools,” said Siegle. “If (manufacturers) want to continue to build equipment like this that’s fine, but we need access to the laptops with the programs that we can plug into our equipment so we can buy whatever part we need.”</p>
<p>Equipment manufacturers make a lot of repair information public, including what codes mean, but giving access to proprietary tools raises several issues, said John Schmeiser, CEO of the Western Equipment Dealers Association.</p>
<p>The hardware and software Siegle and other farmers wish to acquire for repair purposes can also be used to modify equipment to the detriment of machinery, warranties, the lawfulness of their operations and even their own safety, he said.</p>
<p>“I applaud the manufacturers that put a lot of stuff online&nbsp;like parts, service manuals and operational guides. But it’s a slippery slope,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“When you provide special tools to somebody outside a controlled environment like the manufacturer/dealer&nbsp;relationship, that opens the door for illegal modification. They lose that control when they provide&nbsp;diagnostic or special tools to a third-party retailer with whom they don’t have the same sales and services agreement.”</p>
<h2>Repair versus modify</h2>
<p>‘Right to repair’ is a term being thrown around a lot in ag circles today, but it means different things to different people.</p>
<p>For Siegle and other like-minded producers, it means the right to either repair equipment themselves or hire an unaffiliated local mechanic — just as farmers have done throughout the history of mechanized agriculture.</p>
<div id="attachment_133446"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>John Schmeiser.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>But Schmeiser argues that farmers’ right to repair is already entrenched in law in many jurisdictions (including Alberta) as long as the owner is using the equipment for its intended purpose and doesn’t violate manufacturer standards.</p>
<p>The right to repair (R2R) movement (which started in the tech sphere but expanded to other areas, such as ag equipment) is actually a front for promoting the ‘right to modify,’ he said.</p>
<p>Often that means making modifications to bypass environmental controls in order to boost vehicle horsepower.</p>

<p>“There are over 25 states that had R2R bills introduced — every one impacting farm equipment has been defeated,” said Schmeiser. “They haven’t passed&nbsp;because as the state representatives were hearing the rationale coming from R2R advocates, they were finding out that what they were really looking for is to modify the equipment in a manner where&nbsp;it can get around emission standards and violate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laws and regulations.”</p>
<h2>DEF delete and chipping</h2>
<p>There are two specific actions that concern Schmeiser’s association (a Missouri-based advocacy group for equipment dealerships with a Canadian headquarters in Calgary).</p>
<p>One is circumventing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (or DEF) emissions systems using grey-market ‘DEF delete’ kits to boost horsepower on tractors and combines. Another is ‘chipping’ or ‘tuning,’ which usually refers to adding a specific chip to increase horsepower.</p>
<p>Bypassing emissions control systems contravenes the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, leaving producers open to fines, said Schmeiser, adding he was unsure of the Canadian penalties but breaches of similar U.S. laws have produced fines in excess of $300,000.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that not everyone knows this practice is illegal. Another is it comes with a host of potential risks including damaged equipment, voided warranties, reduced trade-in value, insurance cancellation and even safety, he said.</p>
<p>“We have seen an unusual number of combine fires this (past) year,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“Now, we have had some dry conditions but in some of those cases the combines were running hotter (due to alterations).</p>

<p>“The insurance company will look at it from the standpoint that you have altered your combine away from the manufacturer’s original standards and you are going to be denied insurance coverage in a situation like that.”</p>
<p>But Siegle isn’t convinced.</p>
<p>He said he has no interest in making such modifications to his equipment and suggested it’s a straw man argument from manufacturing and dealership interests seeking exclusive control over the diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>The kind of modification Siegle is concerned about losing is the legal ability to place, for example, a third-party manufacturer’s custom header on a John Deere combine. Specifically, he worries about big manufacturers denying third-party companies the codes required for an implement to interact with a tractor or combine.</p>
<p>Schmeiser said this isn’t considered modification but rather interoperability or connectivity: A third party designing an implement to attach to another manufacturer’s product. This is a long-standing tradition in the manufacturing and dealership industries that few if anyone has any interest in ceasing, he said (see accompanying story).</p>
<h2>The business aspect</h2>
<p>All of this still does not answer Siegle’s fundamental question: Why can’t I — or mechanics unaffiliated with specific manufacturers — have all the tools required to diagnose and fix a mechanical problem?</p>
<p>In the past it was relatively easy for mechanically minded producers and unaffiliated mechanics to repair machinery because it ran on tried-and-traditional engineering principles. This is still by and large the case, said Schmeiser, adding 95 per cent of equipment issues can still be fixed mechanically.</p>
<p>He said he understands the frustration farmers feel by not having diagnostic tools at their fingertips. But at the same time dealerships have rights as well, especially when one considers the considerable training and expense needed to obtain service contracts with manufacturers.</p>
<p>“What the farmer is speaking to is the frustration of being down. He wants to get up and running as quickly as possible. We get that,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“But the moment the manufacturers start providing special tools or diagnostics&nbsp;equipment to businesses that are outside of their dealer contracts, doesn’t that diminish the value of the contract in the dealer’s eyes as well?… So what’s the incentive for the manufacturer&nbsp;to provide special tools or even service manuals to a third party that would be competing with somebody they have a contractual relationship with&nbsp;(and) who is also making a substantial financial investment to be the representative for the manufacturer?”</p> </div>

February 26, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>

</code></pre></div><p>In addition to the obvious call to <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>, we have
some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function
epilogue</a>),
and then return to our caller with <code>retq</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a different example. Suppose that we want to print
an uppercased C string and we’d like to avoid heap allocations for
smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15

use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi

      <p><span>Greenwashing is when a company pretends to be </span><b>eco-friendly</b><span> despite using toxic ingredients and unsustainable practices to manufacture their product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When a company engages in </span><i><span>greenwashing</span></i><span>, they effectively influence consumers to believe that they’re working towards saving the environment when they’re not. In fact, companies that go to great lengths to create a </span><b>greenwashed marketing strategy</b><span> are sometimes covering up their lack of </span>environmentally friendly products or processes<span>. They are interested only in improving their sales and making more money, and they do so by projecting a green image and deceiving </span><b>conscious consumers</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It should be noted that some companies greenwash their products accidentally. Misinformation surrounding sustainability is so widespread that companies can get the wrong idea about what's sustainable and what's not. Although there's no excuse for large corporations with hefty research budgets, smaller companies sometimes think they're being eco-friendly when they're not.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Why do companies use this marketing strategy?</b></h2>
<p><span>The short answer is that companies who deliberately use this strategy do so to attract more customers and increase revenue.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Over the past couple of decades, there has been a shift toward holding companies accountable for their carbon footprint and environmental impact. At the same time, consumers have become more conscious of their impact on the environment. Naturally, conscious customers try their best to buy </span><b>environmentally friendly products</b><span> when possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There isn’t currently a lot of regulation around sustainable terms such as: natural, green, eco-friendly, and environmentally friendly. Any company can include green colors and imagery on their products and use terms such as </span><i><span>natural</span></i><span>. Therefore, it’s usually easy for brands to attract well-meaning consumers and improve their sales. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another reason for companies using this marketing strategy is to stand out from their competitors in the market. They promise the consumers that their product is more efficient, saves more power, or is </span><b>sustainable</b><span>. In response, many people start purchasing from them believing that they are helping the environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many companies see this </span><i><span>green agenda</span></i><span> as an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage, especially because “natural products” are usually priced higher.&nbsp;Particularly when shopping on-the-go at the grocery store or mall, consumers don’t have time to research every single product they put into their cart. And with good reason! Unless you only buy from trusted brands, it’s hard to distinguish between the truly sustainable products and the fake ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Examples of Greenwashing</b><b><br></b><span><br></span><span>A very common example of greenwashing is when a company rebrands as natural or eco-friendly. If a company changes their name, logo, or slogan to appear greener without actually changing their business to be environmentally friendly, then chances are it's an attempt to greenwash. Food companies, cosmetic companies, and household product manufacturers are often seen involved in greenwashing. &nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another example of greenwashing is when a company labels its products with buzz-words and meaningless statistics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever seen one or more of the the following descriptions on a product?<br></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>"99% naturally derived"&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><span>"100% recyclable"</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>"Made with natural ingredients"&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span>"Biodegradable"&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>While these things all sound great to the conscious consumer, these phrases don't mean anything.</p>
<p>Single-use plastic can be 100% recyclable, but it isn't sustainable or eco-friendly. Many chemicals are naturally-derived, yet are still harmful to the environment. Food, cosmetics, textiles, and more can all be made with "natural" ingredients, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're inherently healthy or environmentally friendly. Lastly, most things are biodegradable, but that doesn't mean it's okay to dump them in a landfill.</p>

<h2><b>Impact of Greenwashing</b></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/pexels-catherine-sheila-2409025_480x480.jpg?v=1613572719" alt="false green claims"></p>
<p><b></b><span>Greenwashing is unethical.&nbsp;False green claims have&nbsp;a negative impact not only on consumers but also on the environment. Let’s look at some of the problems that arise because of greenwashing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Encourages Uninformed Decisions</b> <b><br></b><b><br></b><span>The most important danger of greenwashing is that it misinforms people, leading them to make wrong decisions and contribute to unintended environmental harm. Customers, without knowing if a company’s eco-friendly claims are genuine or not, act unsustainably, and make an uninformed decision. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><b>Harms the Environment</b></p>
<p><a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.118-a246"><span>Greenwashing harms the environment and public health</span></a><span>. When consumers are unable to understand the false practices of a company and they decide to buy from a greenwashing company, they contribute to the growth of that company.</span></p>
<p><span>Their support gives such companies more revenue and they continue with their greenwashed marketing and non-environmentally friendly products. Many companies that use greenwashing are often found to be using toxic ingredients in their products or using unsustainable practices such as excess water usage, causing unnecessary air pollution,&nbsp;or producing toxic run-off. To stop this, consumers should look into what they are buying and support the company only if they are genuinely working towards protecting the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Harms Genuine Brands</b><b><br></b><b><br></b><span>Apart from harming the environment, greenwashing also causes trouble for companies that are genuinely working towards saving the environment. This happens because greenwashing breaks consumer trust and consumers start suspecting </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> brands</span><b>, </b><span>even those that are working hard to produce </span><b>environmentally friendly products</b><span>. The reputation of true eco-friendly companies are hindered, making it difficult for them to gain significant market share.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>How to Identify Greenwashing&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/Webp.net-resizeimage_3_480x480.jpg?v=1613572793" alt="greenwashed" width="480x480" height="480x480"></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it can be hard to know if a company is greenwashing or not.&nbsp;It is important for consumers to be educated and aware about which companies and products are truly green and which are not, but this takes time and a lot of effort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, there are some things you can look out for that might help you make more informed decisions. Here are a few tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Many companies use specific phrases like natural, sustainable, organic, healthy, vegan, etc. to attract consumers. The use of such words gives the impression that they are eco-friendly and green. However, be skeptical. You should read the information provided by the company on the packaging material, label, and website. The only way to know about the product is to read the label carefully.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li>
<span>You should know what common products are inherently not eco-friendly: PVC, triclosan, microbeads, aerosols, phosphates, and chlorine bleach are just a few toxic materials that companies use while still marketing themselves as safe and natural. </span><span></span>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<span>Product imagery that depicts natural scenery is also a tool used by many companies to deceive potential buyers. Consumers should be aware not to be fooled by pictures of fruit, nuts, farms, or any other natural-looking imagery on the labels of the product. Using a particular image does not represent the true sustainability of a company’s products.</span><span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Besides using earth-centered imagery, companies also using earthy tones to promote a natural vibe. They use greens, browns, and blues instead of bright and flashy colors while packaging their products. This is to lure the consumers who are drawn to earth-friendly products. However, consumers should remember that greens and browns don’t necessarily imply that the product is earth-friendly.</span><span><br></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Ways to Verify Sustainable Brands&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><b><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/4346/4271/files/MG_1114_copy_480x480.jpg?v=1613568843" alt="what is greenwashing"></b></p>
<p><span>These days, the number of environmentally-conscious buyers is growing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you find it hard to obtain information about a company’s factory or production details, there's a chance&nbsp;that the company is greenwashing or it has something to hide.To verify the sustainability of a brand,&nbsp;you&nbsp;should try to find out more and more about the way a company operates. <p>Here are some things you can look out for:</p></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Don't trust everything that a company shares or says if they don't have evidence to back it up. There is a possibility that the company is sugar-coating their information or spinning the truth.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Try to find out about the company’s supply chain, their production facilities, the employees, working conditions, contractors, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Evaluate the logistics of the product. If a company is claiming they're sustainable, but they're still using single-use plastics...you know something is off.&nbsp;Look for the trademarks of true sustainability such as zero waste practices and/or materials.</span></li>
<li><span>For textiles and household goods, check the material and quality of the product. For food and cosmetic products, check the ingredients and learn more about the production processes of common ingredients. For example, "palm oil" sounds relatively unproblematic, but is actually one of the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/8-things-know-about-palm-oil">greatest&nbsp;drivers of deforestation</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Ask tough questions! Even true eco-friendly companies are not perfect, but they'll be happy to answer your questions and show you how they're willing to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you really want to avoid giving business to companies who are&nbsp;intentionally greenwashing, you'll need to screen your purchases carefully. Keep an eye out for harmful ingredients, materials, and production practices. When you're informed, you can spot fake eco-friendly companies much more easily.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<p><span>Continue to read labels and always think about the entire product lifecycle - all the way from the sourcing of materials all the way down to&nbsp;discarding, recycling, or reusing the product.</span></p>
<p><span>Greenwashing needs to be stopped and we need to hold companies accountable. Let’s continue to do our part by becoming conscious consumers and buying environment friendly products.</span></p>

<p>When you and your friends put your fingers on the ouija board planchette and it starts moving around, there's a chance your friends are just yanking your chain – but just as possible is that your friends are experiencing the ideomotor response.</p>
<p>That's when your unconscious mind directs your muscles without your conscious knowledge. The movement of the planchette doesn't tell you what's going on in the spirit world, but it does tell you something about the internal weather of your friend's psyche, fears and hopes.</p>
<p>Our narratives are social-scale planchettes, directed by mass ideomotor response. When a fake news story takes hold, it reveals a true fact: namely, the shared, internal models of how the world really works.</p>
<p>Fake news is an oracle, in other words.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2019/07/cory-doctorow-fake-news-is-an-oracle/">https://locusmag.com/2019/07/cory-doctorow-fake-news-is-an-oracle/</a></p>
<p>There's no spirit-realm directing planchettes. Supernatural phenomena are nonsense, in all their guises. Mediums are fraudsters or deluded – and so are soothsayers who claim to be able to predict the future. That goes for fortune-tellers and futurists alike.</p>
<p>A shocking number of self-described "rational" science fiction writers share the delusional view that they can predict the future. These pulp Nostradamii point to "predictions" of sf that have "come true" and claim to have an inside line on the world of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sf <em>has</em> an important relationship to the future, though! It can be a planchette: all the futures imagined by all the sf writers are a kind of mutation-space, and the fitness factor that determines whether a story thrives or sinks is whether it captures public imagination.</p>
<p>Sf writers and readers are a means for society to reflect back, amplify and examine our unarticulated hopes and fears about our <em>present</em> technology. Sf doesn't predict the future, but sf readers and writers do an excellent job of predicting the present.</p>
<p>And since the present is the standing wave where the past is being transformed into the future, knowing about the present can be a source of insights into what's coming – and not just because sf reveals what's going on in the present, but also because it influences it.</p>
<p>People who are captured by imaginative, futuristic parables about the problems and possibilities of technology acquire a set of intuition-pumps for coping with the future when it arrives, reflexive views and actions about what the future demands of us.</p>
<p>Gene Rodenberry didn't predict the Motorola flip-phone. Rather, when a generation of Motorola designers and engineers were asked to make a mobile communications device their minds immediately flew to the Star Trek communicators they grew up with.</p>
<p>Thinking of fantastic fiction as measurement device and influence machine is a productive way to pick apart the meaning of literary trends.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my intro to the bicentennial re-release of FRANKENSTEIN, the rise and fall of Shelley's book tracks to the rise and fall of fears related to the book's various themes:</p>
<p><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1974387">https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1974387</a></p>
<p>So what are we to make of K-zombies? Korean pop culture is experiencing a golden age of zombie movies, games, comics and other media.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-23/zombies-are-everywhere-south-korea-fears">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-02-23/zombies-are-everywhere-south-korea-fears</a></p>
<p>Zombies have a lot of different themes, of course, and some are easy to map to the current situation: the fear of contagion and the need to distance yourself from loved ones who have become infected. The parallels to covid hardly need explaining.</p>
<p>But the K-zombie phenomenon predates the pandemic, and zombie stories aren't merely contagion stories – they're often stories about the lurking bestiality of nearly everyone around us.</p>
<p>That's behind stories like The Walking Dead, about the propensity of all our "normal" friends and neighbors to transform into an insensate, rampaging mob. These zombie stories are a throwback to the "cozy catastrophes" of John Wyndham and co:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/29/grifters-gonna-grift/#wyndhamesque">https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/29/grifters-gonna-grift/#wyndhamesque</a></p>
<p>These are stories of racial and class anxiety, of xenophobia and the literal othering of someone who <em>seems</em> to be just like you but is actually a secret monster. Again, on a divided peninsula, it's not hard to see how stories of lurking otherness would catch hold.</p>
<p>Zombie stories are also stories about the fragility of social cohesion: stories about how we're never "all in this together" and how, when the chips are down, it'll be "the war of all against all." That, too, feels very zeitgeisty given recent South Korean politics.</p>
<p>South Korea has an ugly, authoritarian past that is at odds with its founding myth as the "good Korea," the "democratic Korea." But the post-war reconstruction of the country by the US elevated an elite to a position of near-total authority and impunity.</p>
<p>They abused this power in ghastly ways, running forced-labor camps for poor people and people with disabilities, with rampant physical and sexual abuse. Families who lost their loved ones were traumatized to learn that they'd ended up in the camps.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131643/https://bigstory.ap.org/article/c22de3a565fe4e85a0508bbbd72c3c1b/ap-s-korea-covered-mass-abuse-killings-vagrants">https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131643/https://bigstory.ap.org/article/c22de3a565fe4e85a0508bbbd72c3c1b/ap-s-korea-covered-mass-abuse-killings-vagrants</a></p>
<p>These forced-labor camps (which continue in a slightly modified form to this day) supplied slaves to chaebols, the conglomerates that represent the country on a world stage. Unsurprisingly, the leadership of these companies is also grossly corrupt:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2052871/samsung-chief-jailed-for-2-5-years-over-corruption-scandal">https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2052871/samsung-chief-jailed-for-2-5-years-over-corruption-scandal</a></p>
<p>Korea is also riven by messianic cults, and the leaders of these cults have close ties to the Korean political class, an incredibly politically destabilizing fact that has caused recent Korean governments to collapse:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085</a></p>
<p>South Korea, in other words, isn't just haunted by the spectre of aggression from the north – but also by the possibility of internal rupture. It has a huge, authoritarian secret police force that has been caught secretly meddling in electoral politics.</p>
<p>Far from reining in this spookocracy, the South Korean political class has tried to hand them even MORE powers, with LESS oversight. Today is the fifth anniversary of the Korean opposition's filibuster to stop the worst of these.</p>
<p>(Seo Ki-Ho, a politician with the affectionate nickname "Milhouse" for his resemblance to the Simpsons character read the Korean edition of my novel LITTLE BROTHER into the record during the filibuster!)</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/CcHHpWmUMAAyJk-1.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/CcHHpWmUMAAyJk-1.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>This othering is also sharply illustrated in the country's culture of misogynistic voyeurism, which goes beyond "upskirt" videos and includes a roaring trade in videos captured with hidden cameras in toilets, changing rooms and hotel rooms.</p>
<p>It's hard to overstate the reach of this practice, and its political salience: it has provoked a vast mass-movement of women and allies demanding an end to the practice and a reckoning with institutional sexism:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.khaosodenglish.com/culture/net/2020/10/21/voyeurs-are-selling-photos-of-women-at-the-protest-online/">https://www.khaosodenglish.com/culture/net/2020/10/21/voyeurs-are-selling-photos-of-women-at-the-protest-online/</a></p>
<p>Zombies aren't ever just about contagion – they're also always an expression of a deep anxiety that your neighbors aren't what they seem, that in a pinch, they'll turn on you, and not just because they've been infected, but also to protect themselves and their comfort.</p>
<p>US zombie booms always have an element of this: 1950s (reds under the bed); 1980s (red menace redux); 2000s (immigration "crisis"), etc. It'd be amazing if the only thing driving K-zombies' popularity was the pandemic, or even less plausibly, a mere aesthetic coincidence.</p>

<p>When all you have is market orthodoxy, everything looks like a market failure. Take privacy: giant, rapacious corporations have instrumented the digital and physical worlds to spy on us all the time, so some people think they should pay us for our data.</p>
<p>There's a pretty rich theoretical history explaining why this "data dividend" is a stupid idea. First of all, private information isn't very property-like. And not  just because it shares all the problems of digital works (infinitely, instantaneously copyable at zero cost).</p>
<p>Private information makes for bad "property" because it is "owned" by multiple, overlapping parties who generally disagree about when and who to share it with. When you and I have a conversation, we both own the fact that the conversation took place.</p>
<p>What happens if I won't sell, but you will? Tech companies are <em>really</em> good at finding the cheapest seller of an information good, after all. For example, whenever you visit a "quality newspaper's" site, there's a real-time auction to bid on the right to show you ads.</p>
<p>Say there are 13 bidders for that right. One gets to show you an ad, but the other 12 get something too: your unique identifier and the fact that you read, say, the New York Times.</p>
<p>That fact is then sold on to garbage chumbox sites like Tabouleh, whose pitch to advertisers is "I can show your ads to NYT readers at 15% of the price that the Times charges." If the same fact is "owned" by lots of people, it's a commodity.</p>
<p>Buyers will find the lowest, least-discerning seller. What's more, you can't solve this by requiring consensus of all "owners" of a fact before it is disclosed – who owns the fact that your boss sexually harassed you: you or him? Does he get a veto over your disclosures?</p>
<p>Even if we could get property rights to work in privacy (which, for the record, we cannot), all we'd manage to do is transform privacy into a luxury good wherein poor people are coerced into selling their data for pennies, as Malavika Jayaram reminds us:</p>

<p>TL;DR: It’s possible to mine Ethereum on a M1 Mac GPU. Hashrate is about 2Mh/s.</p>

<p>I’ve had my M1 MacBook Air for a bit of time now, and I also recently started mining Ethereum. I can’t help asking myself: What’s Ethereum mining performance like on a M1 Mac?</p>



<p>The obvious thing to do first is to run the off-the-shelf <code>ethminer</code>, which gives the following error:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-alpha.0
Build: darwin/release/appleclang

Unrecognized platform Apple
Error: No usable mining devices found</code></pre>



<p>Not good. Apparently Apple GPUs are not whitelisted in ethminer. That should be easy to fix. Relevant lines are in <code>libethash-cl/CLMiner.cpp</code>, and I added Apple GPUs to the whitelist, pretending it’s an Intel GPU.</p>



<p>Then <code>boost</code> won’t compile since it’s trying to compile with a <code>-fcoalesce-templates</code> argument, which doesn’t exist in recent clang versions. So I have to update <code>boost</code> to the latest version, and fix relevant <code>asio</code> code since <code>ethminer</code> was using deprecated <code>asio</code> APIs.</p>



<p>I also need to upgrade OpenSSL to the latest version to have it support darwin + arm64.</p>



<p>After getting everything to compile. Here’s the result:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-17+commit.ce52c740.dirty

<h2>Is it worth it?</h2>



<p>Um. Not really. At current Ethereum prices (2021-02-26), it generates $0.14 of profit per day. It’s still a profit, but very miniscule.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://laurencemolloy.github.io/RepoDash/"><strong>github.io pages</strong></a> 
for detailed instructions on how to use RepoDash.</p>



<p>Do you maintain a project codebase on Github? Would you like to be able to collate statistics 
that summarise historic monthly activity on that codebase and see, at a glance, how that impacts 
the project issues list over time? Would you like to be able to perform this analysis for any 
given time period of your choosing?</p>

<p>RepoDash can do just this. It uses the Github API to collect repository data and generate a 
data visualisation of a range of historic metrics of the project issues list over a user-specified 
period of time. For each calendar month in the time period of interest, it displays the following 
metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of new issues created</li>
<li>How many of these issues are still open at the time of generating the dashboard</li>
<li>How many of these issues still require triage (labelling) at the time of generating the dashboard</li>
<li>The number of existing issues resolved</li>
<li>The percentage split between opened / closed issues</li>
<li>The aggregate number of open issues in the issues list (month start &amp; month end)</li>
<li>The aggregate number of open issues in the issues list requiring triage (month start &amp; month end)</li>
<li>The change in total number of open issues over the month</li>
<li>The average age and age spread of open issues in the isssues list</li>
</ul>


<p>It also displays aggregate counts for the most frequently used labels for all issues that remained open
at the end of the displayed time period.</p>

<h3>Typical Use Cases</h3>

<p>Perhaps you are managing an open source project, the maintenance of which you'd like to keep on top 
of. Or perhaps you manage a software product at work where you are required to provide your boss with 
exective summary updates of your support team's progress on an ongoing monthly basis. Either way, if 
your codebase is managed via Github, RepoDash could be just what you need.</p>

<h3>Demo Mode</h3>

<p>For demo purposes, this code processes the first 10 pages of the matplotlib<sup>1</sup> project and 
displays the most recent 12 months of metrics by default. Command line arguments allow you to set your
own project repository and analysis timeframe. It couldn't be simpler.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><strong>matplotlib</strong></a> is a popular open science 
plotting library for python which is utilised by RepoDash to generate its data visualisations</em></p>

<h3>Future Development</h3>

<p>This project is a work in progress. The current version of RepoDash has only been tested with open 
source (public) projects. However, there are plans to ensure that it works with private ones as well. 
Over time, we also plan to build on the range of metrics offered and make it easy for the user to select 
which metrics to display... watch this space!</p>

        <p>Over-fitting is a lie.</p>

<h2 id="backgroud">Backgroud</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://drorcohengithub.github.io/website/decoding/encoding/fmri/2020/07/31/decoding_visual_experience.html">previously talked about</a> predicting and decoding brain activity as recorded using fMRI. In that post I followed the tried and true approach of (1) extracting some features from the stimulus and (2) fitting a regularised linear regression from the features to brain activity. It works really well.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we use linear regression in these type of “encoding” studies is that there is not much data. For example in that study the training set had only about 7200 samples (which is quite a lot by fMRI community standards). The traditional thinking is that very rich models, such as deep neural nets (NNs) with millions of parameters, will disastrously over-fit in this type of situation, resulting in low performance. However, this traditional thinking may be out of date.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293878v1">recent paper uploaded to bioarxiv</a> generated some discussion in our lab. It is a very thorough study looking at predicting brain activity using deep NNs with many interesting results. Among these results, the authors show that replacing the linear regression with a NN provides a substantial improvement over linear regression (see also <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00021/full">here</a>).</p>

<p>I think is pretty likely that with some effort and a lot of NN know-how an expert can improve on the performance of a linear model. But I figured that avoiding over-fitting in this situation is going to be really hard, and that an out of the box implementation would perform disastrously. So I thought I’d give it a go.</p>

<p>In this post I go through fitting a simple NN, though still with millions of parameters, to predict brain activity. I’ll use a vanilla NN paired with the same data I analyzed in my previous post. This way we will have a direct comparison with the linear model. A full notebook to reproduce this is up on my <a href="https://github.com/drorcohengithub/Prediciting_BOLD_with_TensorFlow">github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>

<p>We will use the same data from last time. For convenience I put everything you’ll need <a href="https://figshare.com/s/9803543b6736009e7a83">here</a>.</p>

  <li><strong>ME_features_train_data</strong> this is the ME feature data we will use to train the model.

  <li><strong>linear_model_acc</strong> this is the accuracy data for the linear model. This is calculated as the pearsons correlation between the model predictions and the test data (i.e. voxel_test_data)</li>
</ul>

<p>I restrict the analysis to the 2000 voxels that were best predicted using the linear model. This is a bit harsh on our NN here because it is possible that the NN improves on voxels that the linear model was poor at predicting, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>

<p>We first need to decide on the structure of the network. There is now a whole zoo of network architectures and I think it is pretty likely that many of them are superior to the linear model. However, the point here to see how well an “out of the box” NN works. Nothing is more vanilla than a tutorial, so I will use the architecture from the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression">TensorFlow regression tutorial</a>. The architecture has two hidden, densely connected layers with relu activations. We will be fitting a mere 1,812,304 parameters.</p>

<p>There really is no reason to think that this architecture is suited to our specific problem. But if something like this <em>does</em> work, then it may not be so difficult to come up with a NN that is superior to the linear model.</p>

<p>To the model.</p>

<p>The next thing is to choose an optimizer for the network. The tutorial used ADAM with a hardwired learning rate, but I went with a simple weight decay approach. Standard stuff, though I did manually tweak it a bit. A more principled approach is to optimize this using cross validation or something but for simplicity I’ll keep this as is.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-the-training-and-validation-data">Prepare the training and validation data</h2>

<p>I will keep some data aside for validation as we train the model. The key thing to remember here is that we are using time series data. This means that the data is not iid. If we just grabbed samples randomly for validation then there is a good chance that dependent samples will be in the training set. For example, we may end up with sample at t=n in the val set but t=n-1 in the training set. These are dependent, and in fact likely to be quite similar. In this case performance on the validation test will reflect something of double dipping and probably be much higher than what we get on the final test set.</p>

<p>I will very crudely grab three chunks of 200 samples at intervals of 2000, 4000 and 6000 samples. This is completely arbitrary and pretty poor practice. We did much better on the ridge regression in the previous post, but I think it is good enough for illustration. Note that we might have a bit of leakage (since the samples around these chunks are still in the training set), but I think it is not too much of a worry.</p>

<p>flatcat invites to experience a new dimension of touch and motion. Cuddle with it, have a gentle romp, or just watch it do weird things on its own, to caress your soul. The robot feels everything exactly with cognitive sensorimotor loops based on ten years of developmental robotics research. flatcat has no face, no app, no cloud, full privacy. It is built around a 3D printed skeleton and is powered by Jetpack Cognition Lab‘s own electrical motor design.</p>



<p>The new product will be available on Kickstarter and selected outlets beginning March 3, 2021. Visit https://flatcat.berlin for more information.</p>
