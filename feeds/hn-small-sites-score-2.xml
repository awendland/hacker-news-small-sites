  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As the fallout of the <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">FSFE stalking scandal continues</a>, we are publishing below the leaked FSFE diversity strategy.</p>

<p>Here are the highlights we identified:</p>

<blockquote><em>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</em></blockquote>

<p>What is the real reason women don't want their name and picture on the FSFE web site?</p>

<blockquote><em>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).</em></blockquote>

<p>FSFE's biggest event is LLW but it is never advertised.  The registration process and the Call for Papers are hidden from the former Fellows and the Supporters.  Women will not participate in other Free Software events as long as the biggest events, like LLW, are hidden in the shadows.</p>

<blockquote><em>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women.</em></blockquote>

<p>Women employed as interns, men employed on permanent contracts.  As the recent court case demonstrates, all women on permanent contracts were <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">sacked for talking about equality</a>.  What Matthias Kirschner describes is analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch">Untermensch concept from the Third Reich</a>.  This isn't the first time <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/matthias-kirschner-fsfe-nazi-comparisons/">we find Kirschner's conduct is close to that of the Third Reich</a>.</p>

 </ul>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Why would <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga Gkotsopoulou</a>, a woman from Greece, want to continue working for Free after her paid German internship ends?  Why would a woman in Greece want to send money to a misogynist in Berlin?  What will this Greek money be used for, hiring more female interns in Kirschner's cramped little office?</p>

<p>Kirschner appears to be delusional about his obligation to pay people.  An internship is a contract that ensures the woman can never acquire maternity rights, the contract always finishes before they can become pregnant.  Women resent this.</p>

<blockquote><em>### In Progress

</em><ul><em>
</em><li><em> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
<ul>
 <li>Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
  <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that)</li>
</ul>
</em></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>This was the only definite action from the strategy, another Code of Conduct.  The way Kirschner <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">went to this woman's home</a> demonstrates the reality of the Code of Conduct: leaders of open source organizations see themselves as God, they can do whatever they want and only apply their "enforcement" venom to their political rivals.</p>

<p>Subject: Re: diversity and expanding the GA<br>
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:51:58 +0000<br>
From: Matthias Kirschner <mk@fsfe.org><br>
To: ga@fsfeurope.org</mk@fsfe.org></p>

<p>Dear GA members,

</p><p>thank you all for raising your points in this thread. As Hugo pointed
out we repeatedly had that discussion, and also worked on some points.
Still there were some new ideas in the thread and from the Council we
suggest a few action items to make further progress. But first, so that
everybody is on the same page, some examples of existing activities on
that topic.,/p&gt;

</p><p>## Some examples of what we already do/did

</p><ul>
<li>When we have pictures on our website we try to have equal wo/man on
 them. For example have a look at
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.en.html (this
 year we had some additions, before IIRC the ratio was better).</li>

<li>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</li>
<li>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).
 Although we have the same problem most conferences have, that is is
 really difficult to achieve that.</li>

<li>For the Legal Network council we started by picking the same ratio
 with men as with women.</li>

<li>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women. One reason is
 also because becoming intern is also increasing the chance to become
 an employment in the Free Software area.
 (https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html says "We want more
 women to be involved in Free Software. That's why we will give
 preference to applications from suitably qualified female
 candidates.")</li>

<li> As with males we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek
   deputy coordinator.</li>
 <li>With <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=lucile+falgueyrac+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Lucile</a> we have regular contact and invite her to meetings (she
   has very little time).</li>
 <li>We work a lot with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Eszter+Bako+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Eszter</a>, who is now assistent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Reda">Julia Reda</a>, but
   it might be difficult to include her further at the moment.</li>
 <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Lusy+Vaseva+fsfe">Lusy</a>
is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul></li>

<li>Staff was following-up with proposals from the past. For example
 Patrick Ohnewein before proposed Sonia Montegiove. Matthias had
 several talks with her and invited her to the FSFE summit. The problem
 is that she is quite shy when speaking English.</li>
<li>This year we had a
moderations workshop for our staff. Before it we
 clarified with the trainer that one of our goals is to enable our
 staff running more inclusive meetings. The workshop was documented in
 the wiki https://wiki.fsfe.org/Internal/Moderation (some permission
 problem at the moment, hope it is soon fixed).</li>
</ul>

<p>## Next Steps</p>

<p>### In Progress</p>

<ul>
<li> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
 <ul>
 <li> Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
 <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>### Possible actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion with Ulrike about the topic. She studied gender studies and
 is very interested in the topic) about the topic. Together with her
 identify strategies for more diversity inside the FSFE community and
 the GA, by</li>
<ul>
<li>having a budget for counselling on diversity (as several
people
   pointed out, just because someone is a women in IT, does not know
   they know about diversity).</li>
<li> have a time budget for Ulrike to
help on this issue next year.</li>

<li> As some hesitate to just add women to the GA without first being
 involved in other areas, make it a priority to support already active
 or interested females (or other under represented groups).  * This
could include that we encourage them to join us in teams, and
   mentor them, or to invite them to events so we can meet them (could
   also include priority for travel funding in case we have to choose).
</li></ul>

<li>GA participation:
<ul><li>You might have realised that all our male
staffers are GA members,
   but none of our female staffers is. That is bad. We should encourage
   Polina and Ulrike to think about joining, too.</li>
 <li>Depending on the outcome of the FSFE2020 discussion: if we enlarge
   the council (as the FSFE board) introduce a quote there (as Daniel
   proposed to have a second VP position, with a requirement that at
   least one of the VP positions must not be male.)</li>
 <li>Depending on the Italian GA member's feedback, we could invite her
   as a guest to the next GA, or if they think it would be a good idea
   we can ask her to first become another coordinator for Italy as a
   first step.</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html starts with a quote by
 a former male and female interns. But we should update one of the
 quotes by Erik or Hugo on that page with former quotes.</li>

<li>Make sure we have balanced quotes by women on our website / as well as
 the front page. E.g.
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.en.html (either
 get more or think about removing this page for next years in the
 campaign)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Matthias</p>

		<div>
			
<p>I am 100% serious with the title, despite the appearance of click-bait. Mastodon has a serious structural rot that is only worsening as time gets on. I think this is for a few reasons which I will outline below.</p>



<p>Ironically, I don’t feel safe posting this directly to the fediverse because of the very forces I’m about to describe. I’m not worried about the cancel crew, I just don’t want to deal with hostile interactions right now. I might link to this post but it’s less likely to get hate mail I suspect if I do it that way rather than write this all up in a giant thread on fedi.</p>



<p>What I am presenting is largely anecdotal opinion, although it has been gathered from countless others (I’m not going to name any names, they deserve better than harassment or people trying to change their views and in the process merely reinforcing them).</p>



<h2>Background on myself</h2>



<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since April 2017. I was on “fedi” (well, the ostatus fediverse) before that, on long-gone instances I forgot the name of. I was on Mastodon in the very early days of its development, when content warnings were brand new, blocking/silencing was seriously broken, and fedi was just getting exciting due to press coverage. Before this, I was on IRC since 2005 and an IRC operator on a small network (it’s not glamorous, trust me).</p>



<h2>The problem</h2>



<p>Fedi has a problem as the title says: it’s crumbling. It’s a lot less vibrant than when I joined up, even back when GNUSocial roamed the earth (it was a pile of shit trying to imitate Twitter and mostly filled with people banned from Twitter for GamerGate and going too far, even for Twitter’s lax standards of the day).</p>



<p>It actually baffles me why so much of the Mastodon userbase can be traced back to the Tumblr/Twitter leftist crowd, when Fedi’s beginnings were on a network largely consisting of ultra-right people thrown off Twitter. I can only speculate, but I suspect the main reasons are they believed they would be safer (which is a joke), and many themselves (or their friends at least) were banned from those platforms for similarly shitty behaviour.</p>



<p>But it’s a mistake to believe that Fedi is safer at all. In fact, in many ways, it’s worse.</p>



<h3>Fedi is the least safe place around</h3>



<p>The thing about Fedi is that due to its nature, it has a low bar to entry. Anyone can make an instance at any time for not a whole lot of money. There are tons of far-right instances littering the place, and few admins can truly keep up (the worst-kept secret amongst Mastodon admins I would say). Most of the userbase just blocks them on an ad-hoc basis and moves on (or doesn’t notice them), but the fact that the Nazis haven’t really taken over the place is only by their mere incompetence.</p>



<p>To illustrate the problem, I will tell you about this: the largest instance on the Fediverse.</p>



<p>Oh, no, not mastodon.social. They’re big, but not as big as the largest. The largest is Pawoo, with around a million users last I checked. It’s owned by Pixiv, a Japanese company (think Japanese DeviantArt). And if Fedi knew even a rudimentary level of Japanese (this would require widespread non-Western cultural awareness they do not possess), they wouldn’t have joined in the first place. Japanese nationalism is everywhere on Pawoo, and the admins largely don’t care (granted: I don’t pay much attention to it and filtered it a long time ago, this may not be the case any longer). There is a certain irony I love about the largest Fedi instance being a commercial entity, despite the English speakers of the Fediverse largely eschewing corporations and brands. They also allow loli and (fictional) artwork of children, which is not banned in Japan but is a grey area in the US as advised by legal counsel for IF (I personally don’t want to test it, if you want to, have fun, leave me out of it).</p>



<p>Pawoo mostly sits there, under the radar, because they don’t speak English, and many instances blocked them a long time ago (I remember the great Pawoo discourse of 2017). There are tons and tons of other instances that most people don’t even know about that spew things that are far worse.  We at mst3k actually have <a href="https://mst3k.interlinked.me/about/more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pretty big list</a>, and it ain’t even close to how many are actually out there. I just block them as I see them. Granted, many of those instances are long-gone, but there are many more to replace them.</p>



<h3>The faux-woke crowd is making fedi less safe</h3>



<p>I know this one is going to get me flamed and called racist or whatever the fuck, but so be it.</p>



<p>Now, full disclosure: I am partially Romani, Native American, but mostly (and certainly culturally raised) white, but <a href="https://weirder.earth/@WeirderAdmin/105640549522292568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve listened to what other PoC have to say on this matter.</a></p>



<p>Fedi has a really bad problem: race-based trolling. There is a huge contingent on Fedi that is taking advantage of white guilt to troll the ever-loving fuck out of people.</p>



<p>I know this sounds like an amusing thing and is very much a “so what, they’re white” moment.  But I assure you, it’s anything but funny, and it’s causing minorities to be shed from Fedi.</p>



<p>Let me give a specific example: in mid-2020, a Jewish non-binary person was harassed by a member of one of the instances that host many of these trolls. People were still reluctant to do the right thing and block the instance, because they didn’t want to be called racist. The thing is, you can be a minority and still be a fucking dickhead, and you can also still be racist (without even realising it!) and act in bigoted ways against other minorities (go look up the Cherokee freedmen controversy for a really, really, really bad look into how far this can go). But nothing about your skin colour or ethnicity says “I can troll whoever I want.” Anyone who tells you otherwise is a troll and you should block and report them. If their admin won’t do anything, remove them.</p>



<p>The thing is, these kinds of games cheapen real racial justice. These people are less interested in racial justice for all and more interested in getting a rise out of people. And people are too afraid to stand up to it. This is a cancer silently driving people back to Twitter. I don’t think it’s the only thing stacked against Fedi, but it’s a huge one.</p>



<h3>The cancel crowd</h3>



<p>I’m going to say it: the canceldon crowd are obnoxious. They’re a holdover from Twitter and Tumblr. I won’t go into the whole “why cancelling is a waste of time” thing, but suffice it to say: cancelling doesn’t really fucking work, and it’s just a nice way of saying “doing what 4chan does to people it hates, but poorly.” Which is to say, harassment and trolling people. And of course people think it’s okay, even when they fuck up and sometimes cancel the wrong person or have bad info or got led on (this is never discussed, of course, and there is never an apology).</p>



<p>These people are literally making Fedi inherently less safe for everyone, and are no better than the crowd that used to be on Fedi (and still are to an extent) before Gargron decided to co-opt the Fediverse for his own gain.</p>



<h3>The people who write the software are fucking dickheads</h3>



<p>I’m going to be honest with you: Gargron (the guy who makes Mastodon) is an asshole. His reputation precedes him, so I won’t go into detail. However, I found out from a former IRL friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that he once asked her if he could continue to refer to her by her dead name. Said friend referred to Gargron as a “shitty liberal,” and I do not mean in the US sense.</p>



<p>The people at Pleroma are not much better. I mean, Alex Gleeson, enough said.</p>



<p>The only two relevant pieces of Fedi software are Pleroma and Mastodon. ActivityPub is such a horrible protocol, and Mastodon has butchered it so much, it’s impossible to make an interoperable implementation without man-months of work. To reimplement Mastodon from the ground up would be a nightmare. And forking Mastodon sounds great, but you’re up against a huge pile of technical debt. You could fork Pleroma, but then you’d have to know Elixir (a language few people know).</p>



<p>Also, the last time a major fork happened in Mastodon (aside from Glitch), it was mostly a group of non-developers who hoped they could cult their way into a dev team. It didn’t work.</p>



<p>I wanted to fix this problem but I decided it wasn’t worth it, and you’d have to be up against a community who is watching your every mistake and will find a reason to pillory you if you fuck up.</p>



<h3>“Mastodon” never developed a culture of its own</h3>



<p>You know, if you leave a container of yoghurt out for 4 years, it develops a culture. That’s more than can be said for the Mastodon part of Fedi, which has never outgrown being an offshoot of Twitter and Tumblr.</p>



<p>This is to its detriment, as it’s not a compelling place on the surface. People come in waves, and most leave again when Twitter and Tumblr rights its wrongs. I’ve seen this happen multiple times.</p>



<p>Mastodon users would do well to stop treating Fedi as Twitter, but of course, Mastodon and Pleroma as platforms basically both treat Fedi as Twitter expanded universe. It’s no coincidence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gargron has joined Twitter’s federation initative.</a> I have no hopes Fedi will develop a meaningful distinct culture before its too late.</p>



<h3>The tools to protect users are rotten fruit in an opaque bag</h3>



<p><em>Note: this was edited in after the fact. I meant to include it in the original.</em></p>



<p>I’m going to say what many admins lack the bravery or vision to say: the tools to protect the users of Mastodon are inadequate. Pleroma got this better, but many Mastodon users cancel any Pleroma user on sight (as I explain below).</p>



<p>The filtering sucks (it displays “filtered” unless you choose to permanently delete any posts containing a keyword). The default guide for setting up ElasticSearch (the thing that enables search) had (may still have for all I know) no mention of using a firewall or listening only on localhost (Gargron pushed back on requests to mention this), which would enable anyone in theory to connect to …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>Brain iron dyshomeostasis with iron accumulation is a known feature of brain aging. 
The cause of this iron accumulation is aging is unknown, but the immune system is less active in older people, and as viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in aging host tissues.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220280/">has been proposed several times</a> that metal dyshomeostasis could be an underlying mechanism responsible for the initiation and progression of the pathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the motor and extra-motor symptoms of ALS.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33491917/">new paper proposes</a> an update of the iron hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease), based on large scale emerging evidence.</p>

<p>Iron featured historically early in Alzheimer's disease research efforts for its involvement in the amyloid and tau proteinopathies, yet iron neurochemistry remains peripheral in mainstream Alzheimer's disease research.</p>

<p>Much of the effort investigating iron in Alzheimer's disease has focused on the potential for iron to provoke the onset of disease, by promoting proteinopathy through increased protein expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation.</p>

<p>The authors provide new evidence from a large post mortem cohort that brain iron levels within the normal range are associated with accelerated ante mortem disease progression in cases with underlying proteinopathic neuropathology.</p>

<p>These results corroborate recent findings that argue for an additional downstream role for iron as an effector of neurodegeneration, acting independently of tau or amyloid pathologies.</p>

<p>The researchers hypothesize that the level of tissue iron is a trait that dictates the probability of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by ferroptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and is genetically and biochemically distinct from other forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses, resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death. Lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death.</p>

<p>A substantial body of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513737/">preclinical evidence and early clinical data</a> has demonstrated that deferoxamine and other iron chelators have strong disease-modifying impacts in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke. Acting by the disease-nonspecific pathway of iron chelation, deferoxamine targets each of these complex diseases via multifactorial mechanisms.</p>

<p>Deferiprone another iron chelator <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Amyotrophic%20Lateral%20Sclerosis&amp;term=chelator&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search">is tested in clinical trials against ALS</a> in France’s Lille CHU hospital.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/12/11/rugpullindex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/12/11/rugpullindex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets' performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>). <strong>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of the
rugpullindex.com website"></p>
<h2 id="why-building-a-data-set-index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2>
<p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set they're offering without knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that's precisely the type of situation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">data set market</a> [3].</p>
<p>I'll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this: 2020's most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at a ratio they deem as the assets' current prices. These users, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the pool incentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/marketmakers.png"></p>
<p>This model has been so successful that there've been days where decentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it's no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>But there's one implication I've been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you'll have noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it's quite difficult even to find data at all. It's not by accident. <strong>Trading data is valuable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market's Performance</h2>
<p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you can now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p>
<p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn't mean you know they're valuable! After all, if ebay.com didn't have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p>
<p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see how many articles they've sold and what each buyer's experience was. It's a simple identity-based rating system.</p>
<p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no working identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sock puppets</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p>
<h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2>
<p>That's where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market's liquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market's liquidity provider shares isn't. The idea behind this is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, the less likely it is for a "rug pull" attack to happen (details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>). By factoring in a pool's relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For users of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on market data.</li>
<li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance on to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>. And finally;</li>
<li>If they're unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet money for a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set's market performance to make an informed decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior results compared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, which makes me excited about working on this project.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2>
<p>I have many ideas for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> and not as much time as I'd like to have. However, my overarching goal is to make the ranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on top of it.</p>
<p>I think that rating assets based on their markets' performance is valuable occupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I'm particularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, but I'm also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I'm eager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you're having fun using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p>

                            <p>This article aims to provide a fair and thorough comparison of the current private messaging apps in terms of their privacy, security, and anonymity†. However, it must be abundantly clear that this post is written by Status (one of the above messengers). We strongly encourage you to verify our sources, do your own due diligence, and correct us if we are wrong.</p><p><em>†For the purposes of simplicity for the average reader, anonymity will be defined as a complete dissociation of one's chat identity and their true identity.</em></p><h2 id="signal"><strong>Signal</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-signal-servers-see">What can Signal servers see?</h3><p>Not much. Your messages, attachments, calls, sender metadata, group chats and group metadata are all end-to-end encrypted. However, Signal (and Amazon) can infer who talks to who with a fair degree of accuracy by analyzing the network traffic. Signal is the only entity that runs the Signal servers, and <a href="https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/">they host all such servers on Amazon Web Services</a>. Here is a simple breakdown of what the network traffic could look like if Alice (1.1.1.1) sent a message to Bob (2.2.2.2):</p><p><strong>08:23:02</strong> — IP Address 1.1.1.1 sends 512 bytes to Signal's server.</p><p><strong>08:23:04</strong> — IP Address 2.2.2.2 receives 512 bytes from Signal's server.</p><p>This is what Jeff Bezos can see. Now, this, on its own, doesn't necessarily mean that Alice is talking to Bob. It could just be a coincidence — Bob happened to receive a different and entirely unrelated packet two seconds after Alice sent one of equal size.</p><p>However, if this coincidence were to happen, ten, twenty or a hundred times, with packets of equal sizes going back and forth from Alice and Bob, it would soon become apparent that these two IP addresses are likely talking to each other. At this point, one simply has to ask the respective Internet Service Provider (such as Comcast or AT&amp;T) who is behind a given IP address to uncover their legal identity.</p><p>So basically, Jeff Bezos can know who you talk to on Signal with a fair degree of accuracy via traffic analysis. This can be done even without Signal's cooperation, as Amazon has direct access to all incoming and outgoing traffic on the centralized Signal servers. In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nj3YFprqAr8?t=2034">acknowledged this flaw in the Q&amp;A session</a> of his 36C3 talk "The ecosystem is moving."</p><p>If Signal were to cooperate in such traffic analysis attacks, it would become much easier, as Signal does have access to the recipient metadata (<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">but not sender metadata</a>). In other words, they can see who the envelope is addressed to, but not who it came from. This, in addition to the traffic analysis, would allow Signal to infer nearly all the sender/recipient metadata, in addition to some of the group metadata.</p><h3 id="is-signal-anonymous">Is Signal anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, Signal will leak your IP address to your contacts that call you by default (you can change this in the settings by enabling the option "Always Relay Calls"). Signal also has the technical capability of associating your IP address and your Signal account (<a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/">but they probably don't do this</a>). This means that even a burner number isn't enough for total anonymity if you assume the Signal servers are malicious or compromised.<br></p><p>It is worth noting that Signal has never claimed to be an anonymous tool. These points do not detract from the fact that they do care about your privacy — they are simply approaching it in a different manner.</p><h3 id="is-signal-easy-to-shut-down">Is Signal easy to shut down?</h3><p>If you don't have any faith in the US government, the answer is yes. If you do, the answer is probably not. Signal is the sole operator of the Signal servers, and they are based in the United States. There is no federation, and there is no peer-to-peer architecture. If Signal is legally compelled to shut down their servers, that's it. All forms of communication through Signal would immediately halt. However, the likelihood of such an event is debatable, and will be left to the reader.</p><p>It would be very difficult to quickly move Signal to a different jurisdiction, as they have thus far operated under the assumption that the US will not ban them. Moxie Marlinspike lives in the US, as does the overwhelming majority of Signal's employees, and their only two legal entities <a href="https://signal.org/legal/">were incorporated in the US</a>. In addition, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Signal themselves could shut down Signal (this may seem obvious, but certain decentralized architectures prevent even the creator of something from shutting it down, such as Bitcoin).</p><hr><h2 id="telegram"><strong>Telegram</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-telegram-servers-see">What can Telegram servers see?</h3><p>Basically everything. They can see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/710344/psa-telegram-chats-arent-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default/">every message you've ever sent in a group chat</a>, most of your 1:1 conversations (not secret chats), all your contacts, your profile picture and your bio. They know who you talk to, and at what time (even if it's a secret chat!). They know the members, name, and icon of every single group (including private ones) .</p><p>This may sound completely contrary to what Telegram says. The reason is that Telegram fundamentally operates on a different trust model. They assume that you trust Telegram, but not the government.</p><p>Telegram splits up their encryption keys and stores the separate pieces in several different jurisdictions. In theory, this means that all of the jurisdictions used by Telegram would have to cooperate in order to obtain any user data. They claim this has allowed them to <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests">not release a single byte of user data</a>. These claims, by their very nature, are unverifiable, and require that you trust Telegram. If that's good enough for you, use Telegram.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-anonymous">Is Telegram anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust Telegram, then Telegram can be anonymous, as you are given the option hide your phone number and use a username of your choice. If you don't trust Telegram, it is not anonymous in any way, as they will have your phone number and <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#5-2-safety-and-security">they can see your IP address</a>.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-easy-to-shut-down">Is Telegram easy to shut down?</h3><p>Probably not. Telegram intentionally set up its legal structure to be agile and resistant to overreaching governments. If Dubai (<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#8-2-telegrams-group-companies">their current jurisdiction</a>) bans them, they would likely move to another. Dubai is a flag of convenience for Telegram. However, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Telegram themselves could shut down Telegram.</p><hr><h2 id="whatsapp"><strong>WhatsApp</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-whatsapp-servers-see">What can WhatsApp servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private group, the group icon, the group name, and which members are the administrators of said group. But your messages, pictures, attachments, status updates and calls are all end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that the end-to-end encryption of WhatsApp messages has been repeatedly compromised through <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/04/whatsapp-backups-android/">unencrypted Google or iCloud backups</a>. Although these backups are technically optionally, they are repeatedly suggested to the user with a coercive user interface. Even if you do not enable these backups, there is a good chance your conversation partner did, which compromises the integrity of the end-to-end encryption for both of you.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-anonymous">Is WhatsApp anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">logs your IP address</a> and directly associates it with your chat identity.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-easy-to-shut-down">Is WhatsApp easy to shut down?</h3><p>Not really, given the scale of Facebook and the nature of public corporations. However, it is very likely that WhatsApp could be forced to include a backdoor into their clients. There would be no way around this, as the clients are all proprietary. With all other messaging apps in this list, one could simply download the code prior to the backdoor, build it, and run that version of the client which still correctly encrypts the messages. Decentralized messaging architectures such as Status or Matrix would be even more resilient against such coercion, as there would be no central servers to shut down.</p><hr><h2 id="matrix"><strong>Matrix</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-federated-matrix-servers-see">What can federated Matrix servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, your private room aliases, your device names, who you talk to, and when.

<p><strong>See also: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1616925913">Flash cards (Anki deck) for memorization</a></strong></p>
<p>My team writes a lot of command line tools, and we like to assume that people aren’t using a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> (meaning: we liberally use colours, italics, and basically every other terminal feature available to us). This tends to result in strings in our code that look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>"\x1b[A\r\x1b[K\x1b[1;32mopened \x1b[1;4;34m%s\x1b[0;1;32m in your browser.\x1b[0m\n"</code></pre>
<p>If you’re like most people, your face just melted, but it’s actually really simple. This page is a crash course in what all of these things mean, and how to learn to read and write them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="x1b"><code>\x1b</code></h3>
<p>ANSI escapes always start with <code>\x1b</code>, or <code>\e</code>, or <code>\033</code>. These are all the same thing: they’re just various ways of inserting the byte 27 into a string. If you look at an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, <code>0x1b</code> is literally called <code>ESC</code>, and this is basically why.</p>
<h3 id="control-sequences">Control sequences</h3>
<p>The majority of these escape codes start with <code>\x1b[</code>. This pair of bytes is referred to as <code>CSI</code>, or “Control Sequence Introducer”. By and large, a control sequence looks like:</p>
<pre><code>0x1B + "[" + &lt;zero or more numbers, separated by ";"&gt; + &lt;a letter&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It’s helpful to think of it this way: the terminating letter is a function name, and the intervening numbers as function arguments, delimited by semicolons rather than the typical commas.</p>
<p>If you see <code>\x1b[0;1;34m</code>, you can read it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[  # call a function
0;1;34 # function arguments (0, 1, 34)
m      # function name</code></pre>
<p>In effect, this is <code>m(0, 1, 34)</code>. Similarly, <code>\x1b[A</code> is just <code>A()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="available-functions">Available functions</h3>
<p>So with that mental model—reading escape sequences as function invocations—here’s an abridged documentation of the “standard library”, as it were:</p>
<table>

<p>For practice, you might try interpreting the following string:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[3A\x1b[4D\x1b[shello\x1b[J\x1b[1;3Hworld\x1b[u\x1b[13T</code></pre>
<h3 id="sgr">SGR</h3>
<p>The SGR (“Select Graphics Rendition”) function (<code>m</code>) has a much more complex signature than the other functions. An—again, abridged—guide to SGR arguments:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Multiple SGR arguments can always be concatenated using another <code>;</code>, and they will be applied in the order they are encountered. It’s especially common to see <code>0;</code> before some other argument, in order to reset the state before applying our own.</p>
<h3 id="colour-palettes">Colour Palettes</h3>
<p>The basic colour palette has 8 entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: black</li>
<li>1: red</li>
<li>2: green</li>
<li>3: yellow</li>
<li>4: blue</li>
<li>5: magenta</li>
<li>6: cyan</li>
<li>7: white</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful way to help remember this, or at least to select colours for use, is that, with the exception of 0/black, the colours are ordered by usefulness, with highest first: red text is very useful for indicating failures, green is useful for indicating extreme success, yellow for warnings, and then blue, magenta, and cyan for progressively more obscure conditions or decoration.</p>
<p>0 and 7 are less useful for text because one or the other will generally look nearly-unreadable depending on whether the user has a light or a dark background.</p>
<p>Terminals will also have a “bright” version of this palette (activated using 90–97 / 100–107). These are the same (black/red/green/etc.) but generally noticeably brighter than their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>For practice, you might try to figure out how this string would display:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[38;2;255;255;0mH\x1b[0;1;3;35me\x1b[95ml\x1b[42ml\x1b[0;41mo\x1b[0m</code></pre>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>Another pair of useful escapes is <code>\x1b[?25h</code> and <code>\x1b[?25l</code>. These show and hide the cursor, respectively. Try not to think too hard about the syntax here: <code>?25</code> means something to do with the cursor and <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> stand for “high” and “low”: imagine a bit indicating whether the cursor should be visible. The “high” value (1) would indicate “show”; the “low” value (0) would indicate “hide”.</p>
<p>Show/hide is useful when you’re going to draw some stuff that’ll cause the cursor to jump around like crazy, for example, repainting a couple of the last few lines to update them with new content.</p>
<p>One other thing that we use frequently is <code>\r</code>, or Carriage Return, which is functionally similar or identical to <code>\x1b[1G</code>. It just moves the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>That was a lot of information, but that’s essentially everything you need to know in order to competently read and write ANSI escape codes in a terminal.</p>

<p>February 2021</p>

<p>Last week’s GameStop (GME) speculative frenzy stirred a motley crew  of Redditors, politicians, and venture capitalists, each using the volatility to push their preferred narratives. <em>Evil hedge funds are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">propping up their buddies</a> and astroturfing misinformation. Market makers are evil for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-puts-spotlight-on-trading-giant-citadel-securities-11612089000">profiting off retail order flow</a>. Robinhood has forsaken its namesake and is in cahoots with the aforementioned parties.</em> There are plenty of villains in this story, or none at all, depending on your view of the financial industry.</p>

<p>The real answer to why Robinhood restricted trading on GME turned out to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/01/business/us-economy-coronavirus#robinhood-needed-3-billion-to-cover-risky-trades-its-chief-told-elon-musk">far more mundane</a>. To recap, settlement of stock trades takes multiple days, and in the meantime, the clearinghouses that facilitate trades for brokers require that some collateral be placed to account for risk that the buyer or seller does not fulfill their side of the trade. Since this risk increases with stock volatility, clearinghouses demanded $3 billion collateral from Robinhood to account for their users holding GME, a meme stock that was routinely seeing +/- 50% swings but threatened to crash to earth at any moment. Robinhood was forced to deal with the imminent liquidity challenge by raising emergency funding. In the meantime, to manage risk, they placed limits on purchasing GME shares. So goes the story recounted by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev (or as Elon Musk called him, “<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184">Vlad the stock impaler</a>”).</p>

<p>Yet this surface-level explanation likely leaves the observant investor with more questions. <em>Okay, so plausibly if we’re trading on margin, Robinhood could face a liquidity crunch. But what’s the problem if we’re trading using our own settled cash?</em> Cash trades need to settle and we have to put down collateral to insure against risk in the meantime. <em>That’s no problem, the internet enables us to process transactions quickly, right?</em> No, it takes two days. <em>Why does it take two days?</em> Transactions are processed at night in batches. <em>Fine then, can’t you use the money we just put up as collateral?</em> You can’t use client funds for that purpose. <em>Why not? Wait, wouldn’t this all be a non-issue if trades cleared near-instantly? Isn’t this a self-imposed problem within the financial industry?</em></p>

<p>Indeed, this doesn’t seem to be how we would design the system from first principles. As it turns out, Robinhood’s liquidity incident only exposes the surface of deeper troubles in fintech. Underneath a world of seamless consumer transacting represented by Robinhood, Venmo, and other apps of their generation lies an underbelly of interconnected financial systems that struggle to meet modern demands. Fintech’s attempts at abstracting away such complexity run into challenges when long-tail events occur, leaving customers frustrated and institutions in danger. A firmer foundational infrastructure from the Fed involving features like open banking, instant P2P payments, and real-time trade settlement (update: <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement">Robinhood themselves called for this now!</a>) would allow us to build a more robust layer of services while minimizing rent-seeking middlemen. <strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-abstractions-fail">When Abstractions Fail</h2>

<p>Software engineers define leaky abstractions as when underlying implementation details of a process, meant to be hidden away, become relevant as things fail. From this perspective, Robinhood manifested <strong>an</strong> <strong>abstraction that was not simply leaking but gushing out from every news report</strong> and flooding investors’ brokerage accounts. By hiding the details of a complex settlement process and marking sale proceeds as immediately available to a customer, Robinhood presents a simplified trading process to customers while handling the settlement and margin details behind the scenes. It all works well until some Redditors decide to send a stock to the moon and your platform bears the brunt, I guess. In any case upon discovery of a software bug, it’s an all-too-familiar experience to realize a certain library call isn’t working, and find yourself having to dig further and further into the annals of ancient source code down the chain to figure out where something went wrong.</p>

<p>Since you were never intended to dig this far (you’d never need to, right?), they sure won’t make it easy to dig down there, with obfuscated binaries, hidden state effects, and other nasty monsters of the underworld. Likewise, delving into the GME situation is a hopeless exercise for an average investor who, faced with a sudden message of “trading suspended”, rationally wants to get to the bottom of this. They would quickly find a wall of opaque financial rules with regards to the clearing process that seem to exist on a “need to know’’ basis. If Vlad the CEO himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M7X2dsW_Xw">“doesn’t quite know how the formula works”</a>, what hope does the average citizen have to track down the source of this seeming bug in the system? Perhaps we should all just give up, raise pitchforks against Citadel, and call it a day.</p>

<p>The financial world is not new to abstractions, of course. Almost any tangible object or collection of intangibles has been securitized, packaged into new securities, tranched once or twice for good measure, and repackaged - repeat until satisfied. New engineered securities are then available for boomer 401k portfolios, sovereign wealth funds, and anyone else who wants in from the peripheries. These abstractions, in their defense, have usually made the markets in which they’re employed <a href="http://www.oeconomia.actapol.net/pub/9_3_181.pdf">far more efficient and liquid</a>. Mortgage-backed securities, as much as they were maligned for their role in precipitating the Great Recession, made it dramatically easier for cash-strapped homebuyers in North Carolina to be matched up with someone on the other side of the world looking to [in theory] buy a bunch of uncorrelated assets (we all know how that ended though) for their investment portfolio. In exchange for the hard work and research that goes into assembling these securities, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/causes-of-wage-stagnation/">financial middlemen wages have shot up dramatically since 1970</a> against a backdrop of broader economic inequality.</p>

<p>But <strong>abstractions are only useful when they’re built upon a well-designed foundation of primitives</strong>. When abstractions are instead used as patches over flimsy Swiss cheese layers of infrastructure, they’re bound to go wrong and leak, making their presence known to the world at the most inopportune time. Like, say, when GME is attempting to go to the moon but passengers are getting ejected for mysterious reasons. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Joel Spolsky’s Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> asserts that “All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.” Assuming the truth of this statement, building unnecessary layers of complex abstractions compounds the risk for no good return.</p>

<h2 id="fintechs-stopgap-unicorns">Fintech’s Stopgap Unicorns</h2>

<p>The brave new world of fintech software consists of many such abstractions that really ought not to exist in an ideal world with better financial infrastructure. It’s a classic American story of governmental inaction and private opportunists seeking to fill the gap, providing acceptable service and pocketing some hefty middleman profits in the meantime. The existence of these entrenched middlemen further dampens any political interest in solving root causes of central dysfunction, and so the cycle is perpetuated.</p>

<p>Take Venmo for example. Nations around the world have begun setting up open banking APIs for peer-to-peer payments and other services by legally mandating interconnectability. The European Union’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive">Revised Payment Services Directive</a> went into effect in 2018 putting Europe at the forefront of open banking initiatives. Supporting payments is a core function that makes a bank a bank, and in the 21st century, those payments occur over the internet and so we expect instant deposits. Instead, if we rely on existing open standards for payment in the US, ie. ACH deposits, it seems the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/ach-transfers">fastest we can do is a few business days</a> or pay up for expensive wire transfers. And conveniently those are extra days where funds are in limbo mean that banks can earn some extra interest.</p>

<p>The US has taken a market-driven approach to hoping for more interconnectedness between banks, resulting in Zelle, a P2P payment system created by a bank consortium that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/business/zelle-banks-fraud.html">is sometimes secure</a>. Meanwhile Venmo has the first-mover advantage in the P2P payment space, and has built out a formidable network of users in a domain where implicit trust in identities is critical. Don’t like those options? You’re also free to use Messenger Pay, Apple Pay, CashApp, among a myriad set of options. Clearly, the fragmentation is killing us here, making what intuitively wants to be a well-designed protocol a mess of walled gardens with varying functionality. These days, it’s hard to even grasp how protocols like email, or heck even USPS mail, ever came to fruition against the alternative crop of self-interested ecosystems.</p>

<p>Venmo won by building an abstracted network that appears to support instant peer-to-peer payments based just on a username. Underneath, of course, it rarely arranges for any bank transfers at all, and simply adjusts numbers in a database until a user actually wants to cash out. In the meantime, parent company PayPal can enjoy <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/20/what-are-apps-venmo-doing-your-money/">the returns on idle capital</a> chilling in user wallets. This middleman profit, along with various fees for third-party integrations, seems like a fair concession for the services provided. But it gets worse: <a href="https://github.com/ccorcos/venmo-dark-patterns">Venmo is filled with dark patterns</a> that try to encourage you to share as much financial data as possible with them and others, in vague hopes of building “a social network” since apparently that’s the only end game allowed in the Valley. Perhaps outsourcing critical financial functions to growth-hungry companies with flimsy morals wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p>

<p>Plaid is another example of a Silicon Valley fintech darling filling in a gap resulting from our lack of an interbank API. Plaid allows users to connect bank accounts to other apps by logging into bank accounts on users’ behalf and scraping relevant data. Again, it’s easy to spot the …</p></section></div>

      <p><strong>1. Trade Options</strong></p><p><em>Fastest</em></p><p>No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money.&nbsp;</p><p>The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.</p><p>Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.</p><p>I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, <a href="https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">use this link to start trading with Cash App</a> and you’ll get free money to lose right away.</p><p>The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.</p><p><em>- Andrew Tye</em></p><p><strong>2. Write a Book</strong></p><p><em>Most consistent</em></p><p>You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – <a href="https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">take a look here</a> if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.</p><p><strong>3. Teach Online Courses</strong></p><p><em>Most helpful</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.</p><p>Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.</p><p><strong>4. Get a Degree</strong></p><p><em>Most socially acceptable</em></p><p>This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (<a href="https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">research here</a>). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location). </p><p>Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!</p><p><strong>5. Become an Inventor</strong></p><p><em>Most fun</em></p><p>Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).</p><p>I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:</p><p><em>Barking Bulb</em>: Scare away intruders with a bark</p><p>Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you!&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;D or go to production.</p><p><strong>6. Do Internet Advertising </strong></p><p><em>Most controversial&nbsp;</em></p><p>Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.</p><p>This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.</p><p><strong>7. Stop finishing Projects</strong></p><p><em>Biggest loss</em></p><p>I have completely mastered this one. It has a sweet combination of money lost from working for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This is a question that often arises in the product world and it requires our time to unpack it. Though these roles are somewhat similar and they work towards achieving the same set of goals, we then ought to look at the clear line distinction in the line of duty of the individuals and performance metric used to evaluate the success achieved by each role to help us understand them better and also help you figure out the most suitable for you.</p><p>These roles vary from company to company as in the case of a startup, a product manager is often tasked with the duty of these 3 roles while in larger or enterprise companies, there are 3 or more different roles in the product team working at different capacities to ensure that the right product is shipped and meet the demands of users.</p><p>While the product manager’s role is one that has come to limelight, the product marketing manager and product owner role have also been adopted by a lot of companies depending on their product and company culture. In this article, we will explain the difference between these roles and the job requirement of the individual involved.</p><h3 id="the-product-manager">The Product Manager</h3><p>These individuals are often referred to as mini CEOs of a product. They conduct customer surveys to figure out the customer’s pain and build solutions to address it. The PM also prioritizes what features are to be built next and prepares and manages a cohesive and digital product roadmap and strategy.</p><h3 id="the-product-marketing-manager">The Product Marketing Manager</h3><p>The PMM communicates vital product value — the “why”, “what” and “when” of a product to intending buyers. He manages the go-to-market strategy/roadmap and also oversees the pricing model of the product. The primary goal of a PMM is to create demand for the products through effective messaging and marketing programs so that the product has a shorter sales cycle and higher revenue.</p><h3 id="the-product-owner">The Product Owner</h3><p>This role exists in a scrum environment — <em><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum" title="Scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scrum</a> is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.</em></p><p>A product owner (PO) maximizes the value of a product through the creation and management of the product backlog, creation of user stories for the development team. The product owner is the customer’s representative to the development team. He addresses customer’s pain points by managing and prioritizing a visible product backlog. The PO is the first point of call when the development team needs clarity about interpreting a product feature to be implemented.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Going more practical, we will use a hypothetical case study of a tech company, Slyde, to explain these roles to clearly understand their day-to-day duties.</p><p>Slyde is a financial technology company based in Lagos, Nigeria with coverage in other African countries. The company has been providing payment solutions through its web-based application but has noticed a large churn rate in areas with poor internet connection which in turn delay users from completing their transaction. The product team made this observation and has been tasked to come up with a solution.</p><h3 id="where-does-the-product-manager-product-marketing-manager-and-the-product-owner-come-in">Where does the Product Manager, Product Marketing Manager, and the Product Owner come in?</h3><p><strong>PM</strong>: The Product Manager will interface with the users through user interviews/feedback surveys or other means to hear directly from the users. They will come up with hypotheses alongside the team and validate them through prototyping and user testing. They will then create a strategy on the feature and align the team and stakeholders around it. The PM who is also the chief custodian of the entire product roadmap will, therefore, be tasked with the duty of prioritization. Before going ahead to carry out research and strategy, they will have to convince the stakeholders if it is a good choice to build the feature in context at that particular time or wait a bit longer based on the content of the roadmap.</p><p><strong>PMM</strong>: The product marketing manager is tasked with market feasibility and discovering if the features being built align with the company’s sales and revenue plan for the period. They also make research on how sought-after the feature is being anticipated and how it will impact the budget. They communicate the values of the feature; the why, what, and when to potential buyers — In this case users in countries with poor internet connection.</p><p><strong>PO</strong>: The product owner will first have to prioritize the backlog to see if there are no important tasks to be executed and if this new feature is worth leaving whatever is being built currently. They will also consider the development effort required to build the feature i.e the time, tools, and skill set that will be required. They will be the one to tell if the expertise of the current developers is enough or if more engineers or designers are needed to be able to deliver at the scheduled time. The product owner is also armed with the task of interpreting the product/feature requirements for the development team. They serve as the interface between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><hr><p>Lastly,</p><p>The goal of a product team is to delight its user by providing an excellent solution to their pain points regardless of the job title/role. Irrespective of your job role on a product team, you should always be driven by user empathy and the company’s goal as this will in-turn make you collaborate better among the team. A product person should first and foremost see themselves as a product leader — one who makes sure the user’s need is always advocated for, despite top executive declination, the product person is to persuasively align the executive to this.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job. — Melissa Perri</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>So, regardless of your job role, a great product person will always act in the stead of a product manager and never streamline herself to the JD only but be actively involved directly or indirectly in every phase of the product development cycle. When the role is clearly understood and the duties implemented collaboratively as a team, every aspect of the product comes together in one beautiful piece.</p><p>This article first appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-product-owner-8ab08bc45662" title="Medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olufisayo-babalola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Olufisayo Babalola</a> for reviewing this article.</p><hr><h3 id="sources">Sources:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/product-manager?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Image by airfocus on Unsplash</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]>

I spend way too much time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about.  But it also leaves a fella feeling like he <b>really needs to keep up</b> with all this stuff.  I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, I find that I straddle the line on this. As a long-time contractor, I try to stay up to date on the New Shiny and will happily run with whatever flavor of the month language, framework, and programming paradigm that a given gig wants. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. I'm your guy. We're gonna change the world!
</p>
<p>
But for 
<a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">my</a>
<a href="https://unwaffle.com/">own</a>
<a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">stuff</a>, 
there's no way I'd use any of that crap. Good old C#, SQL Server and a proper boring stack and tool set that I know won't just up and fall over on a Saturday morning and leave me debugging NPM dependencies all weekend instead of bouldering in the forest with the kids. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. If that means I have to write a "for" loop and declare variables and risk 19 year old kids snooting down at my code, so be it.
</p>
<h4>I can't tell you how nice it is to have software in production on a boring stack. It gives you freedom to do other things.</h4>

<p>
I can (and often do) go entire months without touching the codebase of my main rent-paying products. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive.
</p>
<p>
It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. In my world, that's Windows Update's job. Big New Releases come and go, but they're all 100% backwards compatible, so when you get around to upgrading it's just a few minutes of point and clicking with nothing broken.
</p>
<p>
I see it as analogous to <b>Compound Interest, but to productivity</b>. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, the key is to never get so far down in to that comfy hole that you can't hop back into the present day when it's time to talk shop with the cool kids.  Shine on, flavor of the week!

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>

<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>

<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>

<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>

<p>This is what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype," criticism that actually builds on – and depends on – maintaining the halo of devastating potency that surrounds overhyped technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>2018 was almost the year we won the Right to Repair.</p>
<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf</a></p>
<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution">https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution</a></p>
<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again</a></p>
<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>
<p>The conversion of London into a …</p></div></article></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when  members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started  beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the  group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the  videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a>  as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million  members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in  order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This  quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall  Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target  where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a  rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop  stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by  the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion,  hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their  longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund,  Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a>  Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). An even bigger fund,  Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army  needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other  online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side  of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and  crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the  group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted  justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by  Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks  earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated  warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all  days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors  were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as  Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that  it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its  users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had  identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to  “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate  to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over  100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store,  Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal  trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their  24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions,  covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in  reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price  levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks  out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig  in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and  started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy  outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online  trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment,  and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of  censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a>  of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president  was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we  could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we  would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President  Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further  “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However,  much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these  speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power  has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a  genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat  passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected  insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose  Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against  WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was  being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything  that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as  these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you  visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably  reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a>  such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could  be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The  founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One  Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small  percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many  content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a>  the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social  networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the  dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics  of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down  on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that  ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to  recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts,  leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so  voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may  not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher  complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world  of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the  harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem  down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will  be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized,  centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech  companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship  is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon  that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they  exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to  WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this  issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left  and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when  she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial  crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former  treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her  with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she  recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can  say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them.  Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas.  People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders  also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s  precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social  media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in  number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social  networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to  effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent  elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall  Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any  censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After  the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about  the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was  “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by  the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by  social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including  Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud  Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but  they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to  have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the  narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit  from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could  possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in  the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a  tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame  for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016.  Social …</p></div></div>

<b>Moscow, February 2, 2021</b> – The Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) announce that the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals, has published interim results of a Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V, confirming the vaccine’s high efficacy and safety. Sputnik V, which is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform, is the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
In the interim efficacy analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, where data on 19,866 volunteers were included in the efficacy analysis (14,964 of whom received the vaccine and 4,902 the placebo), the two-dose treatment of Sputnik V administered 21 days apart demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% against COVID-19. The calculation is based on the analysis of 78 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified in the placebo group (62 cases) and in the vaccine group (16 cases). Sputnik V generated a robust humoral and cell mediated immune response.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alexander Gintsburg, Director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The publication of internationally peer reviewed data on Sputnik V’s clinical trial results is a great success in the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian vaccine’s safety and high efficacy are shown by the hard scientific data presented and I congratulate the entire team of Gamaleya National Research Center for this monumental achievement. Several vaccines have already been created based on human adenoviruses and this tool is one of the most promising for development of new vaccines in the future.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,</b> commented:
</p>
<p>
“This is a great day in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The data published by The Lancet proves that not only Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine, but also one of the best. It fully protects against severe COVID-19 according to data which has been independently compiled and reviewed by peers and then published in The Lancet. Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90% but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of +2 to +8 degrees and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Hildegund C.J. Ertl, M.D., Professor, Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, USA,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious disease or death, which in the end is the most crucial parameter; we can all deal with the sniffles as long as we stay out of the hospital or the graveyard. Even after a single dose of this prime-boost regimen protection against disease was at 87.6%. Sputnik V is thus more effective than the AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. Sputnik V, which, unlike the equally efficacious RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna, can be stored in the fridge, will be of tremendous value to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Cecil Czerkinsky, PhD, M.D., Research Director, National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm), France,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The interim results of the phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V COVID adenovirus vector vaccine are fairly impressive. This vaccine appears to be highly efficacious and immunogenic across age groups. This is clearly good news as this dual formulation vaccine is comparatively easy to manufacture and to deploy amid the anticipated global shortage of vaccines and logistical problems in vaccination roll-out of temperature-sensitive vaccines recently authorized for emergency use.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Omar Sued, President of the Society of infectologists, Argentina,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The paper, published in The Lancet, confirms successful results and provides additional information about the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine in different subgroups. From the public health´s point of view, the efficacy of the vaccine was very high. The safety profile was very good. The dissemination of this information is vital for informing the scaling up and rollout of this vaccine worldwide.”
</p>
<p>
<b>David Livermore, Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of East Anglia, UK,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“Presently the world needs all the good vaccines that it can get against COVID-19. And these are impressive results: Sputnik V is the first adenovirus vector vaccine to achieve the 90% efficacy seen with the two mRNA vaccines.”
</p>
<p>
According to the peer-reviewed study results, the vaccine provides full protection against severe cases of the novel coronavirus infection. Among the confirmed severe cases of COVID-19, 20 were recorded in the placebo group, while none were recorded in the vaccine group. Due to the time needed for the immune response to develop, in the first week after vaccination there was no significant difference in protection against severe cases of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups, while in the period from 7 to 14 days the vaccine’s efficacy rose to 50%, in the period from 14 to 21 days to 74.1%, and to 100% from the 21st day, giving full protection against severe cases of the coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study included 2,144 volunteers over 60 years old with the maximum ages of 87 years (vaccine group) and 84 years (placebo group), showing great safety results for the elder age strata. The vaccine’s efficacy for the elderly was shown at 91.8% and did not differ statistically from the group of 18-60 years old, also demonstrating great safety and immunogenicity results.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: 70 episodes of serious adverse events (SAE) not related to COVID-19 were recorded in 68 study participants: in 45 volunteers from the vaccine group and 23 volunteers from the placebo group. None of these events were associated with the vaccination as confirmed by Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Most adverse events (94%) were mild and were limited to flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world to have demonstrated efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V stands out among these vaccines thanks to a number of key advantages, namely: a well-studied and highly efficient human adenoviral vector mechanism proven safe over decades; the vaccine’s low cost in comparison to other approaches; and fewer logistics requirements with a storage temperature of between two to eight degrees Celsius allowing for easier distribution worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body to generate a stable immune response.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Sputnik V uses two different vectors - based on human adenovirus serotypes Ad5 and Ad26 - in two separate shots, allowing for a more effective defense against the coronavirus than vaccines using the same vector for both shots. By deploying two different vectors, Sputnik V avoids a possible neutralizing effect and generates a durable and longer-lasting immune response.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, it’s success is also the reason why its closed approach has become so onerous. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In my <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic">previous post</a>, I remarked on the fact that composition, while central to our work as engineers, is often poorly supported by the tools we use. In this post I want to explore a specific trend away from this state of affairs, where composition is given the first-class treatment it deserves.</p><p>When engineering with atoms, composing components often consists of literally putting them together: you take piece A, move it close to piece B, and combine them by inserting tab X into slot Y. Sometimes an analogous case occurs in software: developers may instantiate instances of two particular design patterns in a class definition and compose them by ensuring the overlap meets both requirements, or copy in a template or project scaffold to compose a general structure with their specific use case.</p><p>Most of the time, however, software engineers compose by <em>reference</em>, making one part of the system conform to the interface of another and indirectly interact with the component exposing the interface through some pointer, handle, or name. These layers of indirection allow for more efficient reuse of components, clearer conceptual boundaries, and more specialized and dynamic composition. This benefits both the humans using the tools and the automated systems operating behind the scenes, at various time scales. Composition by named reference is so fundamental that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">one of the two foundational models of computation</a> revolves exclusively around referencing by name and resolving those references!</p><h2>Programming and networking</h2><p>Traditionally, most sophisticated name-based composition acted at the levels of building programs or of connecting entire machines.</p><p>Composition by name is ubiquitous in programming. We reference packages we want to use by a name and a version. We identify libraries we depend on by name. We call functions, consume data, implement interfaces, etc., all via their names. Then our tools take over: Our editors provide us documentation by name, our compilers look up type information and calling conventions by name, our static and dynamic linkers connect needed functionality across binary components by name.</p><p>Any user of post-Internet computers is intimately familiar with our industry's other venerable usage of names: finding another machine on the network. Every time you type a URL in your search bar, click a link, or configure an application to point to some specific service, you are composing computer resources by name. The most systematized and sophisticated aspect of these names is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a>, which gives you a high quality way to connect a top level name to a specific machine. Most of the rest of the URL is particular to each individual system, with at best weak conventions governing their use and meaning. But for both human and machine consumers, the domain name contains very precise semantics for composition at the machine level.</p><p>These names are not only crucial operationally, to put everything together in the system, they are also crucial cognitively, to put everything together in our minds. It's a clichéd joke that naming something is one of the two hardest problems in computer science, but that joke is based on the very serious fact that a name lets us treat a complex system as a single unit, and a good name helps us do that effectively.</p><p>DNS and programming language symbol resolution are at this point completely entrenched. They've been around in the relevant forms for the entire productive career of a huge portion of our industry. In more recent decades, however, some new approaches to name-based composition in new domains have emerged.</p><h2>Semantically-meaningful resource naming</h2><p>After the previous section, some of you may be wondering: What about the filesystem? It's true that files and other system resources have long been named by strings, with some weak structure for navigating trees of resources (i.e., the directory separator) and, on some systems, the type of file being named (the file extension). Similarly, other resources have long been referenced by name: <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a> names not the server at google.com, but the specific HTTPS service exposed by that server over TCP port 443.</p><p>The problem with these and other naming systems is that they put too much of the work of composition onto the users. With a few minor exceptions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">filesystem hierarchy standard</a> and file extensions, file paths tell you almost nothing about the file in question that you didn't already know. Almost no one looks at the full URL of a hyperlink and extracts meaningful information from it that wasn't present in the context of the link. This results in the status quo: these names are almost always treated as fully opaque identifiers, and very few common naming rules apply across teams and systems.</p><p>Some systems have taken steps to move beyond this situation, however. In this section I will briefly cover a few novel tools that in some cases have succeeded in and in others promise to provide <em>semantically meaningful</em> names to compose different computational resources.</p><h3>git</h3><p>I assume most of you are familiar with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, at a high level. At a primitive level, git operates on various types of <em>objects</em>, such as blobs, commits, or symlinks. At the human interface level, many of these objects are ultimately referenced by ad hoc unstructured names, such as "file x/y/z on branch foo". That being said, you've probably seen commits referenced by a <em>hash</em>, such as 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb. Hashes like this are what the human-readable names are translated into, and how all of the objects internally refer to each other.</p><p>What do the hashes mean? Each object can be <em>serialized</em>, i.e. written to a file such that it can be correctly reconstructed later, including references to any other objects it depends on. These serializations are <em>canonical</em>, such that any two objects that are the same will have byte for byte the same serialization. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a> on the contents of these serialized files then allows the git tools to give each object a short name that captures the full information content of the object, modulo unlikely hash collisions. We therefore call these <em>content-addressed</em> names.</p><p>Why should we use content-addressed names? In short, because they allow different components of the system to cheaply refer to each other with a high degree of reliability: If some commit object says that its associated filesystem tree has some file at a particular path, I know that whenever I refer to that file via relative references from the commit, I will get a file with exactly the same contents.</p><p>This allows for safe deduplication of files across commits and efficient communication protocols for distributing repositories across the network. It also gives a much more precise meaning to the names in question: "the file at x/y/z" can refer, at different times and on different systems, to any kind of file the relevant filesystem supports, whereas "the file at x/y/z in the tree of commit 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb" refers, for most intents and purposes, to exactly one file with specific contents.</p><h3>Nix</h3><p><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-about-nix">Nix</a> is a package manager for Unix systems. It is built on several innovations, but the one relevant for this post is the Nix store, where the filesystem resources associated with packages are managed.</p><p>Like git, Nix manages some of its filesystem resources by content-addressed name, using essentially the same logic as git's hash-based content addressing. By themselves, however, such names are inadequate to Nix's goal of highly reliable and accurate dependency management with composition across packages. If I've built package foo 1.0 against some specific content-addressed instance of package bar 2.0, I can calculate the content and thus a content-addressed name of the resulting package. But if you want to build foo 1.0 against the newly released bar 2.1, you can't reuse anything in that content addressed name and must rebuild from scratch.</p><p>Nix addresses this issue with what I call <em>recipe-addressed</em> names: Some filesystem resources are named not by their own content but by the content of a serialization of <em>a deterministic build recipe</em> for creating it. The nature of these build recipes is such that it is much easier to substitute in different versions, configurations, etc. anywhere in the dependency tree and recalculate what the new name of the results should be.</p><p>With content-addressed names for bootstrapping, and recipe-addressed names for building up more complex packages, Nix opens up a whole new world of package management. Nix can ensure that many different machines, however different their configurations, have exactly the same package installed.</p><p>Nix can safely reuse common dependencies between packages, parallelize builds, and distribute builds across multiple machines. Large centralized binary caches are possible with a <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">decentralized trust mechanism</a> built on top. On top of these capabilities, <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html#nixos">entire system configurations</a> can be deterministically captured in a single name, allowing reproducible deployments and much more reliable migration of personal systems across computers.</p><h3>Nelson</h3><p><a href="https://getnelson.io/">Nelson</a> is a "cloud-native" service orchestration framework built to take advantage of modern distribution, resource management, and coordination mechanisms. Among other things, Nelson enables deploying an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure">immutable infrastructure</a>-style network topology while retaining efficient garbage collection of unneeded services. Nelson achieves this by requiring services to reference each other via name resolution mechanisms it populates from high level service configurations. Each service configuration specifies the other services it depends upon, providing both a service name, which has meaning to the user, and a <a href="https://semver.org/"><em>semantic version</em></a>, which contains information about cross-version compatibility. Nelson leverages the information in the dependency specification and keeps track of which services depend on which, allowing it to safely remove old instances of services that are not …</p></div></div></div></div>

Let's go over a simple problem to see how this can be useful.</p><p>For this problem, we are given an array <code>arr</code>, and a subarray size <code>k</code>, and we are asked to find the <em>average</em> of <em>all</em> subarrays in <code>arr</code> of size <code>k</code>. So given an array like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and a subarray size <code>k = 2</code>, the correct answer would be <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code> because:</p><ul><li><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> has three subarrays of size 2, namely <code>[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]</code>.</li><li>The average of the first subarray is <code>1 + 2 / 2 = 1.5</code>, the average of the second is <code>2.5</code> (using the same formula), and the average of the third is <code>3.5</code>.</li><li>Putting this together we get the final result <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code>.</li></ul><p>Given these steps, it seems pretty clear that in designing an algorithm to solve this problem we would have to (1) iterate through every subarray then (2) find the average of each and append it to the result array.</p><p>A straightforward way to find every subarray of an array is to iterate through each index of the array and <em>construct</em> the subarray that begins at that index by iterating <code>k</code> more times. In this second iteration we can also sum up the numbers to compute the resulting average. Here's what that would look like:</p><p>Doing that for <em>every</em> index in the array, we get the final algorithm:</p><p>Notice the number on the top right of the animation. This number represents the total number of steps required to compute the result given the inputs <code>arr</code> and <code>k</code>. Try adding two more items and see how that number changes—it went up, by a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>Is there a better way?</p><p>Looking back at the algorithm, notice that most of the time we're counting numbers that we've already included before. Let's look at the animation again, this time highlighting all the double counts in red:</p><p>When the algorithm finishes, only 2 elements <strong>were not double counted!</strong> It turns out that no matter what inputs, this implementation will <em>always</em> double count every element except for the first and the last (try playing around with the inputs to convince yourself).</p><p>So why are we double counting in the first place? If we look at the first two subarrays, we see there's a lot of overlap:</p><p>What if, on each step, we only take into account the <em>differences</em> instead? In other words, is there a way to get the sum of the second subarray from the sum of the first? If so, we would be able to <em>derive</em> the sum of the second subarray rather than recounting every element again.</p><p>In the example above, we can get the sum of the <strong>second subarray by subtracting 1 and adding 5</strong> to the sum of the first.</p><p>This reduces the sum computation from <code>k</code> iterations to only one iteration! This is also where the sliding window namesake comes from—it's as if we have a window of 4 items that we <em>slide</em> to the next subarray.</p><p>Maybe adding a border around the items would make the window more clear:</p><p>With this key insight let's rewrite the algorithm. Remember that the algorithm receives two inputs - an array of numbers <code>arr</code> and a size of subarray <code>k</code>.</p><ol><li>At the start, we <em>build</em> the window—iterate until our window contains <code>k</code> items—while keeping track of the sum.</li><li>Then, we <em>slide</em> the window one item over, updating the sum by subtracting the item no longer in the window and adding the item that was added to the window. By doing this we ensure that the sum stays in sync with the items that are in the window.</li><li>With this sum we can compute the average as before.</li></ol><p>And that's the find all averages problem using the sliding window pattern! Notice how this implementation only needs 7 steps to calculate the sum instead of 13 with the previous implementation. Now that doesn't seem to be too big of a difference, but look how blazing fast the optimal implementation is compared to our previous one:</p><p>While the window is building, both algorithms are going at the same pace (try changing the size of k to equal to the size of the array—both algorithms will finish at the same time!). However, once the window is complete, the optimal algorithm blazes off and terminates in less than half the time it takes for the naive algorithm to finish.</p><h2>Generalizing the Pattern</h2><p>Of course we're not limited to only counting averages. The sliding window pattern can be generalized to any problem that involves computing <em>something</em> in the subarray. As long as the problem has some definition of a window size, the pattern essentially boils down to:</p><ol><li>Maintaining some <strong>state</strong> in that window, and</li><li>keeping that state in sync with the items in the window through <strong>constant-time operations</strong>.</li></ol><p>By "constant-time operations" I mean without using further iterations and only using the stuff that leaves/enters the window.</p><p>In the case of the averages problem, the state that we're maintaining is the <strong>sum of the items</strong>. We're keeping this sum in sync with the items in the window by subtracting the item that's leaving and adding the item that's entering.</p><h3>Permutation in a String</h3><p>Here's another problem that makes use of the same concept of maintaining state and synchronizing that state. The problem's pretty simple—given a string and some pattern, determine if the string contains any <em>permutation</em> of that pattern. For example, given the string <code>aaacb</code> and the pattern <code>abc</code>, the algorithm should return <code>true</code> because the substring <code>acb</code> is a permutation of <code>abc</code>.</p><p>This is not as obvious of a sliding window problem than the problem we just worked through, but if you think of a string as an array of characters and a substring as a subarray, then the similarities start to show.</p><p>I'm not going to walk through each logical step to get to the optimal solution (that would take a minute!), but here are the main ideas:</p><ol><li>A string can only be a permutation of another if it's the same length. <em>This gives us the size of the window = <code>pattern.length</code></em>.</li><li>A string is <strong>exactly</strong> a permutation of another if it contains the exact same number of letters. A way to keep track of this is through a map of character -&gt; count pairs. <em>This gives us the state that we have to maintain</em>.</li><li>We need a way to update <em>and compare</em> the map in constant time. <em>Through this we fulfill the second condition of synchronizing state through constant operations</em>.</li></ol><p>With those ideas, here's the final solution:</p><p>If you're interested in more details of the algorithm (particularly the constant-time updates and comparison), open the note below!</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

				<p>Kubernetes has demonstrated the power of a well architected control plane with a great API. The industry is beginning to notice that this control plane can be used to do much more than orchestrate containers, and are increasingly looking to use the Kubernetes control plane to manage all of their infrastructure.</p><p>Several “cloud provider infrastructure” addons exist for Kubernetes. These addons provide a Kubernetes interface to a cloud provider’s infrastructure - databases, queues, etc. The three major clouds each maintain their own - Google Config Connector, Azure Service Operator, and Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes. Each exposes their respective cloud’s control plane APIs as custom resources, allowing Kubernetes users to manage an RDS instance (for example) using the same tools they would use to manage a <code>Deployment</code> or a <code>ConfigMap</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/HeaderHero.svg"><figcaption>Crossplane exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources.</figcaption></figure><p>Crossplane is often compared to the various cloud provider infrastructure addons. There are certainly similarities - it is also a Kubernetes addon, and it also exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources. Crossplane even <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/accelerating-crossplane-provider-coverage-with-ack-and-azure-code-generation-towards-100-percent-coverage-of-all-cloud-services/">shares code with some of these addons</a>. Where Crossplane differs is in how we expose cloud provider APIs.</p><blockquote>
<p>The Crossplane community believes that the typical developer using Kubernetes to deploy their application shouldn’t have to deal with low level infrastructure APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on our experiences as platform builders, SREs, and application developers we’ve designed Crossplane as a toolkit to build your own custom resources on top of any API - often those of the cloud providers. We think this approach is critical to enable <em>usable</em> self-service infrastructure in Kubernetes.</p><p>In this post we’ll demonstrate that seemingly simple tasks like spinning up a new database in the cloud for your applications to consume can often be more complicated than it would at first seem, and how Crossplane is designed to help tame that complexity.</p><p>Crossplane today consists of three things:</p><ol><li><em>Providers</em> extend Crossplane with custom resources that can be used to declaratively configure a system. The AWS provider for example, adds custom resources for AWS services like RDS and S3. We call these ‘managed resources’. Managed resources match the APIs of the system they represent as closely as possible, but they’re also opinionated. Common functionality like status conditions and references work the same no matter which provider you’re using - all managed resources comply with the Crossplane Resource Model, or XRM.</li><li><em>Composition</em> allows a platform team to define new custom resources that are composed of managed resources. We call these composite resources, or XRs. An XR typically groups together a handful of managed resources into one logical resource, exposing only the settings that the platform team deems useful and deferring the rest to an API-server-side template we call a ‘Composition’.</li><li><em>Packages</em> allow a platform team to quickly package, share, and declaratively install new kinds of composite resources and the providers they build on.</li></ol><blockquote>Despite the name, “provider” doesn’t necessarily mean “cloud provider”. Crossplane has providers that add support for managing databases on a SQL server, managing Helm releases, and <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/providers-101-ordering-pizza-with-kubernetes-and-crossplane/">ordering pizza</a>.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/Crossplanecity.svg"><figcaption>When we founded Crossplane we focused on supporting the most useful resources.</figcaption></figure><p>When we founded the Crossplane project we started at the managed resource layer. We focused on the resources we thought would be the most useful to application developers - things like cloud databases, caches, and storage buckets. We quickly heard from early adopters that being able to spin up these resources alone <em>wasn’t enough</em>. An RDS instance might also need a security group or a subnet group to be reachable. GCP Cloud SQL instances and Azure SQL servers face similar issues. This pattern permeates cloud infrastructure; another example we see often is folks wanting to create an IAM policy for each DynamoDB table they create. </p><p>Let’s dig into the example of an application developer requesting an SQL database for their application to use. An experience you initially hope will look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: RDSInstance

<p>You might notice that we create a database and a user in the above example - something the RDS API does not support natively.</p><blockquote>Sometimes spinning up practically functional infrastructure requires multiple providers - even if you only use one cloud. In this case we use the SQL provider to finish what we started with the AWS provider.</blockquote><p>This will be an imposing amount of configuration for some application developers. They want to be able to self service their infrastructure needs, but shouldn’t need to be experts in the features and functionality of cloud provider APIs to do so. This is where Composition comes in - it allows a platform team to offer their application developers an experience much closer to the one they originally envisioned. Using Composition the application developer experience can look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: example.org/v1
kind: ExampleCoDatabase
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  parameters:
    storageGB: 20
    username: example-user
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      engine: mysql
      class: production
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: example-database-credentials 
</code></pre>
<p>This is a composite resource - an XR.</p><blockquote>When an application developer creates, updates, or deletes this XR Crossplane can create, update, or delete the more verbose set of managed resources from the previous example.</blockquote><p>Composition allows the infrastructure experts - the platform team - to determine what settings their application developers need, and how to use those settings to produce an RDS instance, security group, database, etc. In this example the application developer can influence the size of the database but not its backup settings, which are enforced by the platform team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/CrossplaneConsole@2x.png"><figcaption>Framing your opinions at the API level fosters automation and eases integration.</figcaption></figure><p>You may wonder why a platform team would use Composition rather than a familiar, existing tool like Helm or Kustomize. While it’s true that there are similarities, we feel that it’s better to frame your organisation's opinions at the API level, rather than via client-side tooling. For example when you use Crossplane to expose the above purpose-built <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> API:</p><ul><li>Any REST client (from kubectl to curl to Python) can create an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> with a single API call. This fosters automation and eases integration with other systems.</li><li>Policy is enforced. RBAC can ensure at the API level that application developers may influence only the fields exposed by an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. The platform team can ensure application developers have RBAC access to configure the settings they need, and nothing else.</li><li>RBAC is framed around your desired abstractions. Access is granted “to create an ExampleCo database”, not “to create an RDS instance, a security group, etc etc”.</li></ul><p>One novel design folks notice when they start using Crossplane is that most Crossplane custom resources are cluster scoped - they exist above the scope of any Kubernetes namespace. While this can seem odd at first, it’s another decision that was informed by real world scenarios.</p><p>Take the above <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. Assume that several teams of application developers, each with their own namespace, want …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>It’s very hard to get hired as an entry-level software developer today.</p><p>There are more than ten times as many senior web developer jobs for every junior web developer job on both VentureLoop.com (jobs at startups) and Indeed.com. Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past month, two things happened to me that made me realize how glad I'm for using a password manager, namely <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>First thing is about a login page. I was searching for a Github repo on DuckDuckGo, and I clicked on a link in the search results. As I was about to fill in the password with a 1Password shortcut, I noticed that 1Password wasn't filling in the login details. How strange, I thought. Puzzled, I looked at the url. And then I saw it—I almost fell for a phishing attack! The url was <a href="https://marcel.is/1password/github.com.cnpmjs.org">github.com.cnpmjs.org</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. I knew of phishing attacks, and thought I'd never fell for such a simple trick. Yet, I almost did.</p>
<p>Second thing is about email. As I'm migrating away from gmail, I thought I would check out the spam folder. I usually don't do that, but I thought I'd peek in. One email caught my eye: the email subject was my password. The site must have been compromised and the attacker got hold of my email and password. Fortunately, the damage radius was minimal, as I have generated unique passwords for each site.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>The Modern Single Board Computer such as the infamous Raspberry Pi are designed to run full fledged desktop operating systems, consume a tiny amount of power and be affordable for just about anyone. </p>



<div><p>What happens if the typical SBC is scaled down tenfold? What would someone do with such a device? </p><p>The Lichee Nano Pi is exactly this, the entire Computer is the size of an SD card, runs Linux and has 20 GPIO pins including SPI, TWI and UART. </p><p>Many would recognise this device as a micro controller along the lines of an Arduino Nano or RPI Pico although this is absolutely not the case. With 32MB of DDR SDRAM, 16MB SPI Flash and a 900MHz Arm 926EJS CPU its actually a very small computer! </p></div>



<p>Out of the box the Lichee Nano Pi supports the following Operating Systems:</p>



<ul><li>BSP Linux 3.10.</li><li>Mainline Linux 4.10.</li><li>RT-Thread</li></ul>



<p>Common Linux distributions are few and far between however community members have worked on various ports. Buildroot makes it simple to create a bootable install for either the built-in SPI flash or SD card. </p>



<p>Unfortunately Armbian have not released their distro for the Lichee Nano Pi. However I spent some time over the Xmas period to create a Debian port. </p>



<h2>Running Debian on the Lichee Nano Pi</h2>

<div><p>Debian runs almost flawlessly! Consuming just 7MB of RAM at idle there are plenty of resources free, the 900MHz ARM 926EJS CPU performs perfectly fine and networking is handled via a USB OTG Ethernet Adaptor – Whilst the SPIO Wifi module would work in Debian you do loose access to the Micro SD card slot and sadly a Debian install will not fit on the 16MB SPI flash. </p><p>You can find out how I created a Debian install over at my <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/lichee-nano-pi-will-it-run-debian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. <br>Find out more about my projects on <a href="https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. </p></div>

        <p>These are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their
skills as professional programmers because of high information
density, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.</p>
<p>You don't need to read books to improve as a developer but
they are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.</p>
<h3 id="effective-python:-90-specific-ways-to-write-better-python">Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python</h3><p>If you're a Python developer wanting to improve your craft you should
read this. Good Python starts with a deep understanding of the
standard library and language.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance-browser-networking">High Performance Browser Networking</h3><p>If your code is triggered by a desktop or mobile browser you should
read this. It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile
networks, browser network protocols, and fundementals of networking.</p>
<h3 id="designing-data-intensive-applications">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</h3><p>If your databases and APIs are a bottleneck you should read this. A
solid introduction to distributed computing, data transfer, indexing,
etc.</p>
<h3 id="site-reliability-engineering:-how-google-runs-production-services">Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Services</h3><p>If you are responsible for services in production you should read
this. It's Google specific but is an excellent background on practices
for monitoring and maintaining production environments.</p>
<h3 id="that's-it!">That's it!</h3><p>Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for
me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean Code</li>
<li>JavaScript the Good Parts</li>
<li>Design Patterns/Gang of Four</li>
<li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
<li>A Philosophy of Software Design</li>
</ul>
<p>They're not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<div><span size="+2">Silence is a Commons by Ivan Illich</span><p>
						
						Computers are doing to communication<br>
						what fences did to pastures<br>
						and cars did to streets.</p><p>
						
						by Ivan Illich</p><p>
						
						
						
						
						Minna-san, gladly I accept the honour of addressing this forum on Science and Man. The theme that Mr. Tsuru proposes, "The Computer-Managed Society," sounds an alarm. Clearly you foresee that machines which ape people are tending to encroach on every aspect of people's lives, and that such machines force people to behave like machines. The new electronic devices do indeed have the power to force people to "communicate" with them and with each other on the terms of the machine. Whatever structurally does not fit the logic of machines is effectively filtered from a culture dominated by their use.</p><p>
						
						The machine-like behaviour of people chained to electronics constitutes a degradation of their well-being and of their dignity which, for most people in the long run, becomes intolerable. Observations of the sickening effect of programmed environments show that people in them become indolent, impotent, narcissistic and apolitical. The political process breaks down, because people cease to be able to govern themselves; they demand to be managed.</p><p>
						
						I congratulate Asahi Shimbun on its efforts to foster a new democratic consensus in Japan, by which your more than seven million readers become aware of the need to limit the encroachment of machines on the style of their own behaviour. It is important that precisely Japan initiate such action. Japan is looked upon as the capital of electronics; it would be marvellous if it became for the entire world the model of a new politics of self-limitation in the field of communication, which, in my opinion, is henceforth necessary if a people wants to remain self-governing.</p><p>
						
						Electronic management as a political issue can be approached in several ways. I propose, at the beginning of this public consultation, to approach the issue as one of political ecology. Ecology, during the last ten years, has acquired a new meaning. It is still the name for a branch of professional biology, but the term now increasingly serves as the label under which a broad, politically organized general public analyzes and influences technical decisions. I want to focus on the new electronic management devices as a technical change of the human environment which, to be benign, must remain under political (and not exclusively expert) control. I have chosen this focus for my introduction, because I thus continue my conversation with those three Japanese colleagues to whom I owe what I know about your country - Professors Yoshikazu Sakamoto, Joshiro Tamanoi and Jun Ui.</p><p>
						
						In the 13 minutes still left to me on this rostrum I will clarify a distinction that I consider fundamental to political ecology. I shall distinguish the environment as commons from the environment as resource. On our ability to make this particular distinction depends not only the construction of a sound theoretical ecology, but also - and more importantly - effective ecological jurisprudence Minna-san, how I wish, at this point, that I were a pupil trained by your Zen poet, the great Basho. Then perhaps in a bare 17 syllables I could express the distinction between the commons within which people's subsistence activities are embedded, and resources that serve for the economic production of those commodities on which modem survival depends. If I were a poet, perhaps I would make this distinction so beautifully and incisively that it would penetrate your hearts and remain unforgettable. Unfortunately I am not a Japanese poet. I must speak to you in English, a language that during the last 100 years has lost the ability to make this distinction, and - in addition - I must speak through translation. Only because I may count on the translating genius of Mr. Muramatsu do I dare to recover Old English meanings with a talk in Japan.</p><p>
						
						"Commons" is an Old English word. According to my Japanese friends, it is quite close to the meaning that iriai still has in Japanese "Commons," like iriai, is a word which, in preindustrial times, was used to designate certain aspects of the environment. People called commons those parts of the environment for which customary law exacted specific forms of community respect. People called commons that part of the environment which lay beyond their own thresholds and outside of their own possessions, to which, however, they had recognized claims of usage, not to produce commodities but to provide for the subsistence of their households. The customary law which humanized the environment by establishing the commons was usually unwritten. It was unwritten law not only because people did not care to write it down, but because what it protected was a reality much too complex to fit into paragraphs. The law of the commons regulates the right of way, the right to fish and to hunt, to graze, and to collect wood or medicinal plants in the forest.</p><p>
						
						An oak tree might be in the commons. Its shade, in summer, is reserved for the shepherd and his flock; its acorns are reserved for the pigs of the neighbouring peasants; its dry branches serve as fuel for the widows of the village; some of its fresh twigs in springtime are cut as ornaments for the church - and at sunset it might be the place for the village assembly. When people spoke about commons, iriai, they designated an aspect of the environment that was limited, that was necessary for the community's survival, that was necessary for different groups in different ways, but which, in a strictly economic sense, was not perceived as scarce.</p><p>
						
						When today, in Europe, with university students I use the term "commons" (in German Almende or Gemeinheit, in Italian gli usi civici) my listeners immediately think of the eighteenth century. They think of those pastures in England on which villagers each kept a few sheep, and they think of the "enclosure of the pastures" which transformed the grassland from commons into a resource on which commercial flocks could be raised. Primarily, however, my students think of the innovation of poverty which came with enclosure: of the absolute impoverishment of the peasants, who were driven from the land and into wage labour, and they think of the commercial enrichment of the lords.</p><p>
						
						In their immediate reaction, my students think of the rise of a new capitalist order. Facing that painful newness, they forget that enclosure also stands for something more basic. The enclosure of the commons inaugurates a new ecological order: Enclosure did not just physically transfer the control over grasslands from the peasants to the lord. Enclosure marked a radical change in the attitudes of society towards the environment. Before, in any juridical system, most of the environment had been considered as commons from which most people could draw most of their sustenance without needing to take recourse to the market. After enclosure, the environment became primarily a resource at the service of "enterprises" which, by organizing wage-labor, transformed nature into the goods and services on which the satisfaction of basic needs by consumers depends. This transformation is in the blind spot of political economy.</p><p>
						
						This change of attitudes can be illustrated better if we think about roads rather than about grasslands. What a difference there was between the new and the old parts of Mexico City only 20 years ago. In the old parts of the city the streets were true commons. Some people sat on the road to sell vegetables and charcoal. Others put their chairs on the road to drink coffee or tequila. Others held their meetings on the road to decide on the new headman for the neighbourhood or to determine the price of a donkey. Others drove their donkeys through the crowd, walking next to the heavily loaded beast of burden; others sat in the saddle. Children played in the gutter, and still people walking could use the road to get from one place to another.</p><p>
						
						Such roads were not built for people. Like any true commons, the street itself was the result of people living there and making that space liveable. The dwellings that lined the roads were not private homes in the modern sense - garages for the overnight deposit of workers. The threshold still separated two living spaces, one intimate and one common. But neither homes in this intimate sense nor streets as commons survived economic development.</p><p>
						
						In the new sections of Mexico City, streets are no more for people. They are now roadways for automobiles, for buses, for taxis, cars, and trucks. People are barely tolerated on the streets unless they are on their way to a bus stop. If people now sat down or stopped on the street, they would become obstacles for traffic, and traffic would be dangerous to them. The road has been degraded from a commons to a simple resource for the circulation of vehicles. People can circulate no more on their own. Traffic has displaced their mobility. They can circulate only when they are strapped down and are moved. </p><p>
						
						The appropriation of the grassland by the lords was challenged, but the more fundamental transformation of grassland (or of roads) from commons to resource has happened, until recently, without being subjected to criticism. The appropriation of the environment by the few was clearly recognized as an intolerable abuse By contrast, the even more degrading transformation of people into members of an industrial labour force and into consumers was taken, until recently, for granted. For almost a hundred years the majority of political parties has challenged the accumulation of environmental resources in private hands. However, the issue was argued in terms of the private utilization of these resources, not the distinction of commons. Thus …</p></div></div></div>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-htmx-with-aspnet-core | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-htmx-with-aspnet-core">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>PS:</strong> If you need assistance on any of your ASP.NET Core projects, I am <!-- --> <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/hire/">available for hire</a> <!-- --> for freelance work.</p><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a series of blog posts around the theme of <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/you-might-not-need-angular-introduction/">“You might not need Angular”</a>. The premise of that series was that we want to add tiny bits of interactivity to web pages in many situations without having to resort to a client-side framework such as Angular.</p>
<p>In that post, I mentioned that Blazor (<em>which at that stage was at version 0.5.0</em>) could improve things in the future. Blazor has since been released, and in many cases, it is a viable alternative to SPA frameworks. However, for me, it is still not feasible in many situations. Blazor Server suffers from latency and scalability issues, and Blazor WebAssembly has a big download size.</p>

<p>I believe there is still a middle ground where you may be happy with using Razor Pages or MVC, but want to add <em>sprinkles</em> of interactivity to some of your pages to give a better user experience.</p>
<p>In this new series, I will introduce you to <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, a library that allows you to do this. It works in a very similar fashion to the now-deprecated <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive">jQuery Unobtrusive Ajax library</a> which I used in the first series. I will also work through a few common scenarios and demonstrate how you can implement it with Razor Pages and HTMX.</p>
<p>This series consists of the following blog posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction (this blog post)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/htmx-deleting-items/">Deleting items from a list</a></li>
<li>Do a full page refresh when deleting items (coming 9 February)</li>
<li>Inline editing (coming 16 February)</li>
<li>Infinite scrolling (coming 23 February)</li>
<li>Real-time search (coming 2 March)</li>
</ol>
<h2>The HTMX library</h2>
<p>HTMX is a library that allows you to add features such as AJAX and DOM updates to your web pages. Instead of requiring you to write JavaScript, HTMX enables you to add this functionality by adding some attributes to your HTML markup.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of this model, let’s look at the following example from the HTMX website:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>hx-post</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/clicked<span>"</span></span> <span>hx-swap</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>outerHTML<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    Click Me
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that we have a <code>button</code> element with two additional <code>hx-*</code> attributes defined.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>hx-post</code> attribute tells HTMX that when a user clicks on the button, it should perform an HTTP POST request to <code>/clicked</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>hx-swap</code> attribute tells HTMX that it should replace the <code>button</code> element with the content from this request’s response.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will cover HTMX in more detail in the remaining blog posts in this series, but you can also refer to the <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/">HTMX documentation</a> if you want a better understanding of it.</p>
<h2>Installing HTMX in an ASP.NET Core application</h2>
<p>The quickest way to add HTMX to your ASP.NET Core application is to reference the script via <a href="https://unpkg.com/">UNPKG</a>. To do that, add the following script to the Razor Pages where you want to use it:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.1.0<span>"</span></span> <span>integrity</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>sha384-JVb/MVb+DiMDoxpTmoXWmMYSpQD2Z/1yiruL8+vC6Ri9lk6ORGiQqKSqfmCBbpbX<span>"</span></span> <span>crossorigin</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>anonymous<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The script above uses version 1.1.0, but you can refer to the <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/#installing">installation section</a> on the HTMX website for the latest version and installation instructions.</p>
<p>If you prefer to make use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">LibMan</a>, you can run the following command:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>libman <span>install</span> htmx.org@1.1.0 --provider unpkg --files dist/htmx.min.js</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, proceed to add the reference to the HTMX file as follows:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>~/lib/htmx.org/dist/htmx.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I gave you a brief introduction to this series and HTMX and demonstrated how you could add the HTMX library to your existing ASP.NET Core application. In the <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/htmx-deleting-items">next blog post</a>, I will show you how to use HTMX to delete items from a list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On August 22, 1994 (over 25 years ago) Jeff Bezos posted the first Amazon job offer to Usenet seeking a very talented developer to help launch the site. While Bezos hadn’t named it Amazon yet, the job posting on Usenet clearly shows that he needs a coder with lots of talent. In return he promises “meaningful equity ownership”. We can only imagine what that would be worth in Amazon stock today. Shel Kaphan, Amazon’s first CTO was hired shortly after the newsgroup post. It’s not clear whether or not he responded to the post but it’s very cool to see the history represented on Usenet.&nbsp; Here’s a look at the post.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://1t21h7uca2ehzzcj298yrla12.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/amazon-job-post.png" alt="Amazon's first job post" width="580" height="504" srcset="http://1t21h7uca2ehzzcj298yrla12.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/amazon-job-post.png 580w, http://1t21h7uca2ehzzcj298yrla12.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/amazon-job-post-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></p>
<p>The post reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well-capitalized start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet. You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible. You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent. Top-notch communication skills are essential. Familiarity with web servers and HTML would be helpful but is not necessary.</p>
<p>Expect talented, motivated, intense, and interesting co-workers. Must be willing to relocate to the Seattle area (we will help cover moving costs).</p>
<p>Your compensation will include meaningful equity ownership.</p>
<p>Send resume and cover letter to Jeff Bezos:</p>
<p>mail: be…@netcom.com<br>
fax: 206/828-0951<br>
US mail: Cadabra, Inc.<br>
10704 N.E. 28th St.<br>
Bellevue, WA 98004</p>
<p>We are an equal opportunity employer.</p>

<p>First job posting to world domination in 25 years, all from a single Usenet post 🙂</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Regularly, I discover myself thinking <em>"wow, that's so simple I can build this in a weekend"</em>. My rational brain kicks in at some point: <em>"Waaaaiiit a second, if it's so simple, why am I not seeing this done a million times?"</em>. Here I usually start better scoping and either find the answer to my question.</p><p>Often, my developer mind insists on "it's actually just two API endpoints and then I could do this and that". And often this holds true for the core functionality. If some <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/">basic validation</a> gives a green light for working on it from a commercial perspective, I still need to consider the tech stack and marketing approach, as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/why-build-it-and-they-will-come-wont-work-anymore">building alone doesn't do it</a>.</p><p>I'm not super fixed on the approach, my main goal is usually to keep long term overhead low. Laravel is my go-to solution for anything backend-heavy, but its power comes at a complexity cost too. For two little API endpoints used in, for example, a browser extension is a bit of an overkill.</p><p>Function as a service sounds like a great step towards "just having a few API endpoints". AWS Lambda is the name everyone is having in mind here. But any gains from simplicity are eaten up by AWS complexity. If you are new to AWS (Lambda), it easily takes you double or more time to get it running as you spend building the little lean function in the first place. This doesn't go well with the plan to "just chuck this out over the weekend".</p><h2 id="enter%3A-faasd">Enter: faasd <a href="#enter%3A-faasd">#</a></h2><p>Function as a Service should be easy. Here comes <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introducing-faasd/">faasd</a> into play. It's a self-hosted alternative to run functions. It allows you to run a simple copy &amp; paste installer script on your machine getting it up and running. It takes less than ten minutes to get to work. It's production-ready and helps to remove the learning curve involved with Kubernetes and co.</p><blockquote><p>faasd is a self-hosted alternative to AWS Lambda to run functions. Production-ready within minutes ⏲️</p></blockquote><p>Once you have deployed your faasd instance, it's a matter of one command to push your function into production. From there it's up to you what you like to build. I catch myself breaking up the structure of larger applications in functions. It builds the container, publishes, and deploys your function code ready-to-use in seconds. To run this you will need the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">FaaS CLI</a>. Again this is installed in under one minute thanks to copy and paste that just works.</p><p>Found a great library but it's written in the "wrong" language? Thanks to the flexibility, you can also jump between programming languages easily. I use a mix of nodejs, PHP, and Python by now.</p><blockquote><p>With functions you libraries aren't in the <em>wrong</em> language anymore.</p></blockquote><p>This helps to truly break up large applications into functional parts using the best tool for you.

Performance Benchmarks</h2> <p>Speed is important for data persistence solutions. Accordingly, we wanted to test how ObjectBox compares performance-wise to other Flutter Dart database options. Therefore, we looked for libraries with comparable levels of storage abstraction and feature set –&nbsp; so not just plain SQL/Key-value storage but also <a href="https://greenrobot.org/android/sqlite-access-with-an-orm-faq/">ORM</a>-like features. <a href="https://objectbox.io/flutter-databases-sqflite-hive-objectbox-and-moor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There doesn’t seem to be that much choice…&nbsp;</a></p> <p>We looked at some two popular approaches: <strong>sqflite</strong> a SQLite wrapper for Flutter (no Dart Native support), and <strong>Hive, </strong>a key-value store with Class-adapters which seems still popular although its technology is phased out (see below). As a third alternative we pulled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Firestore</a>, which does not really fit as it is no local database, but would be fun to compare anyway.</p> <h3>What we tested</h3> <p>To get an overview of the databases, we tested <strong>CRUD</strong> operations (create, read, update, delete). Each test was run multiple times and executed manually outside of the measured time. Data preparation and evaluation was also done outside of the measured time.</p> <p>We tried to keep the test implementations as close as possible to each other while picking the approaches recommended by the docs for each database. We open sourced the test code at <a href="https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance">https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance</a> if you want to have a closer look.</p> <h3>Performance Benchmark Results</h3> <figure><img width="2222" height="1338" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2222px, 100vw" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png 2222w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9ea992ae66876c4821b4c71df5f6e45b.objectbox-dart-performance-1280x771.png 1280w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a7622f4b339df3e20f43b6b0d4d93c85.objectbox-dart-performance-980x590.png 980w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c4249ff1e989bcb87ecc02fb380ffc78.objectbox-dart-performance-480x289.png 480w" nitro-lazy-src="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MzQwOjgxOQ==-1" src="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png" srcset="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png 2222w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9ea992ae66876c4821b4c71df5f6e45b.objectbox-dart-performance-1280x771.png 1280w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a7622f4b339df3e20f43b6b0d4d93c85.objectbox-dart-performance-980x590.png 980w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c4249ff1e989bcb87ecc02fb380ffc78.objectbox-dart-performance-480x289.png 480w"></figure> <p>Looking at the results, we can see ObjectBox performing significantly faster than sqflite across the board, with up to 70 times speedup in case of create &amp; update operations. Compared to Hive, the results are a little more varied, with Hive being faster at reading objects than ObjectBox (we come to that later in our outlook), and ObjectBox being faster at creating objects, about four times faster at updates and three times for deletes. As a mostly-online database, it becomes clear that Firestore’s performance is not really comparable.</p> <h3>Implementation notes</h3> <p><strong>ObjectBox:</strong> This release largely boosted the performance. The remaining bottlenecks are due to Dart itself and how it allows to modify byte buffers. There’s potential to double the speed if we look at other languages supported by ObjectBox. And if that’s not happening soon, we’d still have the option to do some low-level hacks…</p> <p><strong>Sqflite:</strong> a wrapper around SQLite, which is a relational database without direct support for Dart objects. Each dart object field is mapped to a column in the database, as per <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite#sql-helpers">sqflite docs</a>, i.e. converting between the Dart class and a Map.</p> <p><strong>Hive:</strong> We’ve tested with the latest Hive release, which is <a href="https://github.com/hivedb/hive/issues/246">technically discontinued</a>. The author hit two architectural roadblocks (RAM usage and queries) and is currently in the process to do a rewrite from scratch.<br><strong>Update:</strong> strictly speaking it’s not straightforward to directly compare e.g. ObjectBox vs. Hive. In Hive, the high read numbers result from Dart objects already cached in memory. If the objects are fetched using the async API from disk, the numbers drop by factor 1000.</p> <p><strong>Firestore:</strong> This is totally apples and oranges, but we still decided to include Firebase/Firestore as it seems at least somewhat popular to “persist data”. It’s quite Cloud centric and thus offers limited offline features. For example, in order to use batches (“transactions”), an internet connection is required to “commit”. Also, due to its low performance, the test configuration was different: batches of 500 objects and only 10 runs.</p> <h3>Test setup</h3> <p>We ran the benchmarks as a Flutter app on a Android 10 device with a Kirin 980 CPU. The app executed all operations in batches of 10.000 objects, with each batch forming a single transaction. Each test was run 50 times, averaging the results over all the runs. This ensured the VM warmup (optimization) during the first run and garbage collections don’t affect the overall result significantly. (We care about accurate benchmarks; <a href="https://objectbox.io/how-to-benchmark-database-performance-and-objectbox/">read more about our benchmarking best practices here.</a>)</p> <h2>Outlook</h2> <p>With this latest release, we’re not far away from a stable API for a 1.0 release (<strong>🎉</strong>), so please share your thoughts and feedback. For the next release, we’ll add features like async operations, more relation types and some smaller improvements. We are also working on an <a href="https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/issues/185"><strong>ObjectBox variant for the Web platform</strong></a> that is planned close to the 1.0 release. And of course there is <a href="https://objectbox.io/sync/">ObjectBox Data Sync</a> for Flutter/Dart. If you want to be first in line to try, <a href="mailto:contact@objectbox.io">drop us a line</a>, we can put you on the shortlist.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>From each of our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineboulanger/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two</a>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experiences</a> starting out as introductory-level engineers at Box, to becoming first-time managers overseeing five-person teams, then directors overseeing 30-50, and ultimately VPs managing hundreds, we've experienced software engineering from every angle.</p>
<p>At every step of the way, we asked ourselves: "how do we know if we are bringing value as engineering leaders?" Effective leadership uniquely blends human qualities - influence, empathy, courage, and <strong>results</strong>. This latter quality always brings the question of productivity - how effective are you at producing results through enabling others?</p>
<p>Since the advent of the software industry, most engineering teams have seen productivity as a black box. Only recently have people even begun to build internal tools that optimize performance. Unfortunately, most of these tools measure the wrong metrics and are shockingly similar across companies. We even built some of these tools and made mistakes. Now, we'd like to share the way forward.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="engineering-effectiveness-is-behind-the-times">Engineering Effectiveness is Behind the TimesÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Engineering teams are both the most expensive and most fundamental part of tech companies. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-company-is-now-a-tech-company-1543901207" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more companies become tech-enabled</a>, the importance of engineering will only increase. Yet today, a full three decades after the advent of the internet, most engineering departments still rely exclusively on qualitative signals of performance.</p>
<p><strong>The evolution of engineering effectiveness is paralleling the spirit of sales' recent transformation</strong>. In the early 2000s, sales was considered an art, so sales leaders could skate by on charisma alone. Today, with tools like <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://www.clari.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clari</a>, and <a href="https://people.ai/get-demo/?utm_campaign=demorequest&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_term=se-goog-1089&amp;utm_content=demorequest&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxp-ABhALEiwAXm6Iye9qQZaeojCPMvXn73zi-TRqbT93l7waQz3_uSadhOtpXncm8OLtvBoClTkQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">People.ai</a>, sales has fully executed the transition toward scientific, metric-based leadership for analyzing and improving performance.</p>
<p>In the coming years, engineering will adopt a similar, data-driven mode of management. In making this transition, however, most engineering teams are making these mistakes:</p>
<h3 id="mistake-1-measuring-approximations-of-output">Mistake #1: Measuring Approximations of Output</h3>
<p>In their haste to become more data-driven, many engineering leaders are measuring their team's performance based on metrics intended to approximate output. <strong>These metrics fail because they encourage engineers to game the system.</strong></p>
<p>If you measure a fixed metric like lines of code or number of tickets closed, your engineers will begin splitting code into more lines or breaking bug fixes into multiple tickets. Even sprint points, which attempt to convert engineering work into a standard unit, suffer from this pitfall: Some engineers will slow down after reaching their sprint points for the week while others will strategically inflate their tasks to be awarded additional points.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced engineers will recognize that this type of measurement is fake</strong>. While they may not be as influenced to "play the game," their morale will plummet and they will self-select out. By rewarding approximated metrics of output, you're encouraging engineers to increase them regardless of how they correlate with software development success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter which metrics you choose, abstract output approximations will distract engineers from their actual jobs, ultimately decreasing both your team's effectiveness and morale.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mistake-2-not-measuring-anything">Mistake #2: Not Measuring Anything</h3>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum sit engineering leaders who avoid measurement entirely. Many of these leaders have heard about the dangers of measuring the wrong metrics and therefore <strong>ricochet to the other extreme</strong>. They may emphasize the artisanal and social dimensions of engineering, claiming "software engineering is too complex to measure."</p>
<p>Non-measurement can even be self-reinforcing, because it places the leader into the position of being "the good guy." Instead of being a metrics-obsessed big brother, the leader can be the <strong>friendly older brother exclusively focused on keeping their team happy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Non-measurement fails because it prioritizes politics over productivity.</strong> If you don't measure any metrics, your engineering leaders will simply justify failures, telling stories like "The customer didn't give us the right requirements" or "We were surprised by unexpected vacations." Software development is complex enough that something always goes wrong; if you don't measure any data, you're at the mercy of individual stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-measurement unfairly rewards people with charisma while productive but less-persuasive engineers wallow in frustration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point, your top performers will see through these political machinations and quit because your culture lacks accountability.</p>
<p>In the short term, non-measurement can have a positive effect on team morale but it destroys morale in the long-term, especially among high performers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-measure-blockers-at-the-team-level">The Solution: Measure Blockers at the Team LevelÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Instead of measuring some approximation of engineering output, software teams should measure actual, observable metrics that directly correlate to effectiveness.</p>
<p>Productivity is a relationship between inputs and output. In software development, the inputs are a blend of factors--technical, individual, human, etc.--while the output should be functional software that creates value for customers. <strong>Productivity in engineering therefore naturally increases when you remove the blockers getting in the way of your team.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-you-should-measure-blockers">Why You Should Measure Blockers</h3>
<p>Even at the beginning of the software revolution, there existed the notion that engineers should be nurtured. Starting with Microsoft in the '80s, tech companies gave engineers free resources (like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/free-food-silicon-valley-tech-employees-apple-google-facebook-2018-7#google-has-so-much-free-food-employees-worry-about-gaining-the-google-15-4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">food</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-amazing-health-and-fitness-benefits-2019-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gyms</a>) that would remove blockers to their work. Empirical management practices over the last forty years have reinforced the importance of "<a href="https://www.axelos.com/news/blogs/january-2020/the-importance-of-servant-leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">servant leadership</a>" and "<a href="https://www.mugo.ca/Blog/The-most-important-web-project-management-skill-the-ability-to-unblock-others" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unblocking your team</a>," while <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/2020-state-of-devops-report/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent research</a> emphasizes the importance of optimized inputs and best practices.</p>
<p>For engineers, these inputs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality of developer tools</li>
<li>Frequency and quality of internal activities (like meetings or code reviews)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focused <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maker time</a> (free from disruptive meetings)</li>
<li>Easy access to documentation</li>
<li>Psychological safety on the team</li>
<li>Work-life balance</li>
<li>Presence of other high-performersÂ&nbsp;</li>
<li>A fair system of rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>The blockers to these inputs already exist and can be quantified, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much free, uninterrupted time does an engineer have to code?</li>
<li>How long is an engineer waiting on a response from another engineer's review?</li>
<li>How often do dev tools get in the way instead of helping accelerate work?Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>How often are engineers required to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">context switch</a>, preventing <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deep work</a>?</li>
<li>How often do engineers receive pages outside of business hours, interrupting their sleep or family life?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An engineering leader exists to enable their team to achieve their goals.</strong> Together, these quantified blockers allow engineering leaders to answer key questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is preventing the engineers from building faster?</li>
<li>What issues are arising in real time?Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>What technology or process investments would increase team engagement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each engineering team is unique, so its blockers will be specific. It's not so simple as "more maker time is better." If your engineering team is new or temporarily misaligned on key goals, more meeting time might be the answer. What never changes is the need for measurement and well-considered, deliberate decisions.</p>
<p>Over the last year, COVID-19 has helped demonstrate the value of measuring blockers. For many leaders running newly remote teams, <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/remote-work-challenges-solutions/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new blockers have arisen</a> that would never have been noticed if managers were only focusing on the desired outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your team is full of competent, driven engineers, removing their blockers is the fastest way to enable forward movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-team-is-the-right-level-to-improve">Why "Team" is the Right Level to Improve</h3>
<p>Since software development requires complex interaction between team members, it would be inappropriate to assign individuals their own metrics: Some engineers are effective individual contributors while others enable their teammates to perform. Engineers also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/okay-nabs-funding-from-sequoia-to-build-performance-dashboards-for-engineering-managers/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hate being micromanaged</a>, so tracking individual activity can make them feel untrusted.</p>
<p><strong>Just as a sports team wins or loses together, so too should the engineering team be treated as the fundamental unit of success.</strong></p>
<p>Approaching engineering at the team level also places the proper accountability on the manager. It raises helpful questions like "What behaviors, structures, and work habits are preventing us from succeeding?"</p>
<p>Looking at the team level also enables managers to catch blockers as they evolve. Small issues, for instance, may not be apparent when the company is young, but can evolve into 10,000 papercuts only apparent at the team level. If code reviews take days instead of hours, at first one engineer complains, then two, then three... and if you don't pay attention, years later the engineering culture is shot. By compiling these small quantifications and observing their trends, a manager can understand whether a report is one individual's experience or truly relevant to the overall performance of the team.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, if blockers follow a constant evolution (e.g. one person is often the canary in the coalmine), an engineering leader can map how the new blockers are likely to evolve and prioritize which should be solved first.</p>
<p>Just as an airplane pilot must monitor dozens of different metrics to keep the plane flying, so too would an engineering leader benefit from viewing their team's metrics to understand overall performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an optimal engineering dashboard, a leader would be able to assess the blockers that prevent the ultimate success of their team.Â&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="toward-engineering-effectiveness">Toward Engineering EffectivenessÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>"Productivity" is an appropriate measure for someone making widgets at a factory: "How many products did you produce in an hour?"</p>
<p>Engineering should instead be about effectiveness: "How able is this engineer to effect positive impact?"</p>
<p>Looking forward, engineering effectiveness will have three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measuring the experience of engineering teams in their most frequent activities. (Think<a href="https://www.scalyr.com/blog/distributed-tracing-important-2019/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> distributed tracing</a>, but for human activities.)</li>

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/">https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/</a></p>
<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#what-automation">https://pluralistic.net/2020/03/24/grandparents-optional-party/#what-automation</a></p>
<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>This is what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype," criticism that actually builds on – and depends on – maintaining the halo of devastating potency that surrounds overhyped technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>2018 was almost the year we won the Right to Repair.</p>
<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf</a></p>
<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution">https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution</a></p>
<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again</a></p>
<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>
<p>The conversion of London into a …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Students in Foshan, Guangdong Province, play rope skipping after class. File&nbsp;Photo: VCG</p><p>Chinese education authority has recently vowed to enhance physical education and psychological direction in a response to a previous proposal from a top policy advisor calling on the country to strengthen "masculinity" education for boys, which has ignited heated debate on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal has won some support, while many on the internet believe it might lead to gender stereotyping. Experts noted that the goals of education should be to train students to be more responsible, and called for a more tolerant and diversified evaluation system for children.</p><p>In a Thursday reply to the proposal on "avoiding feminization of teenage boys," the Chinese Ministry of Education said it will solve the problems from several aspects including enhancing the research on issues related to youth mental health education.</p><p>In May 2020, during the national Two Sessions, Si Zefu, a member of the Standing Committee of the 13th CPPCC National Committee and chairman of Harbin Electric Corporation, said that the "feminization" trend of Chinese teenagers, if not managed effectively, will harm the existence and development of China. "Many Chinese teenage boys nowadays have the characteristics of weakness, low self-esteem and timidity, and they tend to follow the pretty-boy superstars," said Si.&nbsp;</p><p>Si believed this phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that most teachers in schools from kindergarten to high school stage are women, as well as to the frequent appearance of "pretty boys" in TV and films.</p><p>The reply from the Ministry of Education triggered a widespread discussion on the internet over the weekend. The related hashtag has been viewed more than 2 billion times with 250,000 comments as of press time on Sina Weibo.</p><p>Discussions focus on what "masculinity" is and what the boys really need in education.</p><p>"It is a beauty for men to show their toughness in demeanor, spirit, and physique… Education is not only meant to foster 'men' and 'women,' but also duty and responsibility," read a CCTV editorial on Sunday.</p><p>"The anxiety about lack of 'masculinity' is itself a discrimination due to certain kind of mindset. In subconsciousness, such people consider 'female', 'girly' and 'feminine' are bad and each sex should have a certain kind of look in life," noted an editorial on iFeng.com. "Why doesn't the Ministry of Education worry that more physical exercise will make girls too 'masculine?'"</p><p>Sun Yunxiao, an education expert, was quoted by the CNR as saying that while it is true some boys are relatively 'weak,' and the situation calls for attention, people's 'temperaments' are naturally diversified and there is nothing good or bad about it. "We should not attach stereotypes to sexes."</p><p>"Girls could be tough, and boys could be gentle," he said.</p><p>"If masculinity means a boy should not cry, then it is a stereotype," Yu Ka, a primary school teacher in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times.</p><p>But Yu also shared his observation that some boys are not as tough as many girls among her students. "I feel boys are too spoiled by families and the society," Yu said, pointing to the traditional mindset of valuing boys.</p><p>Chu Zhaohui, a research fellow at China's National Institute of Education Sciences, called for a diversified evaluation system. "Currently, evaluation is based on scores to a large extent. Even if boys perform well in areas other than learning, they won't get much appreciation. For many boys, they cannot do what they want to do, which is not conducive to cultivating independence, courage and perseverance," Chu told the Global Times.</p><p>"Masculinity means having a relatively strong sense of independence, willpower and perseverance, including physical fitness," Chu said.</p><p>"We should leave it to the nature of the person. We have destroyed the natural state of students and what we need to do now is to correct it and let them return to normal and be more natural," Chu said.</p></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>TypeScript and JavaScript have steadily evolved over the last years, and some of the habits we built over the last decades have become obsolete. Some might never have been meaningful. Here's a list of 10 habits that we all should break.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more articles and news about web product development and entrepreneurship, please feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%253A%252F%252Fstartup-cto.net%252F&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;region=follow_link&amp;screen_name=The_Startup_CTO&amp;tw_p=followbutton">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Onto the examples! Please note that each "What it should look like" only fixes the issue discussed, even if there are further code smells that should be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="1notusingstrictmode">1. Not using <code>strict</code> mode</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Using a <code>tsconfig.json</code> without strict mode.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Just enable <code>strict</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Introducing stricter rules in an existing codebase takes time.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Stricter rules will make it easier to change code in the future, so the time spent on fixing the code is returned and then some when working on the repository in the future.</p>
<h2 id="2definingdefaultvalueswith">2. Defining default values with <code>||</code></h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Falling back with <code>||</code> for optional values:</p>
<pre><code>function createBlogPost (text: string, author: string, date?: Date) {
  return {
    text: text,
    author: author,
    date: date || new Date()
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Use the new <code>??</code> operator, or, even better, define the fallback right at the parameter level.</p>
<pre><code>function createBlogPost (text: string, author: string, date: Date = new Date())
  return {
    text: text,
    author: author,
    date: date
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>The <code>??</code> operator has just been introduced last year, and when using values in the middle of a long function it might be hard to set them already as parameter defaults.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p><code>??</code>, unlike <code>||</code>, falls back only for <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, not for all falsy values. Also, if your functions are so long that you cannot define defaults at the beginning, then splitting them might be a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="3usinganyastype">3. Using <code>any</code> as type</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Using <code>any</code> for data when you are unsure about the structure.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: any = await response.json()
  return products
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>In almost every situation where you type something as <code>any</code>, you should type it as <code>unknown</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  return products as Product[]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p><code>any</code> is convenient, as it basically disables all type-checks. Often, <code>any</code> is used even in official typings (e. g. <code>response.json()</code> from the example above is typed as <code>Promise&lt;any&gt;</code> by the TypeScript team).</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>It basically disables all type-checks. Anything that comes in via <code>any</code> will completely forego any type-checks. This leads to hard to catch bugs, as code will fail only when our assumptions about type structure are relevant to the runtime code.</p>
<h2 id="4valassometype">4. <code>val as SomeType</code></h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Forcefully telling the compiler about a type that it cannot infer.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  return products as Product[]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>That's what type guards are for.</p>
<pre><code>function isArrayOfProducts (obj: unknown): obj is Product[] {
  return Array.isArray(obj) &amp;&amp; obj.every(isProduct)
}

function isProduct (obj: unknown): obj is Product {
  return obj != null
    &amp;&amp; typeof (obj as Product).id === 'string'
}

async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  if (!isArrayOfProducts(products)) {
    throw new TypeError('Received malformed products API response')
  }
  return products
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>When converting from JavaScript to TypeScript, the existing codebase often makes assumptions about types that cannot be deduced automatically by the TypeScript compiler. In these cases, throwing in a quick <code>as SomeOtherType</code> can speed up the conversion without having to loosen the settings in tsconfig.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Even if the assertion might be save right now, this might change when someone moves code around. The type guard will ensure that all checks are explicit.</p>
<h2 id="5asanyintests">5. <code>as any</code> in tests</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Creating incomplete stand-ins when writing tests.</p>
<pre><code>interface User {
  id: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

test('createEmailText returns text that greats the user by first name', () =&gt; {
  const user: User = {
    firstName: 'John'
  } as any
  
  expect(createEmailText(user)).toContain(user.firstName)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>If you need to mock data for your tests, move the mocking logic next to the thing you mock and make it reusable.</p>
<pre><code>interface User {
  id: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

class MockUser implements User {
  id = 'id'
  firstName = 'John'
  lastName = 'Doe'
  email = 'john@doe.com'
}

test('createEmailText returns text that greats the user by first name', () =&gt; {
  const user = new MockUser()

  expect(createEmailText(user)).toContain(user.firstName)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>When writing tests in a codebase that doesn't have great test coverage yet, there are often complicated big data structures, but only parts of it are needed for the specific functionality under test. Not having to worry about the other properties is easier in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Foregoing the creation of a mock will bite us, latest when one of the properties changes and we need to change it in all tests instead of one central location. Also, there will be situations where the code under test relies on properties that we did not deem important before, and then all tests for that functionality need to be updated.</p>
<h2 id="6optionalproperties">6. Optional properties</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Marking properties as optional that are sometimes there and sometimes not.</p>
<pre><code>interface Product {
  id: string
  type: 'digital' | 'physical'
  weightInKg?: number
  sizeInMb?: number
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly model which combinations exist and which don't.</p>
<pre><code>interface Product {
  id: string
  type: 'digital' | 'physical'
}

interface DigitalProduct extends Product {
  type: 'digital'
  sizeInMb: number
}

interface PhysicalProduct extends Product {
  type: 'physical'
  weightInKg: number
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Marking properties as optional instead of splitting out types is easier and produces less code. It also requires a deeper understanding of the product being build and might limit usage of code if assumptions about the product change.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>The big benefit of type systems is that they can replace runtime checks with compile-time checks. With more explicit typing, it is possible to get compile-time checks for bugs that otherwise might have gotten unnoticed, e. g. by making sure that every <code>DigitalProduct</code> has a <code>sizeInMb</code>.</p>
<h2 id="7onelettergenerics">7. One letter generics</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Naming a generic with one letter</p>
<pre><code>function head&lt;T&gt; (arr: T[]): T | undefined {
  return arr[0]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Giving a full descriptive type name.</p>
<pre><code>function head&lt;Element&gt; (arr: Element[]): Element | undefined {
  return arr[0]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>This habit grew I guess because <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html">even the official docs use one-letter names</a>. It is also quicker to type and requires less thinking to press <code>T</code> instead of writing a full name.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Generic type variables are variables, like any other. We have abandoned the idea of describing the technicalities of variables in their names when IDEs started to just show us these technicalities. E. g. instead of <code>const strName = 'Daniel'</code> we now only write <code>const name = 'Daniel'</code>. Also, one letter variable names are generally frowned upon because it can be hard to decipher what they mean without looking at their declaration.</p>
<h2 id="8nonbooleanbooleanchecks">8. Non-boolean boolean checks</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Checking whether a value is defined by passing the value directly to an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly checking for the condition we care about.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages !== undefined) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Writing the check in short looks more succinct and allows us to avoid thinking about what we actually want to check.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Maybe we should think about what we actually want to check. The examples above for example handle the case of <code>countOfNewMessages</code> being <code>0</code> differently.</p>
<h2 id="9thebangbangoperator">9. The Bang Bang operator</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Converting a non-boolean value to boolean.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (!!countOfNewMessages) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly checking for the condition we care about.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages !== undefined) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>To some, understanding <code>!!</code> is like an initiation ritual to the world of JavaScript. It looks short and succinct, and if you are already used to it, then you know what it is about. It is a shortcut to convert any value to a boolean. Especially if, in a codebase, there is no clear semantic separation between falsy values like <code>nu…</code></p></section></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a> as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion, hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund, Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a> Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). Another fund, Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over 100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store, Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their 24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions, covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment, and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a> of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However, much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a> such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a> the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts, leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized, centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016. Social media was fingered as the main culprit in an “insurrection” that attempted to overthrow an election. And now, WallStreetBets is accused …</p></div></div>

            <p>Kubernetes is one the largest and fastest growing open-source projects. Since its inception in 2014, Kubernetes received tens of thousands of contributions from the community, and enhanced by plethora of new tools. But that doesn’t come without its downsides. Namely, every now and then, there’s a tool that doesn’t adhere to Kubernetes core principles, and I think one such tool is <em>Helm</em>.</p>

<p>I have tried for so long to understand why Kubernetes community chooses Helm over the other tools, especially given my experience with a tool that has some similar features to it (as you’ll see later). To finally get some insight, I decided to write this blog post to learn more about Helm and its community.</p>

<p>If you search on Google for Kubernetes principles, you are unlikely to find <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/principles.md">this document</a>. While the principles outlined are very succinct, most of Kubernetes developers could probably talk about each of these ideas at length. One such <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIQurh_kDk">talk</a>, although probably not exhaustive, comes from <a href="https://github.com/saad-ali">Saad Ali</a> at KubeCon. If you’re not deeply familiar with Kubernetes, I highly suggest to give it a listen before you read the rest of the text. Now without delaying any further, here are the principles mentioned in the talk, and why I think Helm breaks <em>some</em> of these principles<em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kubernetes APIs are declarative rather than imperative.</li>
<li>The Kubernetes control plane is transparent. There are no hidden internal APIs.</li>
<li>Meet the user where they are.</li>
<li>Workload portability.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the very first examples mentioned in the talk is about the downsides of client-side. Many of the same problems presented for scripting on the cluster is introduced by Helm as well. What if your machine dies? What if you lose connection? What if your colleague runs the same command at the same time? But also, what if you run a wrong version of Helm? The answer is - you’re possibly going to be in an inconsistent state between two versions. The underlying cause of it is that Helm workflow is imperative, and not declarative. As opposed to using kubectl + Kustomize, for example, whose joint job is to declare the new state of the Kubernetes cluster, Helm can be used to manage the lifecycle of the objects, and apply them in certain order - most notably with hooks.</p>

<p>When I mentioned lifecycle, I immediately thought of only one thing - Kubernetes control plane. As you’ll see in the related talk, it’s quite clear that only lifecycle managers should be <em>controllers</em>, and they should run inside the cluster itself. Strong push for server-side is most evident in recently introduced <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/">Server Side Apply (SSA)</a>, which is trying to fix some of the issues with kubectl by removing one of the last pieces of code that are running client-side.</p>



<p>One of my favourite features of Kubernetes is its transparency. Everything goes through a single endpoint, and everything is available to all parties (with right access permissions). This means that I can start using new piece of software for Kubernetes and inspect what it’s doing to the cluster. That’s why when I think about working with Kubernetes, I mostly think about using kubectl.</p>

<p>With Helm, this is rather different. It is actively trying to hide what it’s doing by providing abstractions between you and the actual state of the cluster. This comes in two forms - CLI and Charts. The former creates new concepts of working with the cluster, that are not consistent with declarative intent of Kubernetes project. Instead of declaring the state of the cluster, it introduces additional <em>commands</em> to describe <em>how</em> to get to desired state of the cluster, also further violating the first principle. More importantly, both hide the information about what Kubernetes objects are being changed on the cluster. Charts especially encourage users to ignore underlying Kubernetes objects by providing additional parameterization abstraction over them. This inevitably ends up being restrictive for end users who want to change fields that are not parametrized by Helm and thus cannot be changed without creating your own copy of the Chart.</p>



<p>One of the early problems of Kubernetes was that its API was pretty verbose and static. Since Kubernetes didn’t meet users with any solution at that time, it prompted many of them (including me) to try something different other than using pure kubectl &amp; YAML. Roughly four years ago, at the time when I was first faced with this problem, I was just at the start of my journey with Ansible. Having not too much experience with Kubernetes, and seeing how much Ansible is flexible and given that it already had the support for interfacing with Kubernetes, I decided to give Ansible and its Jinja templating a try. Things didn’t work out so great.</p>

<p>A year later, I learned about Helm which aimed to solve this same (and more). The trouble is, to me it looked exactly like Jinja. It used a similar structure-unaware templating engine to generate structured data. Most notably, the engine is partially unaware of indents needed to create YAML structures. So, in order to make generated document properly indented, you need to resort to ugly hacks like <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/d792245e710ef759578bbbe956ec1e01efc27af4/stable/airflow/templates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml#L193">explicitly specifying number of indents</a> or <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/d792245e710ef759578bbbe956ec1e01efc27af4/stable/airflow/templates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml#L220">prefixing blocks with whitespace truncation</a>. And this really felt like trying to put Legos together with glue, all the while being blindfolded. Since then, Helm was supposed to get Lua support which would address the drawbacks of using a general purpose templating engine, but it hasn’t happened yet. Even if it did at some point, bringing Lua as addition only, without deprecating the current templating engine, won’t solve the original problem.</p>

<p>Everything about Helm seems to me like an “obvious solution” (as Saad Ali put it) to the problem of deploying workloads on Kubernetes. Just like my first approach, it gave <em>an</em> answer to “What” to do about this problem, but not the “Why” it’s done that way. The currently used Go templating engine, used to generate Helm manifests, could’ve easily been Jinja, if the project was started in Python. Or even simpler, it could’ve been Python itself with no extra libraries to generate structured YAML outputs from dicts.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there seems to be much better tools for composing pieces of structured data. <a href="https://kustomize.io/">Kustomize</a>, <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">jsonnet</a>, <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>, <a href="https://carvel.dev/ytt/">ytt</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> are just some of the tools that are simply better fitted for the job. Similar goes for managing the lifecycle of the applications. Kubernetes, for example, has built-in controllers for managing deployments and statefulsets. These might not fit your use-case, and you certainly don’t have to agree with how they are implemented, but you’re entirely free to build your own <a href="https://book.kubebuilder.io/">controller</a>/<a href="https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/">operator</a> to manage lifecycle of your apps in a different way. However, Helm has chosen to stay client side. Something that’s increasingly moved away from, and most obvious with the addition of SSA.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-long-time-kubernetes-users-the-other-way">Meeting long-time Kubernetes users the other way</h2>

<p>On a similar topic, whilst Kubernetes tried its best to build the tools in place to make the new users feel welcome, Helm did not seem to bother trying to apply the same principle for existing Kubernetes users. I previously mentioned how Helm binary is trying to replace kubectl. As a long time Kubernetes user and operator, I really (and I mean <em>reallyyyyyy…</em>) have gotten used to be able to view transparent APIs through the single lens of kubectl to debug and solve issues. Helm instead takes this power away from you, and fragments the ecosystem.</p>



<p>To get a sense whether the Helm project is at least going in the right direction of correcting some of the design flaws I mentioned above, I looked at some of the new features they’re adding. Two of them are chart values validation, and a post renderer. While you might argue that both of these features are very useful (and I wouldn’t dare to deny that), both of them seem to be breaking either the Kubernetes design or engineering principles.</p>

<h2 id="post-renderer">Post-renderer</h2>

<p>The post-renderer comes as a solution to the problem that Helm itself introduced. Helm charts that are published are not fully customisable by the users. This is because Helm broke one of the key ideas of Kubernetes and decided to hide and abstract Kubernetes objects away from the users. To solve this issue, the Helm project introduced <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering">post-rendering feature</a>. While I was initially excited about the idea of Helm embracing configuration engines other than Go templating (such as Kustomize, which is explicitly mentioned in the docs), the feature still doesn’t fully adhere to some of the same core ideas of the Kubernetes project. Specifically speaking, post-rendering is not a declarative feature. You cannot specify in code that a post-render must be used to install a particular Helm chart. Rather, it relies on manually specifying the correct flag on issuing the helm command, and thus breaks declarative intent of configuration management.</p>

<p>​​It’s even more important to note that this feature goes directly against the core idea of Helm - abstraction. If you want to use post-rendering, you probably need to be intimately familiar with the templates of the upstream Chart. Even though such move is welcome to a certain extent, Helm design clearly continues to prioritize abstraction over transparent APIs and additionally introduces some very puzzling and contradictory design.</p>

<h2 id="chart-values-validation">Chart values validation</h2>

<p>One of the most prominent features of Helm Charts is the ability to abstract away configuration of Kubernetes objects and instead give the user the ability to provide high-level settings they would like to set for their installation of the particular Chart. These high-level settings are configured in the shape of a free-form YAML document. Unfortunately, free-form YAML is not exactly best suited for providing parameters with predefined structure. If you want to change anything about your deployment, the usual way to do so is to look up the default values (present in the Helm Chart), and then specify overrides for what you want to change. But default values are not …</p></div></div>

        <p>BASIC programs often contain machine code routines but they take up quite a lot of space in BASIC.  An interesting way to reduce the amount of space that they take is to store the machine code in <code>REM</code> statements.  This is much more compact and also means that we can call the routine directly from the location it is stored in memory rather than having to copy it to a further location.  This doesn't just apply to machine code, we could also do this for storing other data such as a custom character set.</p>
<h2>How BASIC is Stored in Memory</h2>
<p>A BASIC program consists of a series of BASIC lines followed by two 00 octets to signify the end of the program. The BASIC statements are condensed using tokens such as $8F for <code>REM</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/vic20_machine_code_in_data_statements_basic_listing.png" title="BASIC listing with machine in DATA statements"></p><p>A machine code routine in BASIC is often stored in <code>DATA</code> statements and then copied to another area of memory for execution.  However, this uses up more memory than storing the routine in <code>REM</code> statements as we will see later.</p>
<p>The following BASIC program copies a machine code routine stored in <code>DATA</code> statements into locations 673-692.  The machine language routine we're using cycles the screen border and background colours and is from the article: <a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/hand-assembling-to-machine-code-on-the-commodore-vic-20/">Hand Assembling to Machine Code on the Commodore VIC-20</a>.</p>

<h2>Storing Machine Code in REM Statements</h2>
<p>The machine code routine stored in <code>DATA</code> statements above is position independent and is represented by the following octets which we can also see in the table below.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>On an unexpanded Vic, BASIC programs start at $1001 (4097).  We would use a different location for Vics with more memory.  To create a <code>REM</code> statement with the above machine code we would enter the following in memory.  We could easily <code>POKE</code> the values from BASIC into memory starting at location 4097 ($1001) or we could use a simple hex loader or a machine language monitor.</p>

<p>After we have entered the line into memory we must remember to update locations 45/46 to indicate the end of our BASIC program and the start of variables.</p>
<br>
<h3>Using VICMON to Create REM Statement Containing Machine Code</h3>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/vic20_vicmon_code_in_rem_basic_listing.png" title="BASIC listing with machine embedded in REM statement, entered using VICMON"></p><p>If we have a machine language monitor, such as VICMON, then the process is really easy.  We just alter the bytes in memory, exit to BASIC, update the end of BASIC program pointer and then enter our <code>SYS</code> statement on the following line.</p>

<p>In VICMON we first have to enable a virtual zero page otherwise the monitor would overwrite bytes in memory necessary for BASIC.</p>
<pre><code>.E 1200
</code></pre>
<p>Enter BASIC <code>REM</code> lines containing machine code at location $1001 (4097), the start of BASIC on an unexpanded Vic.</p>
<pre><code>.M 1001
.:1001 1C 10 0A 00 8F
.:1006 20 AD 0F 90 A2
.:100B FF 8E 0F 90 A0
.:1010 FF 88 D0 FD CA
.:1015 D0 F5 8D 0F 90
.:101A 60 00 00 00
</code></pre>
<p>Exit to BASIC.</p>
<pre><code>.X
</code></pre>
<p>Move the pointer to end of BASIC program, which is the next location after the end of the BASIC program marker.  This is stored in LSB MSB order and here is $101E (4126).</p>
<pre><code>POKE 45, 30
POKE 46, 16
</code></pre>
<p>Add line to jump to the machine code contained in the <code>REM</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>20 SYS4103
</code></pre>
<h2>Memory Use Comparison</h2>
<p>The following BASIC statement shows how much memory is free for BASIC programs.</p>
<pre><code>PRINT FRE(0)
</code></pre>
<p>On an unexpanded Vic, that has just been switched on, it shows 3581 bytes free.</p>
<p>The following table shows how much memory is used by the two programs above.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Program Version</th><th>Memory free (bytes)</th><th>Usage (bytes)</th></tr>
  <tr><td>DATA statements</td><td>3460</td><td>121</td></tr>
  <tr><td>REM statement</td><td>3544</td><td>37</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>We can see from this table that the version of the program that stored the machine code routine in a <code>REM</code> statement used 84 bytes less memory than the one that stored the routine in <code>DATA</code> statements.  It also saved using up memory at 673-692 which could possibly be used for something else.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This method is a great way to save memory in BASIC programs, however it isn't without its problems.  The machine code routine can't contain a <code>00</code> byte as this indicates the end of the BASIC line.  It isn't suitable for listings and it is a pain if we want to alter the machine code stored in the <code>REM</code> statements.  Despite this, it is an interesting method which gives us some incite into how BASIC is stored in memory and can be useful in certain situations.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following video shows a machine code routine being entered into both <code>DATA</code> statements and <code>REM</code> statements.  It also shows the code being run directly from the area in memory where it is embedded within the <code>REM</code> statement.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One question I'm often asked is what metadata <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow">Matrix</a> leaks. It does get tiring answering the same questions, so I'm creating an article I can simply link to any time someone asks.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am on record many times saying Matrix leaks metadata. However, one thing that many people fail to understand is exactly what Matrix leaks, and why.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this article, it's assumed users are communicating using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). In non-E2EE rooms, you can expect everything mentioned here to be leaked, as well as actual message contents.</em></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-metadata-leak">What is a metadata leak?</h3>

<p>Metadata leaks are when your messaging app includes <a href="https://ia801306.us.archive.org/28/items/content-metadata-matrix/content-metadata-matrix_text.pdf" rel="nofollow">metadata</a> in a way that's not encrypted end-to-end. This includes the dates and times you send messages, who you send them to, how frequently you send messages, and more. Many messengers allow you to set status messages and profile pictures. These are not encrypted, and are thus leaked. The issue with metadata leaks is they can fairly easily <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/your-phone-metadata-is-more-revealing-than-you-think" rel="nofollow">reveal sensitive information</a>, even when you don't expect them to.</p>

<h3 id="what-metadata-does-matrix-leak">What metadata does Matrix leak?</h3>

<p>Matrix supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This protects the contents of messages, such that nobody can read them except the intended recipients. E2EE can be enabled manually in Matrix rooms, but is also enabled by default in 1:1 chats (DMs). Some clients may not enable E2EE by default,  so you should always verify whether messages are sent E2EE.</p>

<p>Matrix's E2EE does not, however, encrypt everything. The following information is not encrypted:</p>
<ul><li>Message senders
<ul><li>Message senders are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Session/device IDs
<ul><li>Due to Matrix's design, encrypting this would break verification</li></ul></li>
<li>Message timestamps
<ul><li>It's impossible to prevent timestamps from leaking, since the server can simply note when an event is received anyway</li></ul></li>
<li>Room members (join/leave/invite events)
<ul><li>Join/leave/invite and other room events are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Message edit events
<ul><li>While contents are not leaked, an attacker can know when messages are edited</li></ul></li>
<li>Message reactions
<ul><li>Reactions are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Read receipts
<ul><li>Read receipts are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Nicknames
<ul><li>Nicknames are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Profile pictures
<ul><li>Profile pictures are never encrypted</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>To demonstrate some examples of these leaks, I have made some examples available: <a href="https://snippets.serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix-metadata-leaks" rel="nofollow">https://snippets.serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix-metadata-leaks</a></p>

<h3 id="who-can-view-metadata">Who can view metadata?</h3>

<p>The following metadata can be seen by any homeserver with at least 1 member in an E2EE room:</p>
<ul><li>Message senders</li>
<li>Session/device IDs</li>
<li>Message timestamps</li>
<li>Room members (join/leave/invite events)</li>
<li>Message edit events</li>
<li>Message reactions</li>
<li>Read receipts</li>
<li>Room-specific nicknames</li>

<p>The following information is publicly available:</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul><li>A room has 2 members, both from <em>homeserver1.example.com</em>. Any attacker with access to <em>homeserver1.example.com</em> can see metadata from that room. This includes homeserver admins, as well as anyone who manages to compromise the homeserver.</li>
<li>A room has 2 members, one from <em>homeserver1.example.com</em>, and another from <em>homeserver2.example.com</em>. Any attacker with access to <em>homeserver1.example.com</em> or <em>homeserver2.example.com</em> can see metadata from that room. This includes homeserver admins, as well as anyone who manages to compromise one (or more) of the homeservers.</li>
<li>I think you get the idea...</li></ul>

<h3 id="why-does-matrix-leak-metadata">Why does Matrix leak metadata?</h3>

<p>Federated networks are naturally more vulnerable to metadata leaks than P2P or centralized networks. These leaks can be fixed, at the expense of increased complexity of the protocol (thus making it more vulnerable to faulty implementations). Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is necessary for proper functioning of the protocol.</p>

<p>Some metadata must be leaked due to features Matrix provides. For example, Matrix's message verification requires knowing which user and device sent a message (to know which key to verify with). In other cases (such as global profile pictures and nicknames), the information is considered public anyway, and therefore has no need to be encrypted. Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is a triviality.</p>

<p>Some metadata leaks are accepted for performance requirements. For example, message reactions and read receipts might not be encrypted because Matrix's E2EE is slower than normal (non-E2EE) messaging. Encrypting reactions and read receipts could provide a painful user experience (UX). Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is a design feature.</p>

<p>Some metadata leaks are simply a matter of the protocol's failure to consider them. For example, room-specific nicknames, room-specific profile pictures, and message edit events could all be encrypted without breaking the protocol. Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is a design flaw.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Though edit events are leaked, message contents are not.</p>

After recovering from his poisoning in Germany, Navalny returned to Russia only to be arrested and imprisoned in Moscow.

When David and I prepared to launch Wilbur Labs in 2016, the startup studio model was still developing. There wasnâ€™t a standard approach, and the business model was unproven.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We had to rethink how companies should be built. We knew that the vast majority of startups fail, and that money alone canâ€™t build big businesses. As a result, we operate very differently from other investors, incubators, or accelerators in existence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We believe that organizational knowledge, or what we call studio knowledge, is far more valuable than capital. Each time we research an idea, solve a problem, launch a company, and learn from our successes and failures, we build on our studio knowledge. Studio knowledge collects, compounds, and carries through to all current and future portfolio companies. This uniquely allows our portfolio companies to move faster and further than is possible when raising capital through traditional sources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also realized that while many investors claim to provide operational support, in reality, this support is mostly limited to high-level advice. When building a startup, execution is everything. We needed to be on the ground floor to effectively help our portfolio companies build and grow. Whether itâ€™s setting up payroll, building a team, maintaining compliance, setting a product roadmap, or acquiring customers, our studio team of entrepreneurs has done this before, bringing battle-tested processes and learnings every step of the way. The end result is a better foundation for growth and fewer distractions for our portfolio company leadership teams, which can focus singularly on building great products for customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Three attributes differentiate Wilbur Labs from other investors or methods of building a company: our focus on building companies, providing shared resources across our portfolio to scale at an accelerated pace, and our operational involvement to help each business take off.<br></p></div><h2>A Company That Builds Companies</h2><div><p dir="ltr">Wilbur Labs focuses on turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. While we also invest and acquire existing companies, building from 0 to 1 is our core focus. Launching a startup is typically a one-time event, but at Wilbur Labs, <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">generating startup ideas</a>, then <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-turn-an-idea-into-a-business">turning those ideas into a business</a>, is a repeatable and standardized process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We identify big customer pain points and build businesses to solve these problems. After an idea is validated in the Lab, we bring in industry leaders with domain expertise to manage and grow the company. Wilbur Labs continues to provide funding, shared resources, and operational support to ensure management is focused on solving problems that matter.</p></div><h2>Shared Resources</h2><div><p dir="ltr">We have shared resources that allow for more rapid development and faster progression through the idea, launch, and growth stage. From playbooks to shared teams, processes, and infrastructure, these resources allow our companies to move faster than traditional companies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Distractions and lack of focus are responsible for killing many startups. At Wilbur Labs, we reduce time spent on non-core tasks by giving our companies access to shared resources, advisors, and domain experts. That way, the founding team can focus on solving core user and business problems.<br></p>
</div><h2>Operational Involvement</h2><div><p dir="ltr">Wilbur Labs is more operationally involved, especially early on, compared to accelerators or venture capital firms. We believe in â€œmore wood behind fewer arrows,â€� meaning we build fewer companies with more resources behind each one. By leaning on the experience and repeatable processes of our studio team â€” which launches multiple companies every year â€” weâ€™re able to reduce risk and expedite growth.</p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Over the years, as others have seen our companies grow at a rapid pace, we have commonly fielded the question, â€œwhat is your secret sauce?â€� The truth is that we focus on solving big problems better, and by doing so, our companies grow. No matter how far you dig into that question, you will never find a single secret sauce, piece of technology, strategy, playbook, tool, or person responsible for what we do best. Instead, digging further into that question will uncover our studio knowledge: 1,000+ processes, plans, decisions, people, playbooks, approaches, technologies, checklists, roadmaps, learnings, and values. Together, this studio knowledge allows us to solve bigger problems, faster, with reduced risk than would otherwise be possible.</p><p>We believe that dedicated, standalone teams are necessary to solve big problems over a long period of time. Our operational involvement is highest at the beginning and then drops as the companyâ€™s team and traction increases.</p></div>
</div><h2>WhatÊ¼s Next</h2><div><p dir="ltr">With our focus on solving big problems using shared studio resources, operational support, and studio knowledge, we still consider this day 1. Since 2016, we have built and invested in over 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, and <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and have several companies at the pre-launch stage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p>The other day somebody on reddit asked the age-old question: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/la1mz5/a_simple_question/">why didn't F# have typeclasses or functors?</a></p><p>That's a long discussion, but while reading replies, somebody mentioned this cool litte <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus">F#+ library.</a></p><p>Over to GitHub we go!</p><p>Over the years, as I've written more and more solutions in F#, I've come across stuff I wanted to do where it seemed as if I were fighting the language too much. Stuff like common conversions with strings. Turns out a lot of other people have those issues also, so folks started collecting little goodies here and there. You're coding along, and suddenly you realize you want to make sure that string is all lower case. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a method to automatically do that, something like "foo".toLower()?</p><p>As most every coder knows, that's already don. It's in there. But it's not just that one little method. During regular coding you run across all kinds of stuff that hasn't been coded. Let's say you want to put hyphens in a string (why, I don't know)</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Extensions
    let allCapsString = "I LIKE HYPHENS!"
    printfn "Extensions to core types"
    printfn "Original"
    printfn "%s" allCapsString
    let stickSomeHyphensInThere =  String.intersperse '-'
    printfn "Fixed"
    printfn "%s" (stickSomeHyphensInThere allCapsString)
    ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's trivial stuff, but damn stuff like that gets old. And it's not just trivial stuff. Let's you've got a list and you're expecting only one element in it. Lots of business logic revolves around making sure you have one and only one thing. How about this?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    let singletonTestData1=[1]
    let singletonTestData2=[]
    // reuturns the value or throws an error
    let singletonRet1=List.exactlyOne singletonTestData1
    // returns the value or none
    let singletonRet2:Option&lt;int&gt;=
        Option.protect List.exactlyOne singletonTestData2
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's pretty nifty because you can make sure it's only one item (or throw an error), catch the error and deal with it later (not shown here), or bail out on any decision-making entirely and let somebody else worry about it, ie, use an option.</p><p>I imagine we could do the same with atLeastOne. In fact, I might code that up as a PR. That's also a very common business requirement.</p><p>And you can extend generics too. How many times have you written a function and wanted to use it later as an operator? That kinda thing is fairly common in C++, and you can certainly do it in NET, but many times to get it done it seems unnecessarily complicated. How about this?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
    // turn any function into an operator
    let smallerThan a b=a &lt; b
    // isSmaller = true
    let isSmaller = 10 &lt;/smallerThan/&gt; 20
    ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I'm not crazy about that syntax, but fooling around with it some, I can see where the FSharpPlus guys were coming from. There are some odd language issues at stake, and this looks like a good compromise. I think this works better than some of the other options.</p><p>Once again, none of this is rocket science. All along you could have made this happen in whatever .NET language you use. It's nice having it already in there. Thanks guys!</p><p>I saw this one and almost had a nerdgasm. Every now and then you'll have a string and want to convert it to bytes, perhaps for some low-level fun with bits. Ever try to do that from scratch? Wow, it's a pain. There are excellent reasons it's a pain: there's encoding, there's collation rules, the list goes on and on. Human languages are tough. But what about just a dang default? Try this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Generic operators
    // Whatever I've got, make it bytes
    let myBufferBytes =
        "This is something I need to do bit-level stuff with" |&gt; toBytes
        ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Because that's a type extension on a generic, that works with all types of stuff. Just throw whatever you've got to toBytes and move on.</p><p>You can do this on your own, but you'll kill precious development time (and focus) wading through docs. And if you only do it one or two times a year it'll be that same pain, over and over again.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Need to splay out a bunch of processing and then sum when done?
    let res42 = map ((+) 21) (async {return 21})
    let myComputationallyHardAnswer = extract res42
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Here we've wrapped up some common threading stuff along with collection traversal.</p><p>Of course, it's all composable with all of the other tools you have.</p><p>In another post I'll do some of the other cool stuff, like all of the mondad things they have, &nbsp;but that really gets into the technical part of coding itself instead of the convenience provided here. For now, <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus">you should check it out</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>    </div>

<p>Revolut customers in Europe received this email around 4.54PM CET.</p>
<h2>Trading Update for GME &amp; AMC</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Hi …,</p>
<p>From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: <strong>GME</strong>) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: <strong>AMC</strong>) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>
<p>You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.</p>
<p>None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.</p>
<p>For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don’t want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Why is this happening?</h3>
<p>When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.</p>
<p>The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.</p>
<p>This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>When will they be available again to buy?</h3>
<p>This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>Team Revolut</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Capital at Risk</strong></p>
<p>The value of a stock may fall as well as rise and you may get back less than what you initially paid, and in some cases the stock may lose its entire value and you may lose your initial investment. This is not investment advice. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making any investment decision.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Revolut is one of the most popular investing apps in Europe. Maybe it is not that well-known in US yet.</p>
<p>But, until recently, it was one of possible alternatives to Robinhood to buy $GME and $AMC stocks.<br>

What are alternatives to Revolut in Europe – to buy $GME and $AMC stocks?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/02/02/revolut-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invezz</a>, you can still buy these stocks in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saxo</li>
<li>BlackBull markets</li>
<li>AvaTrade</li>

Typically your computer makes a request for some information and the server responds:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your computer:</strong> Yo, what's good about this random site learnreact.design?</p><p><strong>The server:</strong> Hang on, let me grab something for you. Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure. How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?</p><p>Using this information, the browser creates something called... the DOM!</p><div><p><img alt="Introducing the DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Wait a second, the DOM is a ... tree? Yup, a tree! Oddly enough, a lot of things in our computer look like a tree. Let's give our tree friend a nickname... hmm what about Domo?</p><p>Domo works as a model at the prestigious art studio "Web Browser". His job is to pose in front of the artist who paints a portrait (or perhaps millions of portraits).</p><div><p><img alt="Domo at the art studio Web Browser" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In real life, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's indeed a model -- a model of the document (aka the web page). It strikes a pose. The browser paints a portrait. The portraits are what we see on a web page: the textboxes, the paragraphs, the images and so on. A developer's job is like that of a director who tells Domo what to wear and what pose to strike. This determines what those portraits look like in the end.</p><p>To check out what the DOM looks like, if you are using a desktop browser, right-click on this very page and choose "Inspect".

The artist isn't able to paint new portraits until Domo changes to a new pose.</p><p>How would we get Domo to change to a new pose?</p><p>We just talk to him. He listens.

A developer would sprinkle some interactivity on top of the static pages by writing small amount of JavaScript code.</p><p>However, with the emergence of SPAs (Single Page Application) such as Gmail and Google Maps, people started to expect a lot more. Instead of mostly static web <em>pages</em>, they want web <em>apps</em> that are interactive, fast and responsive.</p><p>The code required to build web apps becomes increasingly large and complex. It often requires the collaboration of many team members.</p><p>The traditional approach stopped working.

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been trying to read more applied crypto papers here and there, and this
past week, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1491.pdf">Partitioning Oracle Attacks</a>
(Len, Grubbs, Ristenpart) came up on my reading list. This paper presents a new
class of attack against certain cryptographic protocols that are based on
low-entropy secrets (e.g., passwords). It’s a way to dramatically speed up
guessing attacks – for example, in some cases the attack allows the attacker to
binary-search over a dictionary of passwords instead of trying them one-by-one.
This type of attack seems likely to become a classic because it applies to some
well-known encryption schemes and many different applications.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll give a high-level overview of another classic oracle attack
(padding oracles), and compare and contrast to the new concept of partitioning
oracle attacks as I understand them; my goal here is to make these attacks
accessible to people with minimal cryptography background. Then I’ll give one of
my hot takes about PAKEs, which is probably mostly of interest to people who
have read the partitioning oracles paper or similar.</p>

<h2 id="oracles-by-example">Oracles by example</h2>

<p>In cryptography, “oracle” means a black-box function or system that takes an
input and returns an output. In the context of an attack, an oracle is used to
formally model unexpected information leakage that gives the attacker some extra
information. Oracle attacks are interesting and educational because they
illustrate why it’s so important that an encryption of a message reveals <em>no
(efficiently computable) information</em> about the message itself: even seemingly
innocuous extraneous information can be used, surprisingly, to break the
encryption scheme entirely.</p>

<p>Typically, when cryptographers describe an attacker for a cryptosystem, they
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack">model</a> the attacker as
having certain capabilities, such as the capability to request encryptions for a
reasonable number of messages of their choice. Then the attacker has a challenge
that they have to solve, such as distinguishing an encryption of another message
of their choice from an encryption of a random message.</p>

<p>But in a real implementation of that cryptosystem, the attacker might learn a
lot more than is modeled in these formal enumerations of their capabilities. The
attacker might be able to observe the time that it takes to encrypt a message,
or might even learn something about the contents of a message from elsewhere in
the system. Oracles are a way to formally describe this type of leakage. For
example, suppose a server decrypts a message and then inserts it into a
database, and the database returns an error in a short-circuit if the message’s
first byte is <code>0x00</code>, and goes on to do some other processing otherwise. An
attacker can learn from observing the timing of this database operation whether
the message starts with <code>0x00</code>. We can model this as an oracle, by saying that
the attacker has the capability to query an oracle function whose output is 1 if
and only the message starts with <code>0x00</code>.</p>

<p>The classic example of an oracle attack is a padding oracle, where the attacker
learns a single extra bit about any arbitrary ciphertext: whether it is padded
correctly. “Padding” here refers to the fact that many encryption schemes don’t
work on messages of arbitrary lengths. For example, it’s common for encryption
algorithms to process messages in blocks of 16 bytes, so messages have to be
padded to a multiple of 16 bytes, with some well-defined and reversible padding
scheme. One example of a padding scheme is to fill in the padding bytes with the
length of the padding. In this scheme, a message of length 60 bytes will be
padded with 4 bytes set to the value <code>0x04</code>, so that the ciphertext is an even
16 x 4 = 64 bytes long.</p>

<p>When implementing cryptographic algorithms, it’s easy to accidentally provide a
padding oracle to attackers. The oracle often comes from a timing side-channel,
because it’s tempting to short-circuit if padding is invalid and not go on to do
other processing that is done for correctly padded messages.</p>

<p>And it’s not too hard to implement a padding oracle attack for many encryption
schemes. I’ll illustrate this with a hypothetical example that demonstrates the
basic concept.</p>

<p>Suppose you have an encryption scheme where flipping a bit in a ciphertext flips
the corresponding bit in the underlying plaintext. So if you encrypt some
message <em>m</em>, flip the last bit in the ciphertext, and then decrypt it, you’ll
get a message which is the same as <em>m</em> but with the last bit flipped. (It might
seem, intuitively, that a secure encryption scheme shouldn’t have this property
that you can transform a ciphertext to produce a predictable transformation in
the plaintext, but this property on its own isn’t actually enough to break the
encryption algorithm. The property is called <em>malleability</em>, and some common
encryption algorithms have it and others don’t.)</p>

<p>Suppose you’re using this encryption scheme with the padding scheme I described
above: messages are padded with <em>n</em> bytes, each set to the value <em>n</em>, to extend
the message length to a multiple of 16 bytes. We’ll say that there’s always at
least one byte of padding added, so a message that is originally 16 bytes would
be padded to 32 bytes.</p>

<p>Now consider an attacker who has some ciphertext which is an encryption of a
message <em>m</em>, and the attacker wants to learn what <em>m</em> is. The attacker can
request decryptions for an arbitrary number of ciphertexts to learn if the
underlying plaintexts have valid padding – this is the padding oracle. Here’s
the attacker’s algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, we need to figure out what the padding value is. The attacker will do
this by searching for how to transform the original message into a message
that has only one byte of padding. The attacker iteratively chooses a byte <em>b</em>
from <code>0x01</code> to <code>0xff</code>, and at each iteration, the attacker xors the last byte
of the ciphertext with <em>b</em> and queries to see if the padding is valid.
(Technically we don’t have to check every possible value of <em>b</em>, because we
know there are only so many possible values of the real underlying padding
byte, but that’s an optimization we can ignore for simplicity.)
    <ul>
      <li>When the attacker finds a value for b that produces valid padding, then
the attacker has learned that the last byte of the message xored with <em>b</em>
is (probably<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>) equal to <code>0x01</code>, which allows them to recover the actual
last byte of the message – the length of the original message’s padding.</li>
      <li>If every possible value of <em>b</em> results in a padding error, then the
attacker knows that the actual padding value is <code>0x01</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Suppose the attacker has now discovered that there are 3 bytes of padding in
the original message, so the last 3 bytes of the message are <code>0x03</code>. The
attacker is now going to search for the value of the 4th-to-last byte of the
message (which is the last byte of the original unpadded message). They’ll do
this by transforming the last 3 bytes of the message from <code>0x03</code> to <code>0x04</code>, and
then searching for how to transform the 4th-to-last byte to <code>0x04</code>:
    <ul>
      <li>To transform the last 3 bytes of the underlying message from <code>0x03</code> to
<code>0x04</code>, the attacker xors the last 3 bytes of the ciphertext with <code>0x07</code>
(because <code>0x03 ⊕ 0x07 = 0x04</code>).</li>
      <li>If at this point the ciphertext produces valid padding, then the attacker
knows that the 4th-to-last byte is <code>0x04</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, now the attacker again iterates from <em>b</em> = <code>0x01</code> to <code>0xff</code> and
xors the 4th-to-last byte of the ciphertext with <em>b</em>. When the attacker
finds a value of <em>b</em> that produces valid padding, they know that the
4th-to-last byte’s value xored with <em>b</em> is (again, probably) <code>0x04</code>, and
from that they can recover that byte’s value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now it’s a simple matter of iterating this procedure for each remaining byte,
from last to first, to recover the entire message!</li>
</ul>

<p>The high-level idea is that if an attacker can transform a ciphertext in a way
that produces a predictable change in the plaintext, they can use this to search
for transformations that produce valid padding. If they know that a transformed
byte of ciphertext produces a valid padding byte in the plaintext, then they
might be able to learn what the original byte of plaintext was by undoing that
transformation.</p>

<h2 id="partitioning-oracles">Partitioning oracles</h2>

<p>Now that I’ve talked so much about padding oracles, you might be a bit peeved to
hear that partitioning oracles are not really like padding oracles at all. I
believe that they both will be classic oracle attacks with significant practical
impact, but that’s mostly where the similarity ends. I mostly explained padding
oracles because they are a relatively straightforward example of what an oracle
is and how it can be used, and because they can help explain partitioning
oracles as a series of contrasts.</p>

<h3 id="attack-target-plaintext-versus-password">Attack target: plaintext versus password</h3>

<p>Whereas a padding oracle attack aims to recover a plaintext from a ciphertext, a
partitioning oracle attack aims to recover the secret key – which is far more
devastating, because it allows the attacker to subsequently decrypt any message.
Padding oracles are relevant to any cryptosystem that uses a padding scheme, but
partitioning oracle attacks specifically target cryptosystems that derive keys
from low-entropy secrets like passwords.</p>

<p>Password-based cryptosystems are inherently weaker than systems where a key is
chosen at random. The space of passwords is usually smaller than the space of
possible keys, and passwords can be chosen weakly, often coming from a large
dictionary of common passwords. Password-based cryptosystems aim to at least
avoid offline brute-force attackers, where an attacker can eavesdrop on some
communication and then try a bunch of different passwords offline. Instead, the
attacker should be forced to interact with the legitimate parties; in the real
world, this is a significant deterrent since the attacker will be subject to
denial-of-service and anti-fraud protections if they have to interact with a
real server, plus the time required to process each guess will be slowed down by
network latency and other factors.</p>

<p>So, the partitioning oracle setting is …</p></div></div>

I’m your host, Dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Felienne Hermans about how we can learn to program faster, better, and more easily. But before I start, I want to tell you a bit more about ConfigCat – today’s sponsor of this episode. ConfigCat is a feature flag management tool that allows you to seamless and effortless switch features on and off in your application through an intuitive user interface. Everyone on the team, independent of the tech skills, is ready to go within 10 minutes of training to configure the feature set that your user sees based on rules. You can even start to do sophisticated A/B testing, hassle-free and intuitively within a few minutes.</p><p>Super interesting for my listeners doing business within Europe, ConfigCat allows you to have your data distributed in the European Union only so you can easily stay GDPR compliant. So if you want to tap into the sheer possibilities of feature flag management, go have a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://configcat.com/" rel="nofollow">https://configcat.com/</a></p><p>I tried it and I promise you’re up and running within few minutes. Feature flags mean faster deploys with less risks. Less risks is also the generous free plan of ConfigCat. You can start for free today. And with each paid plan, they plant a tree. Cool. Right?</p><p>But now back to Felienne. Felienne is an associate professor at the university of Leiden and investigate how we can best learn how to program Felina is also active in the developer community and organize several developer, meetups, and conferences. She’s a big fan of legal and served for many years as a legal judge at local competitions for kids, her passionate for bringing young kids into TAFE also leads her to being a teacher at the high school in the Netherlands. Currently feeling also writes a book called programmer’s brain explaining what happens in our brain when we learn to code, but also when we read and drive and try to understand code. So I’m super thrilled to have Nina here with me, the unit, what? Come to</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:01:57] Michelle. Thanks for having me.</p><p><span>Michaela:</span>&nbsp;[00:01:59] Yeah, I’m really, really happy. It took quite some time, but now you’re here. And I’m so I’m so curious to learn more about the program is brain, because this is an area that I’m super interested. I mean, we both have been doing the PhD together right. In the same research group, but we were sitting in the same office and I was researching program comprehension. So how are people understanding code. And so this is so close to what really interests me, what really fascinates me. So I’m super thrilled to learn more about that. So can you tell me a little bit about the book, but also your research? Because I think the book is very close to your research that you are doing at university of Leiden,</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:02:38] right? Yeah. That’s correct. And maybe we have to go once. So Beko about what lead me to write this book and what lead me to, to do this research because initially what exactly we were doing your PhD at the same time. And then I wasn’t so interested in program comprehension. I was more interested in developer tools at that time, but then what happened is I started to teach. And then when I started to teach, I realized that. Programming is so hard. I think I sort of forgot because I was already programming for such a long time for myself, that all these parts of programming, like there is so much you have to get, right. If you’re making a program, you have to make a plan in your head. Like this is where I’m going, which requires you to understand the domain, the problem that you’re solving. But at the same time, you also have to be like ridiculously precise. You have to get. Periods and semi-colons and brackets and everything has to fit at so many different levels that when I started to teach kids, it’s like, Oh my God, this is so hard. Why is this so hard? Why is it so hard, for example, for children to remember syntax? Why is it so hard for kids to remember what I was working on there? Sometimes I saw kids was very engaged in a problem, and then I explained something to them. And then a few days later it was like, Oh, I have no recollection of this. And I was like, but I explained this to you, like just a few days ago, how do you not remember? Or I saw them very determined of, Oh, I’m making a game and a cat has to catch fish or something. This is what I’m doing. And then they sorta got sidetracked. And then you, you walk past five minutes later and it was like, Why aren’t you making a game with a cat and it goes like, Oh yeah, that’s true. I totally forgot. He goes, I fell into some hole of a variable or a loop. So that just got me really, really excited to understand more about how do people think, how do people remember things? And of course there was so much research already that wasn’t so connected to programming. This is relatively easy to read all sorts of introduction, books into cognition and cognitive science. But then I realized there wasn’t really a book that explains. Beginner, cognitive science in the context of programming. So then I was like, I could write that book because now I know a lot.</p><p><span>Michaela:</span>&nbsp;[00:04:51] Oh, yeah, very good. And so I actually watched one of your talks. I forgot where it was, but it was really good to talk about programming and understanding program. And you were also talking about kids and when I watched that, and also when I heard you talk right now, I’m wondering, but can we actually generalized from kids to adults? Right. So do we struggled the same way as kids. I struggle. And I definitely do see like this abstraction levels. Right. You have to be very detailed as you said, with the center rugs and semi-colons, or even like tabs and so on. And then you have like this, this larger vision that you have to keep in mind, but do we struggle in the same way or do adults have different problems also compared to</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:05:31] kids? That’s a great question. So in general, adults and kids do learn and struggle at the same level, but that is the case for Morphis adults. So if, if a 10 year old is learning to program and let’s say your next door neighbor is also learning to program, and they’re not a programmer, right. Then they will very much struggle with the same thing. However, if you, if your question is about expert programmers, then they don’t, then they also struggle, but they struggle in different ways. So you already know Java and now you want to learn R then your circle will be different than someone that doesn’t know Java that is learning. Whether that’s a kid or an adult. Okay. Yeah,</p><p><span>Michaela:</span>&nbsp;[00:06:09] I see. And so something else that, that I also thought when, when I heard you talk about all different concepts and you were saying, well, next word known something different than like a novice or, or struggles differently. Like for example, I’m trying to learn new programming languages. Right. And so I, I know Java, I know C-sharp, I know Hiten and a little bit of JavaScript, but. You know, the further it goes away from the languages that I initially learned with her Java and object oriented programming, the more I’m struggling. Right. So I’m struggling, I think, because I have all these preconceived ideas, mental models notions off, you know, what’s right. And what’s wrong, how to do that. And then sometimes I feel like. Oh, this doesn’t work so well now in PI 10, right there, maybe this is not that I’m not meant to do it that way. Right. And so how can, how can people that already know language? How can they overcome those things are some techniques that we can employ, right. To get better at learning new languages. Yeah,</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:07:08] definitely. So one of the things that I talk about in my book is the concept of transfer. So transfer is you already know something about domain a and that helps you to learn domain B. So if you have two languages that are very close together, let’s say she’s sharp in Java. Then you probably experienced lots of positive trends. Like, Oh, I already know this. Oh, it’s exactly the same in Jaffa. That’s no issue. So that’s positive transfer, but then you also have. Negative transfer where you assume that something works a certain way and then it doesn’t. And for example, if you do, Oh, object oriented programming in Java, and then you go to Python, then there’s also object oriented programming. There’s also classes and methods. So maybe you’re like. I know this stuff. I understand what a method is. And then suddenly stuff, of course in Python happens as real time. And then you’re like, Whoa, everything I knew was wrong. So there you have negative transfer where you might assume that you know something and especially if you’re an expert and also you think this cannot be hard. I am already an expert programmer, so probably Python. Isn’t very hard. And then it’s harder than you think. And then of course you also run into issues of motivation where you’re like. I will never learn this because it’s so hard. So actually, if you want to improve on transfer, there are two techniques that people typically use and the techniques are called hugging and bridging. So hugging is where you try to get the concepts to be really close together. An example of hugging is if you already know Java. Then it might be easier for you to solve a problem in Java. So first you solve the problem in Java and then you simply, it’s not always simple, but simply translate your solution into, let’s say Python, if you’re learning that. So that makes it easier than the are. You’re trying to get the languages closer together. And with bridging you’re deliberately looking for concepts that are the same. So you, …</p></div></div></div></div>

				SSD`s are the life blood of our fmadio 10G, 40G, 100G ethernet capture systems. They provide backing storage that well exceeds that of conventional RAM, are super fast and light weight. Thus its prudent to keep the SSD farms in top nick, optimal health, and occasionally perform emergency room brain surgery on them. Unfortunately today is one of those days.
			</p>
			<br>

			</div>


		<p>
As with all things, it happened late on a Friday night when I was adding a new feature to the system that wipes all capture data from the system. This is simple button click on the web UI page as our clients data is quite sensitive thus needs to be deleted when the box moves internally or externally. The wipe is implemented using the "Secure Erase" ATA-8 command, you can read all about it <a href="https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase">here</a>. Its essentially a restore-to-factory-setting operation. Meaning after the SecureErase the drive`s internal state is the same as "just left the factory". 
		</p>
		
		<p>
Which is great when it works, but this kind of low level drive formatting is pretty complicated with many (presumably) asynchronous operations going on in parallel... and doing 100 of these operations back to back at high speed is probably something the vendor did not expect (I was testing dammit!). In our case this bricked 6 SSD`s rendering them completely useless causing myself quite the stress as I now have several thousand dollars worth of inventory destroyed!  - not a good day.

</p><p>
The usual suspects to recover were tried and failed, leaving only a few options.
<br>
</p>

<h5>a) RMA the boards back to the seller<br>
b) Contact vendor support<br>
c) Perform surgery</h5>


<p>
Option a) of RMA`ing the boards was the safest option, tho usually you get some other previously recycled RMA`ed device back. Option b) of contacting the vendor is always such a brutally painful experience. It would likely end up with some random "Customer Support" person with a strange accent... giving the default completely useless response of RMA the device and get a replacement kind of thing... ho hum. Which leaves surgery! Now I usually don't go messing with hardware like this (anymore... :) ) because it takes up quite a bit time. However SSD health and prosperity is directly linked to our profitability thus deemed it a worth while time investment to have a more intimate relationship with our SSD models of choice. 
</p>
<br>

<div><p>
The process starts with a general reconnaissance mission of what pins are accessible, and what those pins are for. First up was finding the UART / serial interface but it was silent and likely disabled by the firmware. Next up was what most likely looked like a JTAG interface and... bingo, full JTAG interface connecting and operating as expected.
</p><p>

 JTAG is a hardware based system debugger that for CPU`s let you control instruction execution and read/write memory anywhere. You can see in the picture below some soldering of header pins was required, that is then wired to a breadboard which is wired to a Raspberry PI.
</p></div>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd with jtag connected"></p><div><p>
Raspberry PI? wtf ? In this case the Raspberry PI was converted into a JTAG debugger using the outstanding software over at <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>. As "real" JTAG debuggers are quite expensive ranging from $100 - $1000+ making OCD coupled with the PI an excellent low cost alternative. 
</p><p>

At this point you get a small rush as you gain access and poke the device, after which the vastness of having no idea what anything does starts to weigh you down. Then slowly bit by bit, instruction after instruction, string after string you gain some intuition on the memory map, what the code does, how its setup and eventually find something interesting.
</p></div> 

<p>

The first entry point to look for is the classic printf / trace / debug operation which gives you insight into what the software is doing. And eventually managed to track down the code that`s basically

<code>
void trace(char* Message, ...)
{ 
	va_arg list;
	va_start(arglist, Message);

	char buf[1024];
	vsprintf(buf, Message, arglist);

	if (debug_enable)
	{
		fwrite(output, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
</code>

which writes out a string to a console to tell the developer on whats going on. Note that the code has to "flatten" the string first before even deciding to output or not, which gives us a nice window to sniff the string with JTAG even if nothing is written to the console. 
</p>


<p>
After sniffing strings for a while and getting a better feel for whats happening noticed that the SSD is receiving commands from the SATA host no problem. But there`s some sort of funkyness going on that causes the SSD to send no response back - kind of a one-way-street. One idea to resolve this is: in theory the security erase operation restores everything back to good health. The question tho, is the device actually processing a security erase request ?  
</p>


<p>
... and using our printf JTAG sniffer... it most certainly is processing the request! But failing miserably due to an incorrect password. You can see the sniffed printf jtag string in the output below. Hint: <i>"&lt;SED&gt; Credential Comparison Failed"</i> ASCIIZ string.
</p>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_fail.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase fail"></p><p>
Which makes it clear why the security erase / factory reset failed but more importantly you can track down the offending bit of code from this string. That results in the following snippet of assembler courtesy of the IDA toolset below.
</p> 

<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_check.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password check"></p><p>
To decode that for you its doing a 32 byte long compare against some expected cryptographic hash key. Then the <i>"magic compare"</i> aka instruction <b>CMP R5, #1</b> is testing if the keys matched. Then doing a conditional jump to a printf routine based on that comparison result <b>BLNE sub_80...</b>. And finally  the functions return value is the result of the comparison <b>MOV R0, R5</b>. Nothing particularly fancy going on.
</p> 


<p>
There`s a few ways to go from here. One would be to reverse engineer how the 32B key is generated and create  a general purpose exploit. The other would be to just patch the binary such that it thinks it passed the security check. eg Fake a correct password response. We chose the latter as it only takes a few minutes and all I want is to restore the SSD farm`s health. Patching the binary with JTAG is trivial, console output is shown below.
</p> 


<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_patch.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password fake"></p><div><p>
The above shows disassembling the patched code first, the "before" section. This is to check we overwrite the correct bit of code. Then patch it using the command <b>cpu0 arm mww</b> with the value 0xe3a05001. Then disassemble again "after section" to confirm the patch worked and has the correct instruction. 
</p><p>

In this case we replaced <b>BLNE</b> instruction (print error message to the console) with <b>MOV r5, #1</b> at address 0x8009abe4 (shown in blue). The result of the "magic check" is 0 for fail, 1 for pass and write it to register r5. All we did is ignore the whole comparison and simply override it and say the security check always passes (r5 = 1).
</p></div> 

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Now its patched, with cpu`s resumed its the moment of truth. Issuing the security erase operation from the host system via hdparm. 
<br>
<code>
$ sudo hdparm --security-erase 1234  /dev/sdb
security_password="1234"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="1234, user=user
$
</code>
<br>
... and it worked! the SSD is back to life, working as normal and running at high speed!  ... with <b>several thousand dollars worth of SSD`s back in business</b> making our 10G, 40G, 100G network capture systems more resilient than ever. Now if the SSD vendor (who shall remain nameless) would fix the dam bug so excessive back-to-back security password/erase does NOT brick the device, life would be so much better. 
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I wanted to write a program that I could feed a bunch of novels and then produce similar text to the author’s writing.</p>
<p>One method of generating fake but familiar looking text is to use a Markov chain generator. There is a fantastic Python library for doing this called <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">jsvine/markovify</a> but I wanted to learn more about how it works under the hood so I implemented the algorithms from scratch!</p>
<p>Before we get to text generation, let’s start by generating some fake weather. Skip the following section if you’re familiar with Markov chains.</p>
<h2 id="fake-weather-generation"><a href="#fake-weather-generation" aria-label="fake weather generation permalink"></a>Fake Weather Generation</h2>
<p>I have some historical weather data from my town. The weather here is either sunny or rainy. When it’s sunny, there’s a good chance that it remains sunny the next day. It rarely rains but when it does it often rains for a few days.</p>
<p>Rather than using a naive probability (e.g. there’s an ~83% chance it is sunny vs. rainy on any given day) we’ll use a Markov chain to generate more realistic looking data. Our generated data will have streaks of weather which will more closely resemble real life patterns.</p>
<p>To be specific, if it’s sunny there’s a 10% chance it will be rainy the next day and a 90% chance it will stay sunny. If it’s rainy then there’s 50% chance it will be sunny the next day and a 50% chance it will stay rainy.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram of this two-state Markov process.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/e4ae284c37dcdeb9323b73b3637b6709/b6699/weather-markov-chain.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Instead of using weights to describe probability, let’s distribute the states in a list that we randomly pick from. I find that defining Markov chains like this (while far more computationally expensive) is easier to debug.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>weather_chain <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'sun'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'rain'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We consume this model by picking a random starting state and using the current state to choose randomly from the possible future states. We do this over and over to generate a sequence.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> random


weather <span>=</span> <span>[</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span>weather_chain<span>.</span>keys<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>

<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    weather<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span>weather_chain<span>[</span>weather<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example output, we can see that rainy days are ‘sticky’ as we would expect from the model. </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="fake-text-generation"><a href="#fake-text-generation" aria-label="fake text generation permalink"></a>Fake Text Generation</h2>
<p>Instead of having a predefined Markov chain like we saw in the previous section, let’s build one from real data. The full source code for this article and the text corpuses can be found at <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/markov-chain-generator">healeycodes/markov-chain-generator</a>.</p>
<p>The code excerpts assume that we’re generating fiction. So the source text must have capital letters at the start of sentences and full stops at the end of sentences. We can use these two markers to generate text chunks that have a beginning and an end.</p>
<p>In our weather example, the state size was one — to decide the next step in the sequence, we only considered one previous day of weather. When it comes to generating language, a state size of one sometimes isn’t big enough and the arrangement of words can be too random to be interesting. A state size of two is a good starting point. Going higher than two can produce text that is too similar to the original text corpus.</p>
<p>The following function builds a Markov chain in the same format as our weather example. It takes a source text and a state size and returns a dictionary where the keys are the current state and their values are a list of possible future states. The lists contain duplicates and this is how we handle the probabilities of future states.</p>

<p>Given a tiny source of <code>'An apple is very good. An orange is very bad.'</code> and a state size of <code>2</code> it will produce the following Markov chain. Since the source was so small there are only four possible complete sentences.</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"An apple"</span><span>:</span><span>[</span>
    <span>"is"</span>

<p>The following function consumes the Markov chain model and generates some fake text for us. To achieve a minimum length, we keep generating until we hit the minimum length and then keep going until we reach a token that ends with a full stop. To find a correct starting point, we pick a random key (two words) where the first character is a capital letter.</p>

<p>Here are those four possible complete sentences from our previous Markov chain. These can be combined infinitely by our function.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>'An apple is very bad.'
'An orange is very bad.'
'An orange is very good.'
'An apple is very good.'</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="some-examples"><a href="#some-examples" aria-label="some examples permalink"></a>Some Examples</h2>
<p>We can now feed in large amounts of text from an author and generate fake writing! In fact, any corpus that uses sentences will work with our program. For example, here is the result of feeding in a few Wikipedia articles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cricket is more similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the latest hour of it; and lately, I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all the more remote islands. At around the field. One of Wollstonecraft’s most popular metaphors draw on military concepts: Disease is an early type of fiction that were quick to resort to violence. One of Wollstonecraft’s favorite arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s some Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count could recollect, it was never worth the trouble of the stranger. But, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of conference with the whole matter as a natural result of the river, and, plunging through a single slender gold chain, and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all. I cannot enter into details just now: but it was found, on Sunday morning, that he was forced to allow, had ever suspected of existing in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever thought of this life and of cutting him off with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and painted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="further-resources"><a href="#further-resources" aria-label="further resources permalink"></a>Further Resources</h2>
<p>The sun/rain example was taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_Markov_chains#A_simple_weather_model">Wikipedia</a>. Victor Powell’s article, <a href="https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/">Markov Chains</a>, was also helpful for my initial understanding and is worth checking out for the interactive graphics alone.</p>
<p>Some of the articles about Markov chains are a little inaccessible to those without a maths background. However, there’s a Simple English version of Wikipedia. Many articles have an alternative page which you can find by replacing the <code>en</code> in the URL bar with <code>simple</code>. For example, the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">simple version</a> of the Markov chain page.</p>
<p>Daniel Shiffman also covered Markov chains in a Coding Challenge on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGFJ8vugIWA">The Coding Train</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>A friend received an offer from a seed-stage startup this week. Already at another seed-stage startup, she asked my thoughts on the offer itself and on the switch between companies. I walked through the factors I consider in my own decisions, but as I talked, I felt less sure of my own process. Nothing in the startup world is certain; </span><a href="https://medium.com/@justincie/startup-success-isnt-about-genius-it-s-about-manipulating-the-odds-873d93d02029" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>we are all just betting on outcomes</span></a><span>. We can optimize for certain factors, but in the end, we must decide how to play our hand. Plenty has been written about joining a startup, but how do we decide when to leave one?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A startup is </span><a href="https://medium.com/start-up-vision/a-startup-is-either-growing-or-dying-564af328a6c4" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>either growing or dying</span></a><span>, and a well-positioned one should have a strong market, assets, and team. Even with all three, the journey will still be difficult. If the bus is going to run out of gas before reaching the destination, does it matter </span><a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>if I’m in the right seat</span></a><span>? First think through business viability to figure out if you even want to be on the bus. Here are questions I use to get started.</span></p>

<p><b>Market</b></p>
<p><span>If the market is established:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Who are the competitors in the space?</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What do the recent IPOs/acquisitions look like?</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What is the company’s competitive edge?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If the market is new:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Why is now the right time to start the market?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Why will the company succeed in places other companies haven’t gone?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Assets</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>How far along is the product?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Who are the customers and how are the relationships?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What’s the funding situation?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Who are the investors?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Team</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Does the team have the right experience to execute what needs to happen?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Are there growth plans to mitigate the obstacles that lie ahead?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Do people know their own strengths and weaknesses?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Are difficult and honest conversations being had about the company’s direction?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Feeling good about all three? Plenty can still go wrong, but your company might have a chance. If two of the three are in a good place, is there a route to quickly strengthen the third? What would it take to make that happen and how likely is the company to execute on it? It’s impossible to predict all of the factors crucial to success, but it doesn’t hurt to ask the questions.</span></p>

<p><span>Maybe the startup is doing incredibly well, but you’re feeling less sure about your seat on the bus. Is that a sign you need to leave or just </span><a href="https://medium.com/@ubiquityvc/startup-vs-big-tech-why-the-grass-isnt-always-greener-e8cebb6d5191" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>“grass is greener”</span></a><span> syndrome?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Try running a </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-negative-thinking-can-help-you-successfully-make-decisions-2020-10" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>pre-mortem</span></a><span> on your career trajectory. Write out how you might fail and what the fallout could be. Will you lose relationships because of the long hours you put into the startup? Will the stress of the long hours cause you to pack on pounds? Will you end up wishing that you had stayed at your startup until it went public?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Looking at the worst case scenario can show us that what we most fear either won’t be that bad or that we can proactively avoid it. Identify the paths you’ll regret most and </span><a href="https://alyjuma.medium.com/the-regret-minimization-framework-how-jeff-bezos-made-decisions-4d5a86deaf24" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>work to avoid them</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>But what about the best case scenario in which your hard-earned equity turns into millions? </span><a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/stock-options-are-for-suckers-who-accept-below-market-rate-pay/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>It’s highly unlikely</span></a><span> but not impossible. Are you optimizing the factors that matter most to you where you are?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Salary</b></p>
<p><span>Early-stage startups aren’t known for particularly high salaries, but if you’re with the company as it goes through additional rounds of funding, this can change. Significant contributors have more leeway on compensation than they might know, especially if additional funding has come through.</span></p>

<p><b>Title</b></p>
<p><span>Yes, titles are subjective because they differ widely between companies, but they can also give weight to your credentials. Are there still opportunities to move up the ladder where you are, even if that will mean creating a new title? Would you be able to get the same title outside of your company?</span></p>

<p><b>Equity</b></p>
<p><span>Do you have enough stake in the company to feel that your contributions could eventually pay off? Again, it’s unlikely, but we have to </span><a href="https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/take-asymmetric-bets" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>take asymmetric bets</span></a><span> to win big.</span></p>

<p><b>Knowledge</b></p>
<p><span>Learning doesn’t pay the bills, but incredible experience from one role can shape the rest of your career.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Are you getting more responsibility than you might at another company?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Are you in the room when big decisions are being made?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you working alongside industry experts that you may not have the chance to be near again?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you establishing relationships (customers, investors, coworkers) that will propel you forward later on?</span></li>
<li><span>Is your impact more significant where you are than at a larger, more established organization?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If all else fails, determine where you ultimately want to go and </span><a href="https://medium.com/@m2jr/how-to-build-a-breakthrough-3071b6415b06" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>backtrack from there</span></a><span>. If you’re unsure of the destination, it doesn’t really matter which bus you get on.</span></p>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work in architecture roles alongside experienced software/technical/solution architects. Through observing others and my own trial and error, I’ve learned a little bit about what <em>not</em> to do in these roles (because it’s often easier to reflect on what didn’t work rather than what did). Even though I lean towards the idea that everyone should be architecting the system rather than having architects solely responsible - I recognise that some organisations are far from that ideal, and it’s those folks I hope find this list helpful. So here it is, 7 behaviours to avoid if you’re in a software architecture role:</p>
<h2 id="1-dont-ignore-the-engineering-team">1. Don’t ignore the engineering team</h2>
<p>If you’re not “hands-on” with the engineering team either through writing or reviewing code or deep in the technical discussions, then the likelihood is you aren’t close enough to the problems and the individuals on the team. If you’re not feeling their pain, then you are probably lacking the empathy and understanding to provide effective guidance. If you find yourself in this position, I would consider beginning with one-on-ones and pairing with engineers as the quickest way to increase empathy and understanding. Then look to participate in feature kick-offs, technical design discussions and code reviews where necessary.</p>
<h2 id="2-dont-ignore-the-domain">2. Don’t ignore the domain</h2>
<p>It’s part of the role to become a domain expert. This knowledge can be used to act as an effective translator between business and engineering. That said, you’ll want to avoid being a communication bottleneck too, so it’s important to teach, translate and document domain context and business value for the engineering team. This is where techniques like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/value-stream-mapping">value-stream mapping</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming">event storming</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ntcoding/status/1342805885224177666">domain-driven design</a> can really help.</p>
<h2 id="3-dont-prescribe-or-mandate-architectures">3. Don’t prescribe or mandate architectures</h2>
<p>For the most part, our industry has moved past the notion that a system’s architecture is designed in isolation (or in an ivory tower) and handed-off to engineers to deliver. However, it definitely still happens. Software architecture and development should be inter-weaving activities, with feedback from one influencing the other. Keeping that feedback loop as short as possible will likely lead to better outcomes. So if you would like to design and create more resilient systems and your organisation tends to mandate or prescribe architectures; consider how you can best empower engineers to make sound architecture decisions instead. Working with the engineers to agree on a foundation of architectural principles and accepting that architecture is never done, it should evolve and change over time are good places to begin (see the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures">Building Evolutionary Architectures</a> book for more on this).</p>
<h2 id="4-dont-just-seek-architectural-consistency">4. Don’t just seek architectural consistency</h2>
<p>Consistency certainly has a place in organisations that build and maintain many systems in order to to help prevent complexity. In my opinion, it’s better to see it as a guideline that will likely have exceptions. Simply seeking or worse, enforcing consistency is a sure-fire way to slow the team down, squash innovation and reduce learning opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="5-dont-forget-about-the-current-architectural-state">5. Don’t forget about the current architectural state</h2>
<p>It can be useful to model a target architecture based on agreed principles and in collaboration with engineers (see #1 and #3 above). However, it must be founded in all the nuance and understanding of the current architecture. Anything else could lead towards a doomed rewrite, an unhappy team or a failed pitch to some confused engineers.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I’ve seen many conversations where stakeholders begin to assume the target state is in fact the current state. This can have significant downsides for the engineering team, for example; a sense of moving too slow, missed tasks that were presumed completed or a lack of appreciation upon completing a large chunk of technical work. Stakeholder discussions about target state may need to include regular reminders about the current state.</p>
<h2 id="6-dont-get-too-attached-to-the-desired-architecture">6. Don’t get too attached to the desired architecture</h2>
<p>It can be easy to fall into the trap of attaching an opinion to your identity, particularly if you’ve got the task of providing a technical direction for an engineering team. New information and unforeseen circumstances will emerge, so any target state will 100% change. As these scenarios surface, you will need to keep an open mind to adapt your view and the direction. A fixed view will only hold back progress. As mentioned in #3, the architecture should be going through constant, incremental change.</p>
<h2 id="7-dont-let-review-processes-stagnate">7. Don’t let review processes stagnate</h2>
<p>As an architect in a large organisation you are likely to be responsible for or actively involved in architectural and security review processes, either as a reviewer or seeking a review. These processes are often change approval reviews that give the green-light for a production release. They can be long and drawn out, unclear in their value, involve reviewers who have zero context, and result in unwanted or unnecessary outcomes; making them the perfect candidates for resisting change. As a more senior figure, an architect should be working hard against that intuition. They should seek to understand the purpose and value of the review process and relay it to others. They should be leading or guiding engineering teams through these processes, particularly for the first time. But most importantly, they should be constantly pushing to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-process-streamlining-change-approval">improve, reduce or potentially remove a review process</a> depending on its purpose and added value.</p>
<p>There you have it! Hopefully I’ll learn even more things to avoid in future but for now, avoid these and you should be good; or at the very least better than a bunch of scenarios I’ve witnessed. For more advice on the topic of software architecture, check out these excellent reads too:</p>

Even though it is something that I use often, I was still confused about what differentiates it from the terminal. Turns out it’s really not that complicated. I learned this by rereading the <em>shell</em> part of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf">the paper</a> from the previous project, and some explanations online like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm">this</a> and <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php">this one</a>. The Unix shell Wikipedia entry was also very informative.</p><p>Since this project is about the shell, I found it appropriate to try and write my own. I settled on the name <em>SeaShell</em>, which I found way too funny. It’s not very advanced, but it does the job.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>3. Ownership and permissions - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess">Tellaccess</a></h2><p>This is one of the things that I know is really important for Linux, but have never really understood. I have tried before but never been able to get the knowledge to stick, maybe because I didn't really care about security until now.</p><p>The ownership and permission system turned out to be really intuitive, and I was able to understand the basics from <a href="https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-basic-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux/">this</a> one article. I later discovered <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/">this one</a> from Linux Handbook which was more comprehensive.</p><p>For the project, I decided to create a program that tells you in human-readable form, the ownership and permissions of a file. I called the project <em>tellaccess</em> because it tells you who can access the file in what ways.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>4. Grep - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/4_Grep__Grep_detective">Grep detective</a></h2><p>Grep is the sort of UNIX magic I have always wanted to learn. Since <em>grep</em> is all about regular expressions I would have to learn that first. This was actually quite difficult because grep uses the <em>POSIX Basic Regular Expressions</em>, which is not that common. The <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions">Wikipedia entry</a> was a lifesaver. Besides that, I also used the man page for <em>grep</em> as a reference.</p><p>For the project, I thought that a fun idea might be to create a detective game. In the game, you get a folder full of files, and it’s your job to extract information. I called the game <em>Grep detective</em>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/4_Grep__Grep_detective/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>5. Awk and sed - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo">Passwdinfo</a></h2><p><em>Awk</em> and <em>sed</em> are more of the UNIX magic that I have always thought was really cool, though I never really understood what they were used for. I often saw answers on Stack Overflow with people using them in crazy one-liners, but I always copy-pasted them without much thought. Well, time to unravel the mystery.</p><p>I primarily used <a href="https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mijp1/teaching/2nd_year_Comp_Lab/guides/grep_awk_sed.pdf">this</a> paper to learn about them. For the project, I wanted to create my own one-liner that shows information about the users on your system in a clear way. I found just reading the <em>/etc/passwd</em> a little too messy, so the project <em>passwdinfo</em>, displays the most important information in a neat table. I found information about the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/">here</a>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>6. Find - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt">Find treasure hunt</a></h2><p>Another important tool I never really got around to learning. Learning how to use <em>find</em> was fairly easy, it was mostly about memorizing the different flags, and the format you set the flags in. I used <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/admm">this</a> as a reference.</p><p>For the project, I created a treasure hunt where you look for clues in files with different attributes. I first wrote a script that created a bunch of small files and directories as noise. Then a selected few of the files got clues to the whereabouts of the other ones. In the end, you find the treasure, which I won’t tell you what is.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>7. File system - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/7_File_system__Root_tour">Root tour</a></h2><p>Ever since I executed my first <em>ls /</em> I have wondered what all those directories were for. Time to unveil the mystery. The first thing I did was read <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/">this</a> article as it explained each directory in root and provided a nice graph. <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html">This</a> resource was also nice since it had a table that summed up each directory in one or two sentences.</p><p>The project ended up being a program that gives you descriptions for directories in your own root folder.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/7_File_system__Root_tour/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>8. Processes - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/8_Processes__Stranger_danger">Stranger danger</a></h2><p>Processes are another important element of Linux that I have never gotten around to learning. Like many other subjects I have covered here, it turned out to be fairly intuitive. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/">This</a> article was really easy to understand.</p><p>I was contemplating for a while what kind of project I could create but ultimately came up with a command that prints all processes that don’t belong to you or root. That way, you can keep a close eye on who is creating processes. Note, there are many legitimate reasons that other users would run processes on your system, and it rarely means someone has gained access to your computer.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/8_Processes__Stranger_danger/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>9. Systemd services - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/9_Systemd_services__Createservice">Createservice</a></h2><p>Whenever I try to set up a database on a Linux machine I have been confused about how to configure the <em>systemd</em> service. I have also been in situations where I needed to create a service from a binary but always struggled. The struggle ends now.
As with any new subject, it’s always a good idea to read the Wikipedia page, so that is where I started. Surprisingly, I learned that <em>systemd</em> is a quite controversial piece of software, but I still wanted to learn it and judge it for myself.
For understanding the basics of <em>systemd</em> I read <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units">this</a> and for understanding how to create a new service I read <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/create-new-service-units-in-systemd/">this</a>.</p><p>For the project, I made <em>createservice</em>, which allows you to make a <em>systemd</em> service from any executable that will automatically start up on boot. Here I test it out on Prometheus:</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/9_Systemd_services__Createservice/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>10. Bash scripting - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/10_Bash_scripting__Penguin_cipher">Penguin cipher</a></h2><p>Bash scripting is something I have been avoiding for a long time. Partly because I believe that my programming language of choice, Go, is almost as handy when it comes to scripting, and partly because I think that Bash syntax looks horrible. Can’t knock it till you try it, so here I am trying to learn Bash scripting.</p><p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/">This</a> was a nice introduction, and after finding <a href="https://devhints.io/bash">this</a> cool cheatsheet I felt comfortable trying to create a project.</p><p>The project ended up being a cipher program I called <em>Penguin cipher</em> after Linux’s mascot. It allows you to encrypt text into something like this: <em>MTExIDIxMSAzMTMgNDAyIDQ2OCA0NjQgMTU5IDI0MSAyMzAgMzY3IDM3NCA1MjYgMTM3IDIyMiAyOTUgMzYzIDQzNCA0MzUg</em></p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/10_Bash_scripting__Penguin_cipher/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><hr><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/carltheperson">Twitter</a></p><div><p>Email me at: <!-- -->  </p><div><p>c</p><p>a</p><p>r</p><p>l</p><p>t</p><p>h</p><p>e</p><p>p</p><p>e</p><p>r</p><p>s</p><p>o</p><p>n</p><p>_</p><p>p</p><p>r</p><p>o</p><p>t</p><p>o</p><p>n</p><p>m</p><p>a</p><p>i</p><p>l</p><p>:</p><p>c</p><p>o</p><p>m</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Advanced phishing attacks are becoming <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank">increasingly commonplace</a>
with tools that allow attackers to harvest credentials, bypass Two-factor authentication (2FA), as well as run automated post-exploit scripts the instant you enter your credentials. This post takes a look at our journey towards releasing <strong>Phinn</strong>, the real-time phishing simulation proxy that sits at the core of the PhishDeck phishing simulation platform.</p><p>In recent years we have seen a dramatic surge and shift in the phishing landscape that we have not seen in a very long time. We now have open-source tools that make it far more accessible than ever before for attackers to set up phishing websites that are virtually indistinguishable from their original counterparts both visually and, more importantly, in their behaviour.</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Recently we chased a skilled red team in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWS</a> that:</p><p>- bypassed MFA<br>- intercepted user sessions w/ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evilginx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Evilginx</a><br>- deployed python-based backdoors on EC2 instances<br>- located key creds on Redshift db<br>- escalated privs via role assumptions</p><p>More details here: <a href="https://t.co/sf25Ovij3w">https://t.co/sf25Ovij3w</a></p></div>— Jon Hencinski (@jhencinski) <a href="https://twitter.com/jhencinski/status/1333808403400024065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote><p>With the adoption of 2FA (albeit somewhat slow) we increase the barrier of entry for attackers. Security vendors have been innovative with their drive towards WebAuthn/U2F solutions, however we see slower adoption in phishing simulation platforms to actively reflect advanced phishing and social engineering attacks to gauge the former’s effectiveness, particularly with WebAuthn being clearer and more precise. Anyone that operates in, or with, a security blue-team (i.e. defense) knows that time-saving and effective solutions are imperative to act as a counterbalance that they can rely on and use.</p><p>The security community has been phenomenal at open-sourcing multiple standalone tools and sharing their knowledge through <a href="https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/mfa-phishing-on-aws/" target="_blank">technical articles</a>
as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/glzq5yL8LCE" target="_blank">conference talks</a>
around real-time phishing. The primary objective of these tools are to act as standalone tools that form part of a red-team’s, security consultant’s or pentester’s toolkit during security engagements — harvesting user credentials, sessions and 2FA/MFA tokens as well as run post-exploit automation scripts.</p><p>As a phishing simulation platform, PhishDeck’s scope is different, and therefore has different requirements that need to be met, be that performance, scalability or safety. We could have simply turned to popular open-source real-time phishing tools such as <a href="https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2" target="_blank">EvilGinx2</a>
, <a href="https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka" target="_blank">Modlishka</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/muraenateam/muraena" target="_blank">Muraena</a>
and be done with it. However, since PhishDeck is not designed to run red-team exercises or penetration tests (or to be used maliciously), we wanted to make sure that our product is as safe as possible to use for both the person being targeted, and the organization running the simulation.</p><p>On top of this, being the first phishing simulation vendor to incorporate this type of simulation, we wanted to make sure using it was easy to use. This means it needed to be faster, more feature-rich and tightly-knit with the rest of the PhishDeck platform. Users need to be able to be able to simulate real-time phishing campaigns without having to host their own infrastructure, manage domains, or fiddle with HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.</p><p>When we initially started working on a real time phishing simulation proxy we had explored going down the route of developing a hard-fork of EvilGinx2 for a number of reasons.</p><ol><li>It’s open-source license was permissive for private and commercial use;</li><li>A lot of plumbing around service configuration (what EvilGinx2 refers to as phishlets), and Let’s Encrypt certificate generation was already implemented;</li><li>We could use and expand on community-written services, initially thinking it would develop into a fairly large template library without breaking compatibility with our hard-fork;</li><li>Merging with upstream from time to time would not be too difficult as the codebase was fairly small and updates weren’t <strong>too</strong> frequent (e.g. daily).</li></ol><p>We went ahead and developed a heavily stripped down version of EvilGinx2. Implementing some key functionality around client-side code injection (which the project now supports) and security validation via JWT tokens for our users. We also removed a lot of the built-in functionality–no victim sessions (i.e. session database), no interactive terminal, and no credential harvesting. Only the certificate generator and the HTTP phishing proxy.</p><p>As time went on, we started hitting some notable problems that were going to become more and more difficult to overcome, effectively making the hard-fork model unsustainable.</p><ol><li>Using the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/" target="_blank">HTTP-01 challenge type</a>
for TLS certificate generation heavily limited what type of services we could proxy. Our aim was to be able to proxy services that operate on wildcard subdomains (e.g. <code>*.slack.com</code>) that are exceptionally popular and make for very convincing phishing simulations. Achieving this requires us to move to the DNS-01 challenge type, but also requires the service configuration and core proxy to be “wildcard-aware” which is no small feat.</li><li>Community service configurations (i.e. phishlets) didn’t pick up at the frequency that we had originally anticipated. We really wanted to contribute more here, but found ourselves spending too much time on the proxy and very little on adding new services.</li><li>We ended up deviating heavily from upstream, including the core proxy. Merging ended up being a very arduous and manual process, particularly with breaking schema changes around service configurations.</li></ol><p>Key takeaway for us here, as most people in the software industry already know, is that maintaining a hard-fork is difficult. With that said, if we had to go back and face the same decision, we would have proceeded in the same direction. The EvilGinx2 hard-fork was a fantastic proof-of-value and really allowed us to prototype our ideas in the context of a larger phishing simulation platform and gauge our market fit better.</p><p>With a working prototype and a handful of lessons learnt, we went back to the drawing board and fleshed out the requirements for a new in-house proxy. One that is tightly integrated with PhishDeck. We love naming things and our namespace is ripe for all sorts of word play, so we named our new real-time phishing proxy, <strong>Phinn</strong>.</p><p>We came up with a few notable requirements that we had to achieve in order to provide value as well as scale our platform to the general public.</p><ul><li><strong>Wildcard DNS support</strong>. We want to be able to support wildcard domains to be able ro simulate realistic, targeted attacks against a variety of services.</li><li><strong>Performant</strong>. Since we are effectively mirroring/replaying traffic, we are duplicating our response times, making it less likely for Targets to engage with the phishing website and making it costlier for us to operate. Additionally, each PhishDeck user on average will translate to tens or hundreds of Targets, resulting in substantial increase of our proxy traffic when contrasted to our platform traffic.</li><li><strong>Safety</strong>. The objective for Phinn is to <strong>only</strong> proxy traffic for legitimate Targets that form part of a <strong>verified</strong> phishing simulation Campaign and to track specific events with the least amount of event metadata. We <strong>do not</strong> want to process, store or use any user sessions or credentials.</li></ul><p>The scope of the initial proxy was to come up with a crude real-time phishing proxy implementation to gauge the practical soundness of the idea.</p><p>We managed to get a working prototype going over HTTP (no TLS) within a day or so, applied some synthetic HTTP load and monitored CPU/memory usage. Everything fell within our required parameters and so we started laying out the tracks for what version 1.0 would look like. We had to future-proof the design as much as possible as we knew we would not be implementing all features right off the bat.</p><p>We needed to lay the foundations that would serve us for future improvements over the coming years.
The first key design artefact we committed to was the high-level sequence of what a successful proxied request behaves like. This is helpful as it helps better visualise the traffic replay aspect of the proxy and allows us to break down the implementation into smaller segments.</p><p><img src="https://www.phishdeck.com/blog/phinn-on-engineering-a-real-time-phishing-simulation-proxy/proxy-traffic-sequence-flow.png#figure" alt="" title="real-time phishing simulation proxy traffic flow"></p><p>We also needed to factor-in how the phishing proxy would operate with the rest of the PhishDeck platform. It needs to perform as one holistic platform and needs to propagate data from the PhishDeck Campaign, to the Target via the Campaign’s phishing email, to Phinn, all the way back to the same PhishDeck Campaign (full circle).</p><p>After some tweaking and testing we settled on the following set of components. The following diagram may be quite heavy, but I encourage you to take some time and grasp it segment by segment, using the flow markers (i.e. numbers) as your guide.</p><p><img src="https://www.phishdeck.com/blog/phinn-on-engineering-a-real-time-phishing-simulation-proxy/phinn-component-view.png#figure" alt="" title="PhishDeck real-time phishing simulation proxy component view"></p><p><strong>Note</strong> – The way we designed our Callback tokens (step 5 above) are similar to how <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/87338/in-oauth-what-is-the-benefit-of-the-access-token-being-opaque">opaque tokens</a> work in certain OAuth flows. We pack the metadata internally and only push an opaque Callback token (i.e. reference) to the Target. This suits our needs well as it avoids us ever having to pass sensitive Target metadata (e.g. email) over the wire.</p><p>In the platform, we are then able to show interesting metrics and charts for that specific Campaign, specifically the <em>Linked Clicked</em> and <em>Credentials Entered</em> data points, which are two distinct callback tokens that fire in the Target’s browser depending on their activity.</p><p><img src="https://www.phishdeck.com/blog/phinn-on-engineering-a-real-time-phishing-simulation-proxy/phishdeck-campaign-funnel.png#screenshot" alt="" title="PhishDeck Campaign funnel"></p><p>These designs were originally a lot less neat, primarily consisting of whiteboard drafts formalized into interim architecture design records (ADRs). Having such documentation in place early can be invaluable, particularly for software projects with a well-defined problem definition upfront. They act as our north star and allow us to break down seemingly complicated problems into multiple smaller problems to be solved.</p><p>We always eyed Rust as the primary candidate for the new phishing proxy. In the security world, being able to have performance and safety in the same box is rare and Rust fits that to a tee. The largest single defining factor establishing the move to Rust for the core …</p></div></div>

        <h2>How is exploding app growth affecting consumer behavior?</h2>
<p>The mobile app economy is expected to double by 2024 and reach a staggering <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/mobile-app-spending-to-double-by-2024-despite-economic-impacts-of-covid-19/#:~:text=For%20starters%2C%20global%20spending%20in,year%20to%20hit%20%24102%20billion.">$171 billion</a></strong>. That’s roughly the value of the entire <strong><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/market-cap">McDonald’s Corporation</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Is your company looking to carve out a piece of that multi-billion-dollar pie?</p>
<p>With nearly <strong><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-apps-in-app-store-2000252">2 million apps</a></strong> available in Apple’s App Store and <strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1020964/apple-app-store-app-releases-worldwide/#:~:text=Number%20of%20monthly%20Apple%20App%20Store%20app%20releases%20worldwide%202020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20average,through%20the%20Apple%20App%20Store.">30,000 more</a></strong> added every month, so is everyone else.</p>
<p>We wanted to know how the app economy’s exploding growth is affecting consumer behavior, so we surveyed smartphone users to find out.</p>
<p>Specifically, as more brands launch and promote their own mobile apps, we wanted to know how users feel when they’re required to install these apps to place an order, use a product or try a service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did they find it frustrating?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How likely were they to install the app?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How regularly do they delete apps?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does deleting an app affect their opinion of a brand?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our research uncovered 11 app statistics that highlight significant customer pain points with the current state of mobile transactions. Going forward, companies must find solutions to these pain points. Those that don’t risk suffering both decreased market share and irrelevance.</p>
<p>With iOS 14, Apple is giving businesses a solution: <strong>App Clips.</strong></p>
<p>App Clips are small, lightweight portions of your full app that isolate a specific functionality and offer it to users as needed. They integrate seamlessly into tasks mobile users already are performing—such as browsing the web, searching for location-based recommendations or scanning visual tags—and offer brands organic opportunities to step in and provide value.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to rise above the noise in today’s overcrowded mobile app landscape, Apple iOS 14’s new App Clips are a no-brainer.</p>
<p>These 11 app statistics illustrate why.</p>
      </div>
      
      
      


    </div>
  </div><div>
    <div>
      

      
      <div>
        <h3>The Take-Home Message</h3>
<p>Let’s recap what the data tells us about the current mobile app-related purchasing experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>68.5% of mobile phone users are moderately or extremely frustrated when they’re required to install an app to complete a transaction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>77.9% report abandoning a transaction because they didn’t want to install a required app.</strong></li>
<li><strong>30.3% say they’ve saved at least $100 in the last year by abandoning these transactions, with 7.8% saving at least $500.</strong></li>
<li><strong>58.5% who ultimately decide to install the required app still find the whole experience moderately or extremely frustrating and are 65.2% more likely to clean out their app inventory by deleting apps every week.</strong></li>
<li><strong>31.6% say deleting an app makes them think less of the company that created the app.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Where Apps Are Falling Short Today</h3>
<p>Those app statistics paint a clear picture and highlight three purchase-related pain points and inefficiencies:</p>
<p><strong>1. Astounding numbers of abandoned transactions due to that frustration </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Increasing user demand for mobile apps</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Persistent and pervasive consumer frustration with current app-driven checkout processes</strong></p>
<p>Add all that up, and there’s an obvious and growing reservoir of unmet demand waiting to be tapped by businesses that can create seamless online purchasing experiences that facilitate instead of frustrate.</p>
<blockquote>iOS App Clips presents businesses with a high-impact way to increase mobile app downloads, build positive brand sentiment and increase customer engagement by leveraging the functionality currently built into their mobile app.</blockquote>

<h4>iOS 14 is Empowering Brands</h4>
<p>With the introduction of App Clips in iOS 14, Apple is giving businesses a way to do just that by enabling organic, frustration-free, app-powered checkout processes. Now, businesses can embed select portions of their full mobile app’s functionality for customers to interact with natively without requiring installation.</p>
<p>This addresses all three of those pain points and inefficiencies:</p>
<p><strong>1.Customers aren’t required to install an app to complete their transaction and enjoy a smooth, positive experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.Businesses capture more sales. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3.Customers associate their positive experience with both the business’s mobile app and brand, making them more likely to install the full app for future transactions.</strong></p>
<p>iOS App Clips presents companies with a high-impact way to increase mobile app downloads, build positive brand sentiment and increase customer engagement by leveraging the functionality currently built into their mobile app.</p>
<p>And for businesses that don’t have a mobile app but want to take advantage of App Clips to create a customer-centric experience, now is the perfect time to design, build and launch an app with App Clips in mind.</p>

<p><em>I had wrote this before the Unleashed was revealed, so some of the bits on economics have changed. As of writing this, I still stand by my other beliefs. </em>One of the most hyped things in hardware design is RISC-V, the open ISA available without license fees. Many organizations including <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/company/innovations/risc-v">Western Digital</a> have pledged support for RISC-V, and the open source community has a lot of faith in it, and with <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16080/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion">Nvidia’s recent purchase of Arm</a>, people are concerned. However, I feel these hopes are somewhat misleading, as RISC-V’s openness is less at the benefit of the user and more for CPU vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Royalties</strong>. One of the biggest benefits of RISC-V is not having to pay any royalties for a CPU using it. You might pay SiFive or someone else for a realization of their cores on hard silicon, but that’s for the design, not an abstract implementation of the ISA. Openness here means there’s more profit margin on the tiny chips running washing machines, since they don’t have to pay ARM or Synopsys. While the savings could be passed onto you, the ISA’s openness will never be of concern when the program is on a one-time-programmable ROM.</p>



<p><strong>ISA fragmentation</strong>. RISC-V intentionally defines a small ISA with extensions (for example, multiplication, which actually encompasses divide too… which is even more expensive to implement than multiply, but it’s a package deal). While most larger implementations will implement a common set of extensions, having basic functionality in extensions could make software compatibility for binary distributions harder. This is made worse by RISC-V explicitly encouraging custom instructions for task-specific tweaks on vendor silicon – great for embedded, not so hot for general purpose computers and operating systems supporting them.</p>



<p><strong>Economics</strong>. RISC-V has actively courted embedded, which makes sense as a niche. Much of the hype of RISC-V is hoping for laptop/desktop/server class silicon. This is unlikely, because the economics of embedded are different. ISA doesn’t matter as much in embedded programming (code reuse matters, but it’s not like you’re running arbitrary binaries), whereas user/enterprise focused computing usually lives and dies by binary compatibility (to protect investments in existing applications) and performance gained by things most RISC-V implementations don’t have yet like superscalar execution (To say nothing how these impact implementation complexity and security!).</p>



<p><strong>Openness doesn’t tickle down</strong>. The openness of an ISA doesn’t have much impact on the implementation. A design with restricted signing keys is completely acceptable under their licensing – and is very likely, considering the embedded dominance RISC-V is likely to have. There are no guarantees of openness in ways that impact a user (i.e controlling the root of trust), since a user doesn’t exactly have access to a fab.</p>



<p><strong>Design flaws</strong>. RISC-V seems like it hasn’t learned anything from CPUs designed after 1991. Between some <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">rookie mistakes</a> like few <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/yqqhxu/llvm_for_m68k_completed_not_merged">addressing modes</a> (register churn, code density) and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/icegvf/will_risc_v_revolutionize_computing#c_8wbb6t">blowing out the encoding space</a>. However, despite its flaws, it’s poised to take over embedded and possibly beyond anyways – worse truly is better.</p>



<p>Overall, RISC-V will lead in a revolution for nationalist vanity CPUs (think Loongson; no one will run them but for show and perhaps a niche of radical ideologues) , academic projects, and embedded vendors wanting to save on their balance sheets, but it probably won’t affect users or developers.</p>

<p>On January 27th, starting at 4:31UTC we were hit with increasing amounts of traffic from what appeared to be hundreds of different IP addresses mostly belonging to Amazon Web Service IP addresses. At 8:46UTC the inbound traffic overwhelmed our systems and brought nearly all of our services to a standstill.</p>



<p>After investigating the situation and receiving no meaningful assistance from Hetzner (our ISP who advertises DDoS mitigation services as part of their offerings) we blocked three subnets of IP addresses in order to restore our services. At 13:14UTC we put the block in place and our services started recovering.</p>



<p>We reported the issue to Hetzner and to AWS shortly after restoring our service. The next morning we received a friendly email from Andy, who works for one of our supporters at <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>, stating that they received a complaint from AWS. What happened next and how this matter was resolved is told by Andy himself:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Overnight on Wednesday, first thing Thursday morning, we received an abuse report that our servers were flooding an IP that corresponded to musicbrainz.org. We scrambled to investigate, as we are happy MusicBrainz partners, but it was a strange report because we run our MusicBrainz server and hit that instance rather than communicating with musicbrainz.org directly. And the IPs mentioned were specifically related to our metadata servers, not the IPs that would be receiving data updates from upstream. Just as some of our key engineering team members were starting to wake up and scrub in, it started to seem that it was a coincidence and we weren’t the actual source of the traffic and had simply been caught up in an overeager blocking of a large IP range to get the services back up. Never trust a coincidence. We continued to stay in touch with the team at MusicBrainz and within a few hours we had clear evidence that our IPs were the source of the traffic. We got the whole engineering team involved again to do some investigation, and we still couldn’t figure much out since we never make requests to musicbrainz.org and we had already worked to rule out the potential of any rogue access to our servers. By isolating our services and using our monitoring tools, we finally discovered that the issue was actually our traffic to coverartarchive.org, not musicbrainz.org, as they happen to be serviced by the same IP address. And this made much more sense, as we do depend on some API calls to the Cover Art Archive.</em></p><p><em>The root cause was an update to the Plex Media Server which had been released earlier in the week. There was a bug in that update that caused extra metadata requests to our own infrastructure. We had noticed the spike in our autoscaling to accommodate the extra traffic and already put together another update to fix the bug. That extra traffic on our infrastructure also translated to a more modest increase in requests to some of our metadata partners, including CAA. While the fix was already rolling out to Plex Media Servers, this provided a good opportunity to evaluate the CAA traffic and put our own rate limit in place to protect against future issues. We wrapped up that change in the afternoon on Thursday.</em></p><p><em>Throughout the ordeal, we appreciated the communication back and forth with our partners at MusicBrainz so that we could work together to investigate and follow leads to find a timely resolution.</em></p><cite>Andy from Plex</cite></blockquote>



<p>While this whole situation was very stressful and frustrating to us, in the end it was resolved by a very friendly and technical detective game to identify and resolve the issue. It is always nice when geeks talk to geeks to resolve issues and get services working again. Thank you to Andy and his team — let’s hope we can avoid an issue like this in the future.</p>



<p>We’d apologize for the trouble caused by our IP address block and for our services being unavailable for several hours.</p>



<p>EDIT: We should also mention that all of our services are served from one single gateway IP address, so coverartarchive.org and musicbrainz.org have the same IP address.</p>

February 2, 2021 | http://morrick.me/archives/9150 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://morrick.me/archives/9150">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Yesterday, a short <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1355514848717791234">Twitter thread</a> by the excellent <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/">Jeff Johnson</a> caught my eye. Since he often deletes past tweets, I’ll quote the relevant ones here (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The selling point of the Macintosh was never the hardware, it was the user interface. So if the selling point now is the hardware, that’s a damning indictment of the current user interface.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I cannot emphasize enough how everyone seems to have lowered their standards with regard to the user interface.</strong> The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a>” has moved. The Overton window now has rounded rects.</p>

<p>We’ve gone from “insanely great” and “It just works” to “Catalyst is good enough for most people.”</p>
<p>That’s fucking BS, and I won’t tolerate it.</p>

<p>Windows is “good enough for most people”. That’s why Windows has a 90% market share. Why should we aspire to that level, shouldn’t we have much higher aspirations? Mac is a niche. “Most people” are not even using Macs, so the majority is not even relevant. Mac is a premium brand.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the Mac now is merely milking the brand reputation and loyalty it previously built. That Jobs previously built. But neither Cook nor the current Mac deserves that reputation or loyalty.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs wasn’t an engineer. Not a hardware engineer, not a software engineer. At Apple, his role was as “proxy” for the&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>Apple no longer has a proxy for the users. Tim Cook is a proxy for the shareholders, nothing more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeff himself says that this criticism is hardly new, that these are things he already pointed out “a thousand times, to no effect”. While I am in no position to affect Apple or Mac development, this short Twitter rant had the effect of reminding me of something I, too, believe in; something I myself should emphasise more frequently. It’s those first two tweets I’ve quoted above.</p>
<p>As someone who still puts vintage Macs and older computers and devices to good use, the Mac’s user interface and user experience are in large part what still makes using 15–20-year-old machines enjoyable. This, by the way, also applies to other products of course. It’s thanks to well-designed user interfaces that we enjoy driving a classic car, or shooting with a 50-year-old film camera, or listening to vinyl records on a 40-year-old record-player and hi-fi stereo.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was on a group videochat with some friends and when I said that, frankly, using my 12-inch PowerBook G4 (2003) with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was more enjoyable than using my 13-inch retina MacBook Pro (2015) with Mac OS 11 Big Sur, the common reaction was that I was just being ‘nostalgic’; that surely my MacBook Pro was the better choice because it is orders of magnitude faster, with a ‘more modern’ OS, and that the sum of those parts was a better Mac experience. That I should ‘be rational’ and accept that.</p>
<p>Here, bringing up nostalgia is missing the point. And the point is that an admittedly faster hardware plus a purportedly ‘more modern’ operating system <em>do not necessarily</em> equal a better Mac experience. It’s interesting that my friends’ reaction was not to ask me <em>why</em> I was finding using an 18-year-old machine more enjoyable than an up-to-date Mac, but to promptly want to readjust my enjoyment, implying that there was something ‘wrong’ with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I’m finding that many people not only have lowered their standards with regard to the user interface, but more and more often when I bring up the subject, they seem to consider it a somewhat secondary aspect, something that’s only good for ‘geek talk’. The same kind of amused reaction laymen have to wine or coffee connoisseurs when they describe flavours and characteristics using specific lingo. Something that makes sense only to wine or coffee geeks but has little to no meaning or impact for the regular person.</p>
<p>The problem is that if an increasing number of people start viewing user interface design as an afterthought, or something that isn’t fundamental to the design of a product or experience — it’s all just ‘geek talk’ — then there is a reduced incentive to care about it on the part of the maker of the product. It’s more like a vicious circle, really; if Apple software’s quality declines but only a bunch of professional users and enthusiasts point that out, then Apple isn’t particularly incentivised to do a better job at it — the “good enough for most people” is really a dangerous, self-indulgent excuse. And in turn most people are fine with it, and in turn Apple think they’re on a ‘good’ path, and so&nbsp;forth.</p>
<p>At the very end of my piece <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9141"><em> What about the M1 Macs?</em></a>, I&nbsp;wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>They’re unbelievably good machines, and everything that is genuinely good about them and future Apple Silicon-based Macs — sheer performance, astounding power-efficiency, and great backward compatibility with Intel software thanks to Rosetta 2 — will also allow Apple to get away with a lot of things with regard to platform control, design decisions, and so&nbsp;forth.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you take a look at Jason Snell’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/01/apple-in-2020-the-six-colors-report-card/"><em>Apple in 2020: The Six Colors report card</em></a>, the Mac scored very good points overall, 4.7 out of 5, with a year-over-year increment of 1.1 points. The main reason has been of course the M1 Macs and Apple Silicon. Don’t get me wrong, Apple Silicon <em>is</em> groundbreaking, and Rosetta 2 is really an incredible performer on the software side. But what I contend is that a leap in hardware architecture and performance doesn’t necessarily mean that suddenly all is fine with the Mac as a platform or as an experience.</p>
<p>The Mac’s user interface is undergoing plastic surgery by the hand of surgeons who have studied on iOS books. The result is pretty much the same as when you see a favourite celebrity after a procedure. They look ‘younger’ but there’s also something weird about their appearance. Their traits have changed a bit. In certain cases you almost fail to recognise the person at first glance.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Mac experience today feels disjointed. The hardware has unquestionably improved with the introduction of Apple Silicon, and yes, it’s something worth celebrating and it’s something worth praising. On the other hand, the software that drives this hardware is a bit of a paradox: Big Sur and Apple Silicon Macs fit and work together well from a technical, architectural standpoint. From a user interface standpoint, however, Big Sur embodies what I’ve been fearing in recent years — a progressive iOS-ification of Mac OS. Big Sur provides a general user experience that is the least Mac-like in the history of the Mac. Going through Big Sur’s user interface with a fine-tooth comb reveals arbitrary design decisions that prioritise looks over function, and therefore reflect an un-learning of tried-and-true user interface and usability mechanics that used to make for a seamless, thoughtful, enjoyable Mac experience.</p>
<p>iOS was born as a ‘spinoff’ of Mac OS X, a sort of Lite version aimed at mobile devices like the iPhone and the iPod touch. The two platforms have maintained their separate paths and trajectories for years, and for a while using a Mac and an iPhone (or iPad) felt like having the best experience of each world. Then Apple became obsessed with thoughts of convergence, and features, UI ideas, paradigms, started bleeding through both platforms and in turn the respective experiences have become less clear-cut over time, with the software not fully capable of bringing out all that hardware power and potential.</p>
<p>This convergence will continue, of course, with Macs becoming more and more like ‘senior iOS devices’ from a UI and user experience standpoint. It seems clear to me that Apple is prioritising ecosystem experience because, let’s be honest, having a unified ‘operating system core’ underlying all platforms means having fewer framework-specific headaches and probably a faster, streamlined process when deploying new features. But this loss of differentiation is especially detrimental to Mac OS, which is being reduced to the lowest common denominator and loses an increasing amount of user interface ideas and conventions that were central to its superior user experience and ease of&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>I’m not annoyed because I see pieces of UI history fading away. I’m annoyed because I see pieces of <em>good</em> UI design fading away and being replaced by decisions that are puzzling and arbitrary, or the product of a trial-and-error process, rather than a meaningful, purposeful design.</p>
<p>You want an example that I find particularly glaring? Big Sur’s UI features a general increase of space between elements — icons, menus, labels, toolbars, sidebars, pretty much everywhere. On the surface it doesn’t seem like a bad decision. If you zoom in on certain parts of the user interface, you could say that more space between elements means that things looks cleaner, airier, sleeker.</p>
<p>But you’re looking at it on a 27-inch retina display. What about a display half that size? What about an 11-inch, non-retina display, like the one of the older 2013–2015 MacBook Airs that can be updated to Big Sur? It’s less pretty.</p>

<p>I usually work with a lot of app windows and Finder windows, but when I’m using my 13-inch retina MacBook Pro with Big Sur, the workspace constantly feels cramped, while on the other hand I have no problems using High Sierra on my 11-inch MacBook Air. Sometimes it feels like looking at a zoomed-in interface. That increased space between elements becomes less of a good idea because it doesn’t scale gracefully when the overall screen real estate is reduced. It becomes an interference. Before installing Big Sur, the amount of icons on the right of the menu bar had never really been a concern. Now, the simple addition of a couple of third-party apps like Dropbox and iStat Menus — both essential for me — is enough to make that menu bar look crowded. (And thankfully Apple has been reducing the space between menu icons, because in the first Big Sur betas icon padding was so bad I had to remove a few icons and use Control Centre to check on their status).</p>
<p>This, like other UI design decisions in Big Sur, feels like …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/examples/getting-started.ipynb"><img alt="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"></a></p><p>CompilerGym is a toolkit for applying reinforcement learning to compiler
optimization tasks. This document provides a short walkthrough of the key
concepts, using the codesize reduction task of a production-grade compiler
as an example. It will take about 20 minutes to work through. Lets get
started!</p>

<div id="key-concepts">
<h2><a href="#id3">Key Concepts</a><a href="#key-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CompilerGym exposes compiler optimization problems as environments for
reinforcement learning. It uses the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>
interface to expose the “agent-environment loop” of reinforcement learning:</p>
<p><img alt="_images/overview.png" src="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/_images/overview.png"></p><p>The ingredients for reinforcement learning that CompilerGym provides are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>: a compiler optimization task. For example,
<em>optimizing a C++ graph-traversal program for codesize using LLVM</em>. The
environment encapsulates an instance of a compiler and a particular program
that is being compiled. As an agent interacts with the environment, the state
of the program, and the compiler, can change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Space</strong>: the actions that may be taken at the current environment
state. For example, this could be a set of optimization transformations that
the compiler can apply to the program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation</strong>: a view of the current environment state. For example, this
could be the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program that is being
compiled. The types of observations that are available depend on the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward</strong>: a metric indicating the quality of the previous action. For
example, for a codesize optimization task this could be the change to the
number of instructions of the previous action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A single instance of this “agent-environment loop” represents the compilation of
a particular program. The goal is to develop an agent that maximises the
cumulative reward from these environments so as to produce the best programs.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2><a href="#id4">Installation</a><a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Install the latest CompilerGym release using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The binary works on macOS and Linux (on Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 28, Debian
10 or newer equivalents).</p>
<div id="building-from-source">
<h3><a href="#id5">Building from Source</a><a href="#building-from-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you prefer, you may build from source. This requires a modern C++
toolchain. On macOS you can use the system compiler. On linux, install
the required toolchain using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo apt install clang libtinfo5 patchelf
$ export CC=clang
$ export CXX=clang++
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We recommend using
<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/">conda</a>
to manage the remaining build dependencies. First create a conda
environment with the required dependencies:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ conda create -n compiler_gym python=3.8 bazel=3.1.0 cmake pandoc
$ conda activate compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then clone the CompilerGym source code using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym.git
$ cd CompilerGym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Install the python development dependencies using:</p>

<p>Then run the test suite to confirm that everything is working:</p>

<p>To build and install the python package, run:</p>

<p>When you are finished, you can deactivate and delete the conda
environment using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ conda deactivate
$ conda env remove -n compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="using-compilergym">
<h2><a href="#id6">Using CompilerGym</a><a href="#using-compilergym" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Begin by firing up a python interpreter:</p>

<p>To start with we import the gym module and the CompilerGym environments:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> <span>gym</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> <span>compiler_gym</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Importing <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/compiler_gym.html#module-compiler_gym" title="compiler_gym"><code><span>compiler_gym</span></code></a> automatically registers the compiler environments.</p>
<p>We can see what environments are available using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>compiler_gym</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILER_GYM_ENVS</span>
<span>['llvm-v0', 'llvm-ic-v0', 'llvm-autophase-ic-v0', 'llvm-ir-ic-v0']</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div id="selecting-an-environment">
<h3><a href="#id7">Selecting an environment</a><a href="#selecting-an-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CompilerGym environments are named using one of the following formats:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;observation&gt;-&lt;reward&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;reward&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where <code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;</span></code> identifiers the compiler optimization task,
<code><span>&lt;observation&gt;</span></code> is the default type of observations that are provided,
and <code><span>&lt;reward&gt;</span></code> is the reward signal.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A key concept is that
CompilerGym environments enables <strong>lazy evaluation</strong> of observations and
reward signals. This makes the environment much more computationally
efficient for scenarios in which you do not need to compute a reward or
observation for every step. If an environment omits a <code><span>&lt;observation&gt;</span></code>
or <code><span>&lt;reward&gt;</span></code> tag, this means that no observation or reward is
provided by default. See <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/views.html"><span>compiler_gym.views</span></a> for
further details.</p>
</div>
<p>For this tutorial, we will use the following environment:</p>
<ul>

<p>A compiler requires a program as input. For the purposes of CompilerGym we call
these input programs <em>benchmarks</em>, and collections of benchmarks are assembled
into <em>datasets</em>. You may provide your own programs to use as benchmarks, or
download one of our pre-assembled datasets.</p>
<p>The benchmarks that are available to an environment can be queried using

               <h3>
                  A discovery in theoretical physics could help to unravel the mysteries of dark matter
               </h3>
               <p>
                  1 February 2021
               </p>
               <p>
                  Theoretical physicists of the PRISMA<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;Cluster of Excellence at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) are working on a theory that goes beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and can answer questions where the Standard Model has to pass – for example, with respect to the hierarchies of the masses of elementary particles or the existence of dark matter. The central element of the theory is an extra dimension in spacetime. Until now, scientists have faced the problem that the predictions of their theory could not be tested experimentally. They have now overcome this problem in a publication in the current issue of the <em>European Physical Journal C</em>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Already in the 1920s, in an attempt to unify the forces of gravity and electromagnetism, Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein speculated about the existence of an extra dimension beyond the familiar three space dimensions and time – which in physics are combined into 4-dimensional spacetime. If it exists, such a new dimension would have to be incredible tiny and unnoticeable to the human eye. In the late 1990s, this idea has seen a remarkable renaissance&nbsp;when it was realized that the existence of a fifth dimension could resolve some of the profound open questions of particle physics. In particular, Yuval Grossman of Stanford University and Matthias Neubert, then a professor at Cornell University in the US, showed in a highly cited publication that the embedding of the Standard Model of particle physics in a 5-dimensional spacetime could explain the so far mysterious patterns seen in the masses of elementary particles.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Another 20 years later, the group of Professor Matthias Neubert – since 2006 on the faculty of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and spokesperson of the PRISMA<sup>+</sup> Cluster of Excellence – made another unexpected discovery: they found that the 5-dimensional field equations predicted the existence of a new&nbsp;heavy particle with similar properties as the famous Higgs boson but a much heavier mass – so heavy, in fact, that it cannot be produced even at the highest-energy particle collider in the world,&nbsp;the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Center for Nuclear Research CERN near Geneva in Switzerland. "It was a nightmare,"&nbsp;recalled&nbsp;Javier Castellano Ruiz, a PhD student involved in the research.&nbsp;"We were excited by the idea that our theory predicts a new particle, but it appeared to be impossible to confirm this prediction in any foreseeable experiment."
               </p>
               <h4>
                  The detour through the fifth dimension
               </h4>
               <p>
                  In a recent paper published in the <em>European Physical Journal C</em>, the researchers found a spectacular resolution to this dilemma. They discovered that their proposed particle would necessarily mediate a new force between the known elementary particles of our visible universe&nbsp;and the mysterious dark matter, the dark sector. Even the abundance of dark matter in the cosmos, as observed in astrophysical experiments, can be explained by their theory. This offers exciting new ways to search for the constituents of the dark matter – literally via a detour through the extra dimension – and obtain clues about the physics at a very early stage in the history of our universe, when dark matter was produced. "After years of searching for possible confirmations of our theoretical predictions, we are now confident that the mechanism we have discovered would make dark matter accessible to forthcoming experiments, because the properties of the new interaction between ordinary matter and dark matter – which is mediated by our proposed particle – can be calculated accurately within our theory,"&nbsp;said Professor Matthias Neubert, head of the research team. "In the end – so our hope – the new particle may be discovered first through its interactions with the dark sector."&nbsp;This example nicely illustrates the fruitful interplay between experimental and theoretical basic science – a hallmark of the PRISMA<sup>+</sup> Cluster of Excellence.

Our goal with this updated license is to be as permissive as possible while including a minimum set of protections. I hope these protections make sense. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license/faq">See our FAQ</a> for more information about ELv2.
</p><div><p>We created ELv2 to hopefully allow others to adopt it. This is the license we wished was available in 2015 when we were a small company facing <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">misinformation</a>. It incorporates all of our learnings from our experience and others who have made similar changes (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/">RedisLabs</a>, <a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/">TimescaleDB</a>, <a href="https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl">Graylog</a>, etc.). Hopefully we helped a little here. There are many companies out there facing a similar decision. I hope that over time, those of us with similar goals can coalesce around a smaller number of licenses and that ELv2 will be a catalyst for that.</p><p>In that spirit, we worked on ELv2 with <a href="https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/">Heather Meeker</a>, a lawyer who is well known for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as helping a number of organizations build similar-in-spirit licenses like the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/">Confluent Community License</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">SSPL</a>, and others. We are also reaching out to initiatives like the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">Polyform Project</a> and <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a> as additional efforts to raise awareness of this license and look for ways to promote its wider use.&nbsp;
</p></div><h2>SSPL remains an option for the source code
</h2><div><p>We added <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a>, which is a copyleft license created by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, as an option to minimize the effect this license change would have on our users. MongoDB is one of the most popular projects out there, used by millions of developers who are happy with SSPL. </p><p>Since we made this announcement, we had many of our users reach out and say that they are thankful we provided this option. Their organizations are already using MongoDB, and this made our license change a non-event for them.</p><p>The SSPL is a licensing option for the source code, as shown below:
</p></div><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd65944c1b54a1e0b/6018987f29a02c49ba1f3e4a/chart-license-update-2021.jpg"></p><p>And to be clear, we are <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/20/Righteous-Expedient-Wrong.html">still</a> not claiming that either SSPL or the Elastic License are OSI-approved licenses.
</p><h2>Still no impact to our cloud and on-premises customers&nbsp;
</h2><p>It is important to repeat: there is no impact to any of our Elastic Cloud or self-managed customers. Our customers already use the default distribution under the Elastic License, and their use is governed by the terms of their subscription agreement, which continues to grant them access to additional features, access to support, and other Elastic commitments (for example, IP infringement indemnification) as before.
</p><h2>The path forward
</h2><p>These changes, including making the Elastic License more permissive, are intended to help us focus on building great products and investing in our community. This means building more great features, many of which we will provide for free and which will be developed in the open. But our commitment goes beyond the code. These license changes let us focus on what matters: helping you find success with our products.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With the arrival of new, more contagious variants of COVID-19 in Canada, experts are recommending an upgrade in the quality—and quantity—of our face coverings</p><div>
																		<p><span>Look at photos of </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/double-mask-coronavirus_ca_60140605c5b653f644d2ed5b?ncid=tweetlnkcahpmg00000002"><span>President Joe Biden and you’ll notice he often wears two masks</span></a><span>: a light cloth or paper one over a heavy-duty N95 mask. “If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on,” </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/dr-fauci-double-mask-during-covid-makes-common-sense-more-effective.html"><span>said Dr. Anthony Fauci</span></a><span>, who has also frequently </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MayorBowser/status/1341835973722734592?s=20"><span>worn two masks</span></a><span>. “It just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But there is also some urgency to this shift: With the arrival of new and more contagious variants to Canada, experts are asking everyone to think once again about the quality of our masks and how we use them. “We all need a bit of a reset regarding [COVID-19] precautions,” says Dr. Lynora Saxinger, </span><span>an infectious diseases physician in Edmonton. “We tend to cut corners and relax when something becomes commonplace.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For one thing, she says,</span><span> don’t shove a mask into your pocket after wearing it; if you’re asymptomatic, then the virus will be easily transferred from the mask to your hands. For another, don’t be complacent regarding the type and quality of your face coverings, such as masks that are comfortable to wear because they use porous materials, or </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html#a9"><span>neck gaiters, which can easily slip</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In fact, many of the masks we’re using aren’t as good as they should be. And, unlike last spring when the initial guidance around masks included recommending face coverings of tightly woven fabric, the risk perception has now changed. The new variants are so much more effective at infecting people that it’s time for a refresher course in face protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html"><span>Health Canada’s guidelines</span></a><span> emphasize that masks need proper structure, material and fit to reduce the spread of infectious respiratory droplets. For example, Saxinger uses a couple of well-fitted multi-layer fabric masks, each with added filters of polypropylene material which she bought separately, in addition to cycling through lightly-worn medical masks, which she stores in separate envelopes for a few days before using them. And now, unlike in the spring, medical-quality disposable masks as well as more tightly fitted KN95 masks are available through retailers</span> <span>including </span><a href="https://www.costco.ca/kn95-disposable-5-layer-face-mask%2C-20-pack.product.100672009.html"><span>Costco</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.canadiansafetysupplies.com/Level-2-Hospital-Medical-3-Ply-Surgical-Masks-p/350117.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6t6ABhDMARIsAONIYywfEhF1lBHDuf6XEc1nB9jQgZ_kni7_n69ikdQ7cCcEJJR2jNETNncaAti8EALw_wcB"><span>health care supply firms</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wellwise.ca/en-ca/products/total-care-kn95-mask"><span>pharmacies</span></a><span> (supplies can fluctuate; also, many of the disposable masks and KN95s on the market are not medical grade).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>While there is no official Canadian or U.S. guidance regarding double-masking or the need to upgrade to better quality masks, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/26/960893423/some-european-countries-move-to-require-medical-grade-masks-in-public"><span>Germany, Austria and France</span></a><span> recently told their residents to upgrade their face coverings from cloth versions to specific medical-grade ones, including KN95s, when they are in public spaces, including stores, or when near others for a prolonged period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The more layers the better, as long as they are breathable,” says Saxinger. Doubling up with whatever masks you have—whether two cloth ones, or a cloth and a disposable one—can offer more protection, as they can provide another layer of filtration and force a tighter fit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Many people, even among security experts and privacy advocates, hold the firm
belief that WhatsApp is more <em>secure</em> and privacy-wise better than Telegram.
After having thoroughly studied the issue, I do not believe this to be true.
In this article I will try to highlight the necessary facts to enable the
reader to form a more informed opinion on the matter.</p>

</section>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Most sources which praise WhatsApp and criticize Telegram make bold claims,
presenting them as objective truth, without
sufficiently motivating them or backing them up with facts. In many cases they
rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">arguments from authority</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Telegram] By default, it is less safe than @WhatsApp, which makes [it] dangerous
for non-experts. — <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/778597417797226496" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ed. Snowden (Sep, 2016)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realize that many of you will be sceptical now. After all, if Edward Snowden
said so, it <em>must</em> be true. Why would you question it? And why, above all, should we <em>believe</em> you instead?</p>
<p>Well, the point is exactly this. I am not asking you to believe <em>me</em>, but to
evaluate the facts, with an open mind, before forming an opinion.
Moreover, even if it might be hard to accept, even heroes and geniuses like Edward
Snowden can be wrong from time to time!</p>
<p>I made a good faith attempt to research all the facts and present them as
objectively as possible, without including personal biases. However, please
keep in mind that I do not consider myself infallible, and thus there might be
some mistakes. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>




<h2 id="fallacies">The fallacies</h2>
<p>The vast majority of things I read on this topic can be reduced to a combination
of the following factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not considering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">threat model</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_premise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">false premise</a> that end-to-end encryption alone is a necessary and
sufficient condition for good security and privacy.</li>
<li>The erroneous conclusion that everything that is not end-to-end encrypted is
inherently less secure and must be avoided at all cost.</li>
<li>The huge respect for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Moxie Marlinspike</a>, one of the authors of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">end-to-end encryption protocol</a> used by WhatsApp and
Signal, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">arguments from authority</a>.</li>
<li>Outright lies about the insecurity of the cryptographic protocol used by
Telegram.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the article is dedicated to amply clarify each of the points
above. In <a href="#threat-models">section 3</a> I will articulate the importance of considering threat
models when trying to determine if a system is <em>secure</em>. In <a href="">section 4</a>
I will discuss end-to-end encryption, the challenges that it entails and how it
is implemented in WhatsApp and Telegram. In <a href="#telegram">section 5</a> I will address the most
common criticisms of Telegram, and finally, in <a href="#conclusion">section 6</a>, I will draw some conclusions.</p>


<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”. — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Searching on Hacker News for <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=%22whatsapp%20is%20more%20secure%22&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“WhatsApp is more secure”</a>
yields some typical comments from people arguing that WhatsApp is more secure
than Telegram</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telegram is more fun (bots and stickers), but <strong>WhatsApp is more secure</strong>
(no messages on server, no rolled-your-own-crypto). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14374644" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even that Telegram is the least secure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can anyone call “Telegram” secure? Those days are over. It’s the least
secure messaging app of them all now. <strong>Even WhatsApp is more secure than
Telegram</strong> (let alone Threema). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13032192" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, what does it really mean that WhatsApp is <em>more secure</em>? Secure against the
government? Secure against your friendly neighbourhood hacker snooping on
the Wi-Fi at Starbucks?
Secure against throwing rocks at your phone? Secure against your mom trying to
read your messages?</p>
<p>Defending from an adversary with practically unlimited budget and computational
resources, such as a powerful government, is going to be much harder than
defending against a curious neighbour sniffing on your Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>Saying that WhatsApp is more secure than Telegram,
without specifying against what kind of adversary or against what kind of threat,
does not mean much.</strong></p>

<p>Without considering these questions and only craving for <em>“more security”</em>, <strong>is
not necessarily a smart thing</strong> either.
In the same way that putting your possessions in a nuclear bunker
might be more secure, in
case of a nuclear war, than locking them in a small safe in your room, but could
not be the best choice if all you are trying to do is protect your Blu-ray
collection from your flatmate!
Moreover, <strong>increasing security is often not free</strong>, because
it increases complexity, thus development cost, and can decrease usability. Exactly like a nuclear bunker
is going to be much more expensive than a small safe and is also not going to be
as easy to use.
Lastly, it is important to note that <strong>you are as secure as the weakest link in your system</strong>.
Therefore, if you want a nuclear bunker, with all the challenges and costs that
it entails, but then forget to put a lock on its door, it might not protect you that
much after all.</p>


<p>Consequently, let us now try to examine which of the <em>components</em> involved in
using a messaging app can be potentially attacked by a malicious agent,
compromising our security.
For each of these, <em>you</em> need to establish if you blindly trust it to function
correctly, or if you believe it could be compromised and thus need to find a way
to defend it from the potential threat.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The companies running the servers needed by the app to work</strong>. That is,
Facebook, Telegram and whatever other third party services they decide to
use or share your data with.<ol>
<li>Are you OK with them being able to read your messages?</li>
<li>Do you trust them on keeping your data safe? So that it does not get
stolen, for example.</li>
<li>Are you OK with them selling your data or meta-data to advertisers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The app itself</strong>. That is, the WhatsApp or Telegram apps on your
phone.<ol>
<li>Do you trust that it does exactly what it says and is not malicious? For
example that it is always encrypting your messages.</li>
<li>Do you trust its developers to be good citizens and not insert backdoors?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The communication medium</strong>. That is, the Internet.<ol>
<li>Do you trust the connection between you and the app’s servers to be
secure?</li>
<li>Do you trust your ISP?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The distribution and update process</strong>. For example, the Play Store, App
Store or F-Droid. Do you trust Google and Apple to give you the real app,
and not a specially crafted one to spy on you?</li>
<li><strong>The other apps on your phone</strong>. Do you trust all the other apps on your
phone, or do you think some of them might be malware?</li>
<li><strong>The OS</strong>. That is, Android or iOS. Do you trust your
operative system and its developers (e.g. Google, Samsung, Apple)? For example,
do you trust that no malicious actor can remotely <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/gaps-in-google-play-store-xfo-allow-attackers-to-remotely-install-malware-on-android-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">install</a>
or <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/06/exercising-our-remote-application.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">uninstall</a> software on your device?</li>
<li><strong>The firmware and the hardware</strong>. Do you trust your phone is not running
malware at the firmware or hardware level,
<a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/SamsungGalaxyBackdoor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">like it was discovered on Samsung phones in 2014</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew, that was quite a list!</p>
<p>But, <strong>do we really need to care about all of this stuff?</strong> Well, not many
people do.
However, if you want to evaluate which messaging app best suits your needs and
you care a bit about security and privacy, then it is essential.
This process will enable you to decide for yourself, without basing your decision
on some tweet saying that one app is <em>more secure</em> than the other.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is important to reiterate that if you are worried that a powerful
adversary, like a government, might want to directly target you (as opposed to
compromise you as part of a mass surveillance program), you cannot defend only
against one attack vector and ignore the others.
You can have the most secure messaging app in the world, but if your phone can be hacked
with an SMS, there is not much of a difference.</p>


<p>You might wonder why couldn’t we just try to defend ourselves against all possible
threats and attacks. It is because, as we said before and as we will show in more
detail in the next section, increasing security is not free but comes
with the cost of increased complexity and very often decreased usability.</p>

<h2 id="e2ee">End-to-end encryption</h2>
<p>Let us now address the most common reason that induces people to believe that
WhatsApp is a better choice: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p>

<p>WhatsApp describes end-to-end encryption (or E2EE for short) in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person you’re communicating
with can read or listen to what is sent, and nobody in between, not even
WhatsApp. This is because with end-to-end encryption, your messages are
secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key
needed to unlock and read them. All of this happens automatically: no need to
turn on any special settings to secure your messages. — <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>WhatsApp nowadays has end-to-end encryption enabled by default for all chats,
while Telegram has not enabled it by default and does not support it on group
chats.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a very nice property to have. If implemented correctly it
allows us to communicate securely, even in the case in which the server (i.e.
WhatsApp or Telegram) cannot be trusted and is considered malicious.
However, if we decide to go down this road and not trust any more the companies
running our app, we introduce a series of new complications.</p>
<p>However, one could argue that even in the case in which we decide to trust the
Service, it is beneficial to have end-to-end encryption. This is a valid point because, while
we might trust the Service, for sure we do not trust some potential malicious
actors compromising the Service’s infrastructure and getting access to our data. In
this scenario our data should still be safe because not even the Service has
access to it, and therefore an attacker cannot steal the decryption key nor
coerce the Service to disclose it. This is the major strength of
E2EE.

<p>Welcome to the forty-fifth issue of Racket News.</p>

<div><p><img src="https://racket-news.com/img/issue45/happybday-2021.jpg" alt=""></p></div>

<p>Today the is second birthday of Racket News. The first issue was released exactly 2 years ago on Feb 1st, 2019. A lot has happened in Racket in the last few years and it’s going stronger than ever : as a language, implementation, and community. Many thanks to all of you who have been following Racket News, sending suggestions for improvements and contributions to the issues. Cheers to a new year!</p>

<p>With the good news out of the way, my apologies for the delayed issue. We missed the mid-month issue in January as I had a rough start of the year but I am now on the right track and things should proceed as normal. The next issue should be here on February 15th, and the following one on March 1st.</p>

<p>Grab a coffee and lets dive in!</p>

<p>This week’s project in the spotlight is <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/resyntax/index.html"><code>resyntax</code></a> by Jack Firth.</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Resyntax is a refactoring tool for Racket. The tool can be guided by refactoring rules, which are macro-like functions defined in terms of syntax-parse that specify how to search for and refactor different coding patterns.</p>
 <p>This tool is extremely experimental. Do not attempt to incorporate it into your projects yet. For now, the refactoring suggestions produced by resyntax are best viewed as glimpses into one possible distant future of static analysis for Racket. Feedback, questions, and ideas are all greatly appreciated and are best directed at the GitHub repository.</p>
 <p>Resyntax does not have anything approaching a public API yet. If you want to actually try using it, open the source code of the resyntax module using DrRacket’s “Open Require Path” menu option, change the file path given to the refactor-file! function in the main submodule, then run it. Choosing a file checked into Git (or another version control system) is highly recommended in order to make it easier to view the diff and easier to undo the changes.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s unusual for me to spotlight a recently released project but I find that one of the things that are really needed in the Racket ecosystem are devtools like these, therefore this is a spotlight for the experimental version. I hope it excites you as much as it does me.</p>





<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wtaSi4HUG8S2P6gyLks1DTkr04hIbWYf/view?usp=sharing">Programming Languages as Operating Systems (or Revenge of the Son of the Lisp Machine)</a> by Matthew Flatt, Robert Findler, Shriram Krishnamurti, and Matthias Felleisen.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>The MrEd virtual machine serves both as the implementation platform for the DrScheme programming environment, and as the underlying Scheme engine for executing expressions and programs entered into DrScheme’s read-eval-print loop. We describe the key elements of the MrEd virtual machine for building a programming environment, and we step through the implementation of a miniature version of DrScheme in MrEd. More generally, we show how MrEd defines a high-level operating system for graphical programs.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Http2SQL is a free api which will allow you to query any SQL database from an HTTP request.
It uses <a href="https://sequelize.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sequelize</a> to handle the connection</p>
<p>It's free to use and doesn't require an API key or authentication. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Cosbgn/zero-labs/blob/master/api/http2sql.js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<p>With Zero you can build great interactive dashboards pulling data directly from your SQL database! It's free!
Give it a try at <a href="https://zero.sh/play" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://zero.sh/play</a></p>
<h2 id="1-make-sure-that-your-request-is-private-and-from-a-secure-connection">1. Make sure that your request is private and from a secure connection</h2>
<p>This API requires that you pass the entire database connection URI. This contains your username and password so never use this API directly from your frontend or from somewhere where users can access it.</p>
<p>If you use it on Zero.sh save your connection string on a <code>secret</code> and use that.</p>
<h2 id="2-format-your-request">2. Format your request</h2>
<p>This API accepts only <strong>POST</strong> requests to this endpoint: <code>https://labs.zero.sh/api/http2sql</code></p>
<p>The following data is allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>uri</strong>:
You database connection uri, e.g. <code>postgres:// ...</code>.</li>
<li><strong>query</strong>:
Your SQL query, e.g. <code>Select * from "Users"</code></li>
<li><strong>config_object</strong>:
If you don't want to pass the URI you can alternatively pass a <a href="https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sequelize connection object</a> - e.g. <code>{dialect: 'mysql', etc}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You always need to pass a <code>query</code> and either the <code>uri</code> or the <code>config_object</code></p>
<h2 id="3-your-response">3. Your response</h2>
<p>The tool will either return and error or, in case of success the sequelize response. (Note: This can be null, for example <code>INSERT INTO</code> statements)</p>
<h2 id="4-an-example">4. An example:</h2>
<p>This is how you would create a table of users on Zero:</p>
<div><pre><code>

<span>const</span> post_data <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>If you couldn’t tell by the title, this is a response to
<a href="https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277">this gist</a>, stating
that we should boycott Wayland because something something Red Hat evil and breakage
and…​global menus? Well, there were quite a few exaggerations and misrepresentations in
the gist, which will be shown and explained here.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>I’ll start off with this: many of the links are misquoted, some don’t even support the
points made with them, and some are highlighted supposed "broken" functionality with
either wrong dates or bugs that <em>have already been fixed</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, Wayland is different than Xorg. It was a complete re-imagining of how a modern and
less monolithic display protocol should look. Of course, breakage isn’t necessarily a
<em>good</em> thing…​but at the same time, some form of breakage is going to be inevitable. As
we’ll see soon, the breakage has mostly been confined to a few specific places (screen
capture most notably), where the current X way simply would not work with a more
secure protocol.</p>
<p>Now, I would be lying if I said this hasn’t taken a long time to develop, or that I
haven’t missed some of these features, but Linux apps and development are done by many
individual developers, whether volunteers or paid. As a result, a lot of work <em>does</em> take
a long time to complete. That being said, X’s current policy towards things like screen
capture and key binding is simply insecure, and it is inevitable that we will have to move
away from it eventually.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is it really worth throwing the entire protocol away for screen casting
(which works but needs more adoption) and…​global menus? I’ve been using Wayland on my
primary system for ages, and the flag workarounds for screen capture in Chromium (as
mentioned below) have been working fine for me. It’s not a perfect solution, but the
benefits Wayland provides have far exceeded the amount of time I’ve had to spend tweaking
the few things that weren’t working out of the box.</p>
<p>Some of Xorg’s core issues that required breakage to be solved in Wayland, such as it being
trivially easy to create keyloggers or view <em>any window without permissions</em> really are
things that you’d expect to see /r/linuxmasterrace mocking Windows over, not problems that
we should ignore on a supposedly secure system.</p>
<p>One more thing I’d like to add: <em>many of these links honestly make no sense as sources</em> or
were talking about entirely different things, with some discussion cherry-picked without
context. Without further ado…​</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>Screen recording has been available in Wayland for quite some time now, via
{link-pipewire} and {link-xdg-desktop-portal}. Now, the gist <em>does</em> make allusions to this:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Or force more Red Hat/Gnome components (glib, Portals, Pipewire) on everyone! [...]
There is a workaround for OBS Studio that requires a obs-xdg-portal plugin (which is known
to be Red Hat/Flatpak-centric, GNOME-centric, "perhaps" works with other desktops)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This is…​really, just completely wrong.</p>
<p>I have no idea why anything here would require clients to use GLib. All of the portal
APIs work over D-Bus, and Pipewire doesn’t even require GLib.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the
<a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/graphs/contributors">top contributors</a>,
we see contributions from employees of Collabora, Igalia, and Mozilla, not just Red Hat.</p>
<p>Pipewire also is not really a project that’s particularly tied to Red Hat; yes, the main
developer is from Red Hat, but he’s also a multimedia expert and one of the two creators
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer#Early_days">GStreamer</a> (a project founded while
the developer was still at Collabora). As of right now, Collabora is
<a href="https://www.collabora.com/about-us/open-source/open-source-projects/pipewire.html">a leading contributor to Pipewire as well</a>.
Even <a href="http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/podcast-ep-003-paul-davis-on-fixing-big-linux-audio-issues#main:~:text=PipeWire%20is%20an%20interesting%20project">
the creator of JACK is interested in Pipewire</a>, despite initially being skeptical.</p>
<p>A lot of the particular linked examples are just bizarre extrapolations:</p>

<p>This was targeting Linux screencasting <em>in general</em> as highlighted by the ffmpeg reference.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>

("I have now decided that there will be no Wayland support for the time being. Reason,
there is no budget for it. Let’s see how it looks in a year or two.") - This is the key
problem. Wayland breaks everything and then expects others to fix the wreckage it caused
on their own expense.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Looks like I missed the part where the Wayland developers had the ability to update every
single project in existence and add full Wayland support. Better yet, the issue would
indicate more lack of time by the developer to be able to push updates, not that Wayland
"breaks everything".</p>

<p>Okay, this one is just laughable. An OBS developer also stated in the same thread:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>For reference X11 solutions are very close to the worst possible interface one could design.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>which would imply that we can’t really stay with X screencasting either, thus ruining the
entire "just stick with X argument".</p>
<p>Better yet, <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/14">there’s already an RFC open for
Wayland support</a>. All the portals they mentioned as "incomplete" do already support the
screencast APIs anyway, so their knowledge at the time about it was likely already
outdated.</p>
<p>Now onto "screen sharing", which is the same API problem as "screen casting", but let’s
entertain the idea that it’s actually two separate points:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389">https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389</a> broken since 24 Jan 2016 ("Closing since
there is nothing we can do from the Jitsi Meet side.") See? Wayland breaks stuff and
leaves application developers helpless and unable to fix the breakage, even if they wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>First off…​this is two issues from the same repo. How does this count as two separate
breakages? I don’t even know where "2016" comes from, because the second issue was created
this year.</p>
<p>The quoted text was not in response to Wayland missing functionality; Pipewire already
existed at this point. Rather it was related to browsers implementing the screencast API.
This has been implemented in Chromium behind a flag for years at least, and it was only
behind a flag because parts of Chromium’s UI flow assumed there was no permissions model,
so it would ask the user to select a window to share after they already selected it in the
Wayland compositor. This is actively being worked on in both
<a href="https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src//189544[WebRTC]%20andhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src//1942327">Chromium itself</a>.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22">https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22</a> Zoom broken since at least 4 Jan 2019.
("Can not start share, we only support wayland on GNOME with Ubuntu (17, 18), Fedora (25
to 29), Debian 9, openSUSE Leap 15, Arch Linux"). No word about non-GNOME!</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>"Yes, let’s highlight a Linux client that is notoriously buggy and generally terrible."</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>Again, I don’t know why this is split into three sections. But first off:</p>

<p><strong>The issue had nothing to do with this, and this is a gross misquoting.</strong> The issue reads:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>This Gtk+4 fact, will be sad and will make Gtk+ unusable to the Gnome Global Menu
extension, as it’s implemented now. That’s why the Gnome Global Menu extension will be
discontinued again. The first reason was because the lack of the Gtk+ Wayland support for
the Global Menu, that was resolved here and now will be because Gtk+ will no longer
supports generic loadable modules.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In other words, this issue was showing something unrelated, and at the time, Wayland
support was already working. The date used in the gist ("broken since 24 Aug 2018") is
also incorrect, since it’s pointing to the date the linked issue was filed, at which point
Wayland support was again working.</p>
<p>GTK’s own lack of support for global menus over Wayland itself had little to do with
Wayland and more to do with GTK itself not wanting to support global menus, as the current
global menu implementation was very closely targeting Xorg.</p>
<p>Next up:</p>

<p>In other words…​if you actually read the article, they were able to make it work on
Wayland <strong>without</strong> the re-engineering. In fact, the whole point of the article was to
highlight that they were able to get it to work.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE had to do additional work to work around it. And it still did not work:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The linked bug literally says this was fixed in 5.20.</p>

<p><strong>This is literally the same link as above</strong>. Why is this a separate point?</p>

<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->



<p><strong>Once again, this has been fixed:</strong></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The best solution is for Qt including the QPA platform plugin and having a proper
auto-detection based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE. The situation will improve with Qt 5.11, but it
doesn’t really help as the Qt LTS versions will continue to face the problem.</p>
<p>For now we implemented a change in Plasma 5.13 so that we don’t need to set the env variable
any more. Plasma is able to select the appropriate platform plugin based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE
environment variable. Non-Plasma processes will use the default platform plugin. With Qt
&lt; 5.11 this is xcb, with Qt 5.11 this will most likely change to wayland. KDE’s flatpak
applications pick Wayland by default in a Wayland session and are unaffected by the change.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Really, I’d argue the actual problem is trying to bundle every individual dependency into
a single file and expecting the users to never have to add anything else? This is pretty
bizarre especially because it’s no different than having to include the global menu
platform plugin to make global menus work, which AppImages already need! In other words,
this is just an AppImage problem and its style clashing with the Qt reliance on various
forms of dynamically-loaded plugins.</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>The opening to the article says:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayland solves no issues I have</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>I’d like to make a quick jab at this statement: just because you don’t have issues doesn’t
imply that aren’t issues that others are stuck dealing with or fixing. Xorg’s APIs are
quite nasty, and developers have to deal with them. There are things that Wayland can
support easily but X cannot, and there are people who have to deal with those.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Is-Wayland-the-New-X">This article</a> covers
a few of the reasons X is a mess:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Stone traces the earliest origins of Wayland to a page on the X.Org wiki started by Adam Jackson called X12. “It wasn’t a serious attempt at a design,” Stone stresses, “but a list of things we would do differently if we had a chance to rework the core protocol.”</p>
<p>For many developers, this list helped codify the problems …</p></blockquote></div></div></div>

		 <h4>Surprising sound let down by serious comfort problems</h4>

		 
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=6b8a0daf46384709fee2520ad544cdff"></p>
<p>I’m conflicted about Apple’s latest foray into audio products, the AirPods Max over-ear headphones.</p>
<p>In striking opposition to every other review I’ve seen so far, I get to begin mine by stating that I <em>am</em> an audiophile. A friendly, reasonable one, but still—<a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/plague-inc-the-cure">audio is my jam</a>. I’ve been writing music for games and film for over 10 years, so one would hope that I’ve learned a thing or two about audio production in that time. It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.</p>

<p>Apple has had a long and fruitful relationship with music, but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products. Beats are a common entry point into the world of audio, but they’re priced the way they are because of their brand power, not because their quality justifies it. You can get much better sound, comfort, features, and build for less money.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself wondering to what extent that is also true for the AirPods Max.</p>
<p>Having forked over just under $900 <span>CAD</span> for the privilege of owning a pair, I wanted to see whether Apple is aiming to establish itself as a purveyor of quality audio gear—deserving of a high price tag—or whether we’ll once again be paying for style over substance.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-5.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=3b6c49e79651f9f936486a7886ff54db"></p>

<p>I laughed when I pulled the AirPods Max out of their box. I knew they would be heavy, but the experience of that weight is really something else.</p>
<p>For context, the Sennheiser <span>PXC</span> 550—my current headphone choice for travel—weigh 227g. The famously comfortable Bose 700 weigh 254g, a weight that’s matched by the popular Sony WH-1000XM4. Premium pairs like the Bang &amp; Olufsen <span>H9</span> (third generation) weigh 295g, and the Bowers &amp; Wilkins <span>PX7</span> just barely crest the 300g mark.</p>
<p>The AirPods Max weigh <em>385g</em>.</p>
<p>In the same way that the iPhone 12’s aluminum build <em>looks</em> less fancy but <em>feels</em> nicer in use than its Pro counterparts and their stainless steel, the mostly-metal build of the AirPods Max is a choice that favours fashion over comfort.</p>
<p>The reason that other high-end headphone manufacturers lean heavily on plastic and even wood in their builds isn’t that they can’t afford metal. It’s because they’re interested in having human beings wear these products on their heads for hours at a time.</p>
<p>As one such human being with a head, I wish Apple had taken some cues from the competition on this front. Even after adjusting the way I wear them, I can’t escape the fact that these are just plain <em>uncomfortable</em> for long listening sessions. The mesh headband and foam ear cups do their best to mitigate this, but they can’t compensate for the sheer weight.</p>
<p>The headband is terrific. It may be my favourite approach to one that I’ve seen on a headphone. I have to wear the band further back on my head than I do with other headphones, but once I figured that out I was able to wear them for longer before needing a break. The ear cups are less impressive. They’re spacious and fairly well padded, but the material that’s used feels somewhat cheap and scratchy in texture. I suspect it’s more breathable than typical leather or vinyl ear cups, but the physical impression isn’t as good and I don’t particularly like how they feel on my face.</p>
<p>Then there’s the clamping force, which is <em>very</em> strong; AirPods Max squeeze your head like a musical bear hug. This is a common problem with heavy headphones, so I wasn’t surprised to see it here, but it accounts for the majority of the comfort problems I have.</p>
<p>The pressure points will differ depending on your fit, but I offered these to two other people in my vicinity for some extended listening and both reported discomfort; one on the top of their head, the other around their ears where the clamp force put pressure on the jaw. Personally, I experience it mainly as a headache after about the half hour to one hour mark.</p>
<p>Let’s disregard weight for a moment, though. These are fine for shorter listening sessions and everyone’s head is different, so I’m sure there are folks out there who will find them to be perfectly comfortable. The problems with metal go beyond weight: by prioritizing fashion value over practical value, Apple has committed a series of unforced errors.</p>
<p>Anodized aluminum feels nice and soft, but that softness means they scuff easily…like, say, when you fold them flat and notice that the ear cups bump and scratch against each other. This happens all the time and it makes me cringe every time; it’s like the horrible scraping that iMac users will be familiar with from trying to plug something into the rear ports. Also, parts of the world experience a season called winter, where the temperature drops and metal surfaces become dangerous things your skin will stick to.</p>
<p>Now, about that<span></span> <span>“</span>protective case”.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-8.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=392ed93e8e6a65298b215cf68f228603"></p>
<p>I want to save myself some typing and point you to <a href="https://youtu.be/Gvvo6vUpJRc?t=639" target="_blank">the part of <span>MKBHD</span><span></span><span>’</span>s review video</a> where he talks about the storage solution that these $900 headphones ship with. Go ahead and give that a watch. Back? Great. What he said. Before getting these, I thought the hate for the case was hyperbolic, but the truth is it really <em>does</em> feel cheap and pointless, particularly after <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886" target="_blank">Apple clarified</a> that it isn’t necessary for putting the headphones into standby mode.</p>
<p>Before we leave the topic of their physical design, I want to share one last complaint about the AirPods Max: the buttons. I don’t mind the feel of them myself (though a friend felt they were cheap and unpleasant), but I <em>do</em> mind the way they work. The Digital Crown, which controls volume, is also the button that controls playback and Siri. The other, larger button is used to switch between the listening modes: Active Noise Cancellation (<span>ANC</span>), Transparency mode, and none.</p>
<p>I appreciate having physical controls for these things, but I intuitively expected that all the audio-related functions would be accessed from one button and that the playback and feature controls would be accessed from the other. Tying playback controls to the volume knob feels strange to me, and increases the chances of unintentional volume changes when you’re trying to execute a double or triple press—something made even trickier if you’re wearing gloves.</p>
<p>There is, naturally, no way to configure these button assignments. At best, you’re able to change the scrolling direction of the volume knob and restrict which listening modes the other button switches between, but that’s about it. That latter feature also seems to be buggy in the current firmware (<span>3C16</span>) because despite enabling all three, I find that it defaults back to just Noise Cancellation or Transparency whenever I reconnect.</p>
<p>Deal-breaker? No.&nbsp;But another strange design choice to wrap up this section.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-7.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=f6b19d4c7ef961a06df1a759fc2f45b5"></p>
<p>Wait, one more complaint: the battery life is the shortest of any headphone in this category. This isn’t an issue in and of itself considering they’ll still last through a full day of listening. Still, I hoped that some of that excess size and weight would translate into battery capacity.</p>
<p>On the topic of power, Apple has indicated that the AirPods Max have two low-power states and you <em>don’t</em> need the case to access them—great news since I refuse to use that stupid thing. Here’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886" target="_blank">what they say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you set your AirPods Max down and leave them stationary for 5 minutes, they go into a low power mode to preserve battery charge. After 72 stationary hours out of the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into a lower power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My to preserve battery charge further. If you put your AirPods Max in the Smart Case when you’re not using them, they go into a low power mode immediately to preserve battery charge. After 18 hours in the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into an ultralow power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My and maximizes battery life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, <em>now</em> I’m done talking about the physical characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="sonic-boom">Sonic Boom</h2>
<p>So there I was, shaking my head at the weight and the design while I got them connected. I was already looking up Apple’s holiday return policy when I hit play on my usual suite of test material and…oh.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-4.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=a34de6bb9c7c71b5c5ccbfad05e1c8f6"></p>
<p>I was reminded of <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-bowers-wilkins-p7-wireless-headphones-review/" target="_blank">the first time</a> a pair of wireless headphones impressed me. I put them on and somehow found myself lying on the floor of my room, two hours later, having become completely lost in the music. Since then, <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/bang-olufsen-h9i">other headphones</a> have achieved this magical time-dilation effect, but I didn’t expect to feel it coming from an Apple product.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, Apple has amazing audio engineers. <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-pro">I adore my AirPods Pro</a>. They’re not the best value for money in terms of sound, but they have a pleasant, relatively neutral profile and have become my daily listening companions. Similarly, the HomePod is my favourite smart speaker for sound because it manages to provide a remarkably full and dynamic listening experience for a compact mono sound source.</p>
<p>In a word, the AirPods Max sound <em>sublime</em>.</p>
<p>They have a beautiful way of making you feel immersed and enveloped by the music, with a tremendously wide soundstage, solid instrument placement, and some of the most articulate dynamics I’ve heard from consumer equipment. They remind me of my open-back studio headphone and amp setup (the geeky audiophile equipment) more than other wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Several hours of listening later, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just experiencing some sort of hallucination caused by the extreme clamping force of these metallic behemoths, so I called up my friend and had him bring over his pair of Bang &amp; Olufsen H9i—<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/articles/a-roundup-of-the-best-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-headphones/" target="_blank">my previous benchmark</a> for best wireless <span>ANC</span> headphones—to do some critical listening.</p>
<p>We cruised through our respective music libraries, selecting favourite tracks and listening, each of us with one of the pairs on. Then we’d swap <a href="https://atp.fm/409" target="_blank">(as others have pointed …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

                      <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
                      We combine the efficiancy of convolutional approaches with
                      the expressivity of transformers by introducing a
                      convolutional <em>VQGAN</em>, which learns a codebook of
                      context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled
                      with an autoregressive transformer.

  Designed to learn long-range interactions on sequential data, transformers
  continue to show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks.  In
  contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local
  interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible
  for long sequences, such as high-resolution images.  We demonstrate how
  combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the
  expressivity of transformers enables
  them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images.
  We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of
  image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently
  model their composition within high-resolution images.
  Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both
  non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information,
  such as segmentations, can
  control the generated image.
  In particular, we present the first results on semantically-guided synthesis
  of megapixel images with transformers.

Figure 2. Our approach uses a convolutional VQGAN to learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is subsequently modeled with an autoregressive transformer architecture. A discrete codebook provides the interface between these architectures and a patch-based discriminator enables strong compression while retaining high perceptual quality. This method introduces the efficiency of convolutional approaches to transformer based high resolution image synthesis.

  Given the ever-increasing computational costs of modern machine learning models, we need to find new ways to reuse such expert models and thus tap into the resources that have been invested in their creation. Recent work suggests that the power of these massive models is captured by the representations they learn. Therefore, we seek a model that can relate between different existing representations and propose to solve this task with a conditionally invertible network. This network demonstrates its capability by (i) providing generic transfer between diverse domains, (ii) enabling controlled content synthesis by allowing modification in other domains, and (iii) facilitating diagnosis of existing representations by translating them into interpretable domains such as images. Our domain transfer network can translate between fixed representations without having to learn or finetune them. This allows users to utilize various existing domain-specific expert models from the literature that had been trained with extensive computational resources. Experiments on diverse conditional image synthesis tasks, competitive image modification results and experiments on …</p></div></div></section></div>

    <p>Writeup by: <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderkrog">Zanderdk</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On the 2021-01-26 qualy released this <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt">article</a> describing a “new” (actually 10 year old) bug in sudo that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation though a heap buffer overflow.
Unfortunately they did not release exploit/POC so I decided to build one myself and failed. It turned out that Pewz from the CTF team bootplug had the same thought and our combined forces allowed us to successfully exploit this bug on the newest libc 2.32 in an arch environment with sudo version 1.9.4p2.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
<p>I will only briefly cover the vulnerability here as it’s quite well described in the article.</p>
<p>In an essence an attacker can overflow a heap chunk by inserting a single backslash at the end of any argv or env argument given to sudo, causing the following argument to be written out of bound. Let’s look at a simplified version of one of the code snippets from the article.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> (size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; <span>*</span>av; av<span>++</span>)
  size <span>+=</span> strlen(<span>*</span>av) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;
...
<span>if</span> (size <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> (user_args <span>=</span> malloc(size)) <span>==</span> NULL) {
  <span>//do some stuff we don't care about
</span><span></span>}
...
<span>for</span> (to <span>=</span> user_args, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; (from <span>=</span> <span>*</span>av); av<span>++</span>) {
  <span>while</span> (<span>*</span>from) {
    <span>if</span> (from[<span>0</span>] <span>==</span> <span>'\\'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>isspace((<span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span>)from[<span>1</span>]))
      from<span>++</span>;
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span>from<span>++</span>;
    }
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>' '</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>As we see in the first for loop we are iterating over each argument and finding the size (plus null terminator) of it using <code>strlen</code>. Now lets say we have the string <code>"AAAA\\"</code> (<code>\\</code> is one char).</p>
<p>The size will be 5 and it will only do an allocation of 5 bytes assuming this is the only argument.</p>
<p>In the next part we have a outer for loop over arguments and an inner loop copying the contents of all the arguments into the single buffer, <code>user_args</code>, essentially concatenating all arguments.</p>
<p>Considering the same string as before, <code>"AAAA\\"</code>, when we hit <code>from[0]=='\\'</code> we go into the if and increment <code>from</code> by <code>from++</code>, incrementing <code>from</code> so it points to the null terminator. After that we continue the loop with the next statement <code>*to++ = *from++;</code> copying the null terminator and again incrementing <code>from</code> to continue copying bytes after the null terminator we continue copying out of bounds.</p>
<p>This happens because it expects that every <code>\\</code> is followed by a meta-character, which the authors came up with a clever way of avoiding, leaving this vulnerable to a overflow. Read the article if you want to know why and how we can end up having a single <code>\\</code> in the args when entering this block.</p>
<p>By using the symbolic link <code>sudoedit</code> to <code>sudo</code> we can make this happen:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kalmarunionen.dk/images/overflow.png" alt="sudo exploit overflowing"></p>
<h3 id="properties-of-the-overflow">Properties of the overflow</h3>
<p>The authors state 3 important properties about this overflow which make it quite powerful.</p>
<p>First and simplest we control the allocation size of <code>user_args</code> as we chose how many and how long we make the arguments to sudo.</p>
<p>Second we control the contents of the overflowed area.
This we can achieve by using the supplied environment variables. The environment variables is infact stored right after the last argument passed to <code>sudoedit</code> meaning that if we do <code>env -i 'A=BBBB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC'</code> we insert the C’s into the user_args buffer and <code>A=BBBB</code> will follow in the out of bounds area. Be aware that chunk size’s align to sizes of 0x10 so e.g. <code>env -i 'A=BB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCBBBBBBBB'</code> will only fill the buffer.</p>
<p>If you paid close attention to the inner loop in our concatenation block you probably noticed that we can exploit this multiple times. By ending a environment variable with <code>\\</code> we can make another skip to the next environment variable. So why would we like that? Because as the <code>from++</code> increments the pointer to the null terminator on the following <code>to++ = *from++;</code> it will insert that null terminator. This makes us able to insert 0x0 as well without ending the overflow making this overflow extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Example from the authors:</p>
<p><code>env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'</code></p>
<p>This will end up like this in the buffer:</p>
<pre><code>--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
              size  &lt;---- user_args buffer ----&gt;  size      fd       bk
</code></pre><p>So we wont go into what forward (fd) or backwards (bk) pointers of a heap chunk mean as we are only exploiting in use memory.
Super short and oversimplified description:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first size is the size of the following chunk. It is equal to 0x10 + argument given to malloc as we also need space for size itself and alignment/previous size.</li>
<li>the next size is the contiguous chunks size.</li>
<li>fd and bk are pointers to the next and previous chunk respectively in this linked list of freed chunks. This only applies to freed chunks. Otherwise this space is available to the caller of malloc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know more about this topic I strongly encourage you to read the <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/">Azeria’s blog about heap exploitation</a>.</p>
<p>Now an important note to make here about the null terminator insertion I think the original paper lacks is that we can insert multiple contiguous null bytes as well.</p>
<p>First thing to understand is that environment variables don’t have to in the form of <code>SOMETHING=something_more</code>. As everything else these are just char arrays and we can do what we can with them in C. as example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>char</span> <span>*</span>args[] <span>=</span> { <span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, <span>"-s"</span>, <span>"AAAAAAAA"</span>, NULL };
<span>char</span> <span>*</span>env[] <span>=</span> { <span>"BBBBBBBB"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"CCCCCCCC"</span>, NULL };
execve(<span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, argv, env);
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using execve to execute the process with full control of the environment variables.
In the inner for loop we run into the if statement at ´"\\“´ and by that skipping one char by <code>from++</code> the backslash and only inserting the null jumping onto the next ´”\\“´ and consequently inserting two null bytes in a row.</p>
<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>
<p>While the authors mention 3 possible targets here in this writeup we will only cover the second one.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>no brute-force involved in contrast to the first option where they partially overflow a function pointer defeating ASLR with brute-force.</li>
<li>They state that they did it successfully for 3 operating systems where both the other two were only one.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second option we try to overflow into a <code>service_user</code> struct stored on the heap.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> service_user
{
  <span>/* And the link to the next entry.  */</span>
  <span>struct</span> service_user <span>*</span>next;
  <span>/* Action according to result.  */</span>
  lookup_actions actions[<span>5</span>];
  <span>/* Link to the underlying library object.  */</span>
  service_library <span>*</span>library;
  <span>/* Collection of known functions.  */</span>
  <span>void</span> <span>*</span>known;
  <span>/* Name of the service (`files', `dns', `nis', ...).  */</span>
  <span>char</span> name[<span>0</span>];
} service_user;
</code></pre></div><p>This struct is used in the <code>nss_load_library</code> of libc quite often after the overflow happens for loading new dynamically linked libraries, and can we overflow the name filed then we control what library to load.
Then we can target some non privileged library we can craft that will run with the privileges of root. :-)</p>
<p>The function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>static</span> <span>int</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>The goal with this function is to hit the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle = __libc_dlopen(shlib_name)</code> loading a new library we control.</p>
<p>Here there are two things to be aware of the first the one mentioned in the article.
If <code>ni-&gt;library</code> is not <code>NULL</code> we will use that pointer in the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle</code> and as ASLR is a bitch we can’t predict a valid pointer without a leak which we don’t have.
Fortunately there is a initial case for this struct where if this is null we set it by <code>ni-&gt;library = nss_new_service (...</code>. Now the multiple null byte write comes in handy!</p>
<p>Then we just need to overflow this struct all the way to it’s name field to change it to an unprivileged library we control.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that we have this next pointer <code>struct service_user *next;</code> inside the struct forming a linked list that will be traversed when the loading happens.
So if we accidentally overflow another <code>service_user</code> struct in the process we will write a garbage pointer if we overflow with fx A’s leading to a seg fault.
This can be circumvented by inserting null bytes in that spot but that creates another problem, we now break the linked list and our target struct could now be completely removed from the list leaving no pointers to it in the entire memory space.</p>
<p>This means that we have to target the first struct in the linked list that comes after our allocated area.
This turned out to be the biggest challenge to overcome as you can imagine this requires pretty good control of the heap allocation.</p>
<p>In the article they target a <code>service_user</code> with the name <code>systemd</code> which we by no means were able to target.
So we set a breakpoint just before the allocation to inspect the linked list. Then we search for <code>systemd</code> and traverse the list backwards until we find the first <code>service_user</code> close to our allocation. (Combined with some trial and error overflowing of A’s to see what struct it crashes on :-))</p>
<p>Here I show the different <code>service_user</code> names in memory and below vmmaps listed in same order. As seen on the picture the second vmmap corresponds to a systemd in the …</p></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86">virt86</a> for a few weeks now, and some of the things I decided to focus on were type safety and making good use of modern C++ features. I did many things to reduce the chances for users to shoot their own foot with the library, such as <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/d050883ee3931e6a0a74d3da9f6b948ee3cd0533/modules/core/include/virt86/platform/platform.hpp#L77">deleting move and copy constructors and assignment operators</a> from classes to make sure there is only one instance obtained from a known source, <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/d050883ee3931e6a0a74d3da9f6b948ee3cd0533/modules/core/include/virt86/vp/vp.hpp#L108">deleting</a> or <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/d050883ee3931e6a0a74d3da9f6b948ee3cd0533/modules/core/include/virt86/vm/vm.hpp#L326">hiding</a> the address operator <code>&amp;</code> so that users cannot get a pointer to objects that are not meant to be <code>delete</code>d and using <code>enum class</code> for type-safe enumerations.</p>

<p>I figured it would be interesting to use <code>enum class</code>es as bitmasks for their type-safety. Unfortunately, you cannot use them as is with bitwise operators, but you can use other C++ features to make them behave like a bitmask type.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="a-basic-version">A basic version</h2>

<p>I knew very little about <code>enum class</code>es at the time, so my first idea was to add methods to the type, assuming they would work like a <code>class</code>, however C++ disallows that. The next solution I thought of was to define operator overloads outside them, which I found out to be allowed by the language. Templates would make that even better.</p>

<p>While researching a bit about using <code>enum class</code> as bitmasks I came across a <a href="http://blog.bitwigglers.org/using-enum-classes-as-type-safe-bitmasks/">blog post</a> by Andre Haupt, which the author says is “a reiteration of a <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/cplusplus/using-enum-classes-as-bitfields.html">blog post</a> by Anthony Williams”, which is exactly the kind of solution I envisioned. The post progressively expands from a motivating example based on <code>unsigned</code> values and regular <code>enums</code>, to a simple set of overloaded operators for an specific type of enumeration, to templates which encompass every <code>enum class</code> type, finishing with SFINAE to ensure only types tagged as bitmasks actually have access to the bitwise operators.</p>

<p>I took his code and modernized it a bit by introducing an alias template for the bitmask enum type trait value and using the alias template <code>std::underlying_type_t</code>, both of which saves a bit of typing overall. Here’s my version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define ENABLE_BITMASK_OPERATORS(x)  \

};

<span>}</span>

<span>// ... similarly for &amp;= and ^=
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how the author demonstrated its usage, which is unchanged with my version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Permissions</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Readable</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x4</span><span>,</span> <span>Writable</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x2</span><span>,</span> <span>Executable</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>Permissions</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>  
<span>p</span> <span>|=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>;</span>  
<span>p</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>~</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>The original version falls short when it comes to another common use case for bitmasks: checking if a bitmask contains a particular bit. You have to do some convoluted and repetitive code to achieve that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>p</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has Executable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And what if we need to check if the bitmask contains at least one bit of a set of multiple bits?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Permissions</span> <span>rw</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>p</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>rw</span><span>)</span> <span>...</span> <span>??</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One way to solve this problem is to add a <code>None = 0</code> entry to the enum. Or you could resort to <code>static_cast</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Permissions</span> <span>rw</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>p</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>rw</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Permissions</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is still too cumbersome. Wouldn’t it be great if you could write those conditions like this?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>AllOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has Executable
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>AnyOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could even introduce new checks, such as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>NoneOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Writable, but may have other bits
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>AnyExcept</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Executable and has at least one of the other bits
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, we hit the same wall again: <code>enum class</code>es cannot have methods.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-struct">Enter the struct</h2>

<p>The solution I came up with is to introduce a <code>struct</code> template which wraps an <code>enum class</code> and provides the check methods.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>BitmaskEnum</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>Enum</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>Enum</span> <span>none</span> <span>=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>underlying</span> <span>=</span> <span>typename</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>underlying_type_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

    <span>BitmaskEnum</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>is_bitmask_enum_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... operations here
</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The basic checks we want to implement are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Any()</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains any bits</li>
  <li><code>None()</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask is empty</li>
  <li><code>AnyOf(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains one or more bits from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>AllOf(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains all bits from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>NoneOf(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask doesn’t contain any bit from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>AnyExcept(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains any bits excluding those from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>NoneExcept(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask doesn’t contain any bits excluding those from the given bitmask</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be very handy to have an <code>EnumBitmask</code> to convert back into the <code>Enum</code> value or a <code>bool</code>, the latter of which is a very common use case with regular <code>enum</code>s or even <code>int</code>s to check if the bitmask has any bits set.</p>

<p>The implementations of these operations are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Here’s how to use the <code>BitmaskEnum</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Permissions</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>pBM</span> <span>=</span> <span>BitmaskEnum</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>AllOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has Executable
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>AnyOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>NoneOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Writable, but may have other bits
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>AnyExcept</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Executable and has at least one of the other bits
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much nicer and easier to understand. The best part of it? It’s a <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/ETAPS-corrected-draft.pdf">zero overhead abstraction</a>. No runtime costs at all. Here’s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/StrikerX3/46b9058d6c61387b3f361ef9d7e00cd4">gist</a> containing a header file taken straight out of <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/master/modules/core/include/virt86/util/bitmask_enum.hpp">virt86</a>, along with a cpp file you can use in <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> to check that this is indeed free. (Except MSVC, which still compiles every method in the struct, even though none of them are used, but the <code>test()</code> function is essentially the same.)</p>

<strong>Optimized down to a simple return!</strong></p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that it is illegal to specialize a template in a different namespace. This will happen if you define an <code>enum class</code> in a namespace and immediately use the macro still within the namespace:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>ENABLE_BITMASK_OPERATORS</span><span>(</span><span>Bar</span><span>)</span>
<span>// error: specialization of ‘template&lt;class Enum&gt; struct is_bitmask_enum’ in different namespace [-fpermissive]
</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One solution to this is to use the macro after the namespace block, referring to the <code>enum class</code> via its namespace:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>ENABLE_BITMASK_OPERATORS</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>::</span><span>Bar</span><span>)</span>
<span>// good to go
</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope this helps you use the type-safe <code>enum class</code> as bitmasks more comfortably!</p>

    <p>I was looking for some books for these months taking into consideration that I should improve my architecture and design skills. So <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/emergent-design/">I recently read Emergent Design</a> and now <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">Refactoring for Software Design Smells</a>. I don’t remember where I saw it recommended, but when I started to browse the book (I use O’Reilly), I saw it was recommended by the ACM fellow, Grady Booch. The person who authored <a href="https://amzn.to/2MBmvNU">Object-Oriented Analysis and Design With Applications</a> and who said that code should read like well-written prose. It seemed to be a good recommendation.</p>

<p>Was it worth to read the book? Let’s find it out together.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-is-technical-debt">What is technical debt?</h2>

<p>In the part of the book, the authors discuss what is technical debt, what kinds of technical debts are out there and what are their root causes.</p>

<h3 id="the-well-known-metaphor">The well-known metaphor</h3>

<p>The authors use the well-known metaphor, originally introduced by Ward Cunningham, the one that compares technical debt to financial debt.</p>

<p>You might invest in something that you don’t have money for at a given point in time, by taking on some loans. That’s possible and sometimes even desirable. But if you do so, you have to soon start paying back your debts, you have to pay the interests. If you don’t do that, if you postpone paying back your dues, the amount of interest will rise. They will keep rising until a point where they become unbearable and you have to declare bankruptcy and lose your home, your investment, etc.</p>

<p>Technical debt is like that. You can introduce some sloppy solutions to hit the market faster, to get faster feedback, but that doesn’t come for free.</p>

<p>You either pay back your technical debt, by cleaning up your code, by refactoring it, or the inevitable changes will be more difficult to implement. They can become so difficult that you simply wouldn’t even date to touch the code.</p>

<h3 id="four-kinds-of-technical-debt">Four kinds of technical debt</h3>

<p>The authors differentiate among 4 different categories of technical debt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>code debt</li>
  <li>design debt</li>
  <li>test debt</li>
  <li>documentation debt</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that test documentation debt are self-explaining categories. You either don’t write tests or documentation and therefore your level of trust in the code, your level of confidence to change it will decrease (test code), or it will be simply difficult to get relevant information about the code, about the features as you lack documentation.</p>

<p>The line between code and design bet can be thin, but in general code debt, code smells refer to much lower-level problems such as how you write a loop, how your functions are structured within a class, while design debt is more about how classes and even modules interact with each other.</p>

<p>The book focuses on the design debt, the design smells and how to remove them from a technical point of view.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-have-technical-debt">Why do we have technical debt?</h3>

<p>There are different reasons why technical debt is introduced. And just like for financial debt, there can be good and wrong reasons.</p>

<p>One cause is <strong>schedule pressure</strong>. If it’s constant and happens all the time, then it’s obviously bad and most probably you won’t take the time to fix the introduced smells. But from time to time, it can be crucial to get out to the market as fast as possible, and you can win big with it.</p>

<p>The other three reasons identified by the authors can hardly be categorized as good reasons. It’s simply bad people or bad technical management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lack of good/skilled designers</li>
  <li>lack of application design principles</li>
  <li>lack of awareness of design smells and refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Management either doesn’t hire the right people for the job / the composition of the team is not a good match for the problems to tackle.</p>

<p>This book teaches about the principles of good design and makes the readers aware of the relevant design smalls and the available refactoring techniques. Though if you need more details on the refactoring techniques, you’ll have to follow up with other sources.</p>

<h2 id="design-smells">Design smells</h2>

<p>Before jumping into the details of the many different design smells, the authors lay down the foundations by stating what they mean by design smells and what characteristics they have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Design smells are certain structures in the design that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="affected-attributes-of-a-software">Affected attributes of a software</h3>

<p>Design smells can hurt software in many different ways. In the <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">book</a>, there are seven quality attributes listed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understandability: how easy it is to understand the design of an application?</li>
  <li>Changeability: how easy it is to change the functionality of an application, or will it just break at unexpected places?</li>
  <li>Extensibility: in case of the need for new functionality arises, will it be easy to implement or…?</li>
  <li>Reusability: can you reuse some parts of the software at other places?</li>
  <li>Testability: is the design welcoming for tests or will it be a difficult challenge resulting that people will eventually stop testing?</li>
  <li>Reliability: with the design in place is easy to implement the requirements correctly? Will it help to avoid runtime issues?</li>
</ul>

<p>Later in the book, for each design smell, it’s studies which quality attributes they affect.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-main-design-principles">What are the main design principles?</h3>

<p>The authors enumerate 4 design principles and they use those to categorize the smells too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstraction: eliminate the details and generalize</li>
  <li>Encapsulation: hide the details</li>
  <li>Modularization:  Abstractions should be cohesive and loosely coupled</li>
  <li>Hierarchy: organize abstractions in clear hierarchical structures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-are-the-principles-violated">Why are the principles violated?</h3>

<p>Sometimes, <em>we simply don’t know about them</em> so we cannot take them into consideration. Other times, <em>we misunderstand them</em>. We try to create something according to a pattern we read about, but we lack the experience and we implement it in an incorrect way.</p>

<p>Often it happens that <em>we don’t think in an object-oriented way</em> and we come up with implementations that are procedural. It might be because we worked in a language where that was enforced and <em>there were strong language limitations</em> preventing the devs from using modern designs.</p>

<p>Or we simply don’t care for any reason…</p>

<h2 id="so-many-design-smells">So many design smells</h2>

<p>In the biggest part of the book, you will find 25 design smells discussed in details. The scope of this book review obviously doesn’t let me introduce you all of them, so I picked 3 design smells that I want to mention.</p>

<h3 id="imperative-abstraction">Imperative Abstraction</h3>

<p>I choose this one because that’s something I regularly do myself. I turn operations into classes.</p>

<p>You can recognize this smell when there is only one - public - method defined within the class. Even worse, the class name and the method name might be the same. In C++, sometimes I just override the <code>operator()</code> to get rid of this problem.</p>

<p>As a solution, the authors suggest to move such an operation to the abstraction that uses it, often there is only one user of this class/method.</p>

<p>By that, the design becomes cleaner and less complex.</p>

<p>When I offend this role, it’s often because I have to fix some legacy code and I have no time, to do major a refactoring, but I want to extract some behaviour, in fact, an operation, so that I can easily test it.</p>

<p>I understand it would be better to extract the data along with the behaviour so that they constitute a cohesive entity, even though it takes more effort to refactor that way.</p>

<h3 id="multifaceted-abstraction">Multifaceted Abstraction</h3>

<p>This is something that happens a lot. We see it everywhere and we also contribute with our fair share to worsen the situation.</p>

<p>A multifaceted abstraction has a too wide API, it has too many responsibilities. In fact, it’s an offence against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.</p>

<p>The authors bring many examples, even from the core of Java SDK libraries.</p>

<p>The solution is quite straightforward, but of course, not so easy to carry out all the time: extract classes, divide them into smaller, cohesive abstractions.</p>

<h3 id="deficient-encapsulation">Deficient Encapsulation</h3>

<p>Do you automatically create a pair of getters and setters for the members of a class? Some IDEs will even help you do that.</p>

<p>With that, you’ll leak many implementation details. Details that the clients of the class should not depend on.</p>

<p>The problem is that it’s quite difficult to change the situation. You might also know this as <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s law</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a sufficient number of users of an API,
it does not matter what you promise in the contract:
all observable behaviours of your system
will be depended on by somebody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often, it’s compelling to make internal methods publicly accessible for the sake of testability, but if you have to do that, it only means that your design is bad.</p>

<p>You have to take into consideration the effects. Often, if you work in an internal codebase, it will be an acceptable compromise. You expose a method, you make it testable and you know that the external world will have no access to it. But if you’d it a library used by many, you should really look for another solution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">Refactoring for Software Design Smells</a> the authors explain what 4 design principles should we use to achieve a high-quality design and what are the main reasons behind failure to achieve it.</p>

<p>Then they analyze 25 design smells categorized by the 4 design principles. For each we read about how they appear, what quality attributes they hurt and what can we do about them.</p>

<p>If you are looking for levelling up your software design knowledge, I think this book is worth to read. You’ll realize how many smells you also introduce to your code with the best intention and you’ll also get some recipes on how to avoid them.</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>

<p>UUID also known as GUID is an alternative primary key type for SQL databases. It offers some non-obvious advantages compared to standard integer-based keys. Phoenix provides reliable support for working with UUID using its Ecto PostgreSQL adapter. In this tutorial, we will dive deep into UUIDs with all their cons and pros.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-uuids-instead-of-integers">Benefits of using UUIDs instead of integers</h2>
<p>UUID is a random string in a predefined format. Sample value looks like that:</p>
<p><code>ccbb63c0-a8cd-47b7-8445-5d85e9c80977</code></p>
<p>UUID is superior to integer-based primary keys in many ways. One caveat might be the size of database indexes, but for non-big-data tables, you shouldn’t notice the difference between integers and UUIDs.</p>


<h3 id="exposing-non-public-information-in-urls">Exposing non-public information in URLs</h3>
<p>A primary key value is usually publicly discoverable in URLs and API network logs. In turn, everyone can roughly estimate the app’s resources, total number, and pace of growth. Do you really want to expose how many users are signing up to your service or how many products you are selling with public URLs like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>/orders/2234/checkout
/users/287/profile
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This issue could be mitigated by adding slugs, but these are just duplicated unique keys with additional maintenance required.</p>
<p>Switching to UUID results in URLs that don’t expose any potentially confidential information:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>/orders/cc7a4c8b-1a90-4287-a983-3f6e10bd88d4/checkout
/users/6b6cabb3-e37d-4dd1-ae18-a4eb893b07ae/profile
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="access-scoping-bugs">Access scoping bugs</h3>
<p>Properly scoping access to resources in web apps with non-trivial business logic is hard. It’s possible to ship code like:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>InvoiceController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"</span><span>id"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>id</span><span>})</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>invoice</span> <span>=</span> <span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>Invoice</span><span>,</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>

    <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>show.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>invoice:</span> <span>invoice</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>instead of:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>InvoiceController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"</span><span>id"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>id</span><span>},</span> <span>current_user</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>invoice</span> <span>=</span> <span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>one</span><span>(</span>
                <span>from</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>Invoice</span><span>,</span>
                <span>where:</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>==</span> <span>^</span><span>id</span> <span>and</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>==</span> <span>^</span><span>current_user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
              <span>)</span>

    <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>show.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>invoice:</span> <span>invoice</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This example might seem obvious, but in apps with multiple user roles and complex logic for who can access what, it’s not always possible to completely prevent similar mistakes.</p>
<p>If invoice ID was a UUID type in the above example, it would make it impossible for an attacker to sequentially scan integer ID values looking for a security hole. This simple change makes a range of potential security bugs extremely unlikely to exploit.</p>
<p>By no means, I claim that using UUID releases you from the necessity to scope access to resources in your web app. Still, it might save you in case a similar security loophole was discovered in your project.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-independence">Frontend “independence”</h3>
<p>UUID primary keys allow frontend applications to independently generate new objects, together with IDs, without talking to the backend. A unique ID can be created using the JavaScript code, and the chances of collision with already existing objects are negligible.</p>
<p>This approach opens up a whole array of possibilities for frontend developers, e.g., to batch create objects together with their associations without the overhead of API calls.</p>
<h2 id="uuid-formats-in-elixir-ecto">UUID formats in Elixir Ecto</h2>
<p>You can generate UUID with Elixir by running:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>()</span>
<span># "b436517a-e294-4211-8312-8576933f2db1"</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Under the hood string format of UUID is converted to binary when interacting with the database layer. To generate a sample binary UUID run:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>bingenerate</span><span>()</span>
<span># &lt;&lt;72, 143, 56, 198, 127, 12, 78, 152, 141, 149, 101, 55, 70, 15, 236, 224&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>You can convert one format to another in the following way:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>b436517a-e294-4211-8312-8576933f2db1"</span><span>)</span>

<span># {:ok, &lt;&lt;180, 54, 81, 122, 226, 148, 66, 17, 131, 18, 133, 118, 147, 63, 45, 177&gt;&gt;}</span>

<span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>180</span><span>,</span> <span>54</span><span>,</span> <span>81</span><span>,</span> <span>122</span><span>,</span> <span>226</span><span>,</span> <span>148</span><span>,</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>17</span><span>,</span> <span>131</span><span>,</span> <span>18</span><span>,</span> <span>133</span><span>,</span> <span>118</span><span>,</span> <span>147</span><span>,</span> <span>63</span><span>,</span> <span>45</span><span>,</span> <span>177</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>)</span>

<span># {:ok, "b436517a-e294-4211-8312-8576933f2db1"}</span></code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="how-to-start-using-uuid-in-elixir-phoenix-apps">How to start using UUID in Elixir Phoenix apps</h2>
<p>First, generate the following migration:</p>
<p><code>priv/repo/migrations/20201217143615_create_users.exs</code></p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>Migrations</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUsers</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>:users</span><span>,</span> <span>primary_key:</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>:uuid</span><span>,</span> <span>primary_key:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>null:</span> <span>false</span>

      <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Don’t forget to run it:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">mix ecto.migrate</code></pre></figure>
<p>Now add the corresponding schema module:</p>
<p><code>lib/your_app/accounts/user.ex</code></p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Accounts</span><span>.</span><span>User</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Schema</span>
  <span>import</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Changeset</span>

  <span>@primary_key</span> <span>{</span><span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>,</span> <span>autogenerate:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span>

  <span>schema</span> <span>"</span><span>users"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>You can use string UUID format when building queries. Just remember always to prefix even the literal values with <code>^</code> because otherwise, you’ll get a somewhat cryptic error:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span># Incorrect</span>

<h3 id="generating-uuid-using-postgresql-function">Generating UUID using PostgreSQL function</h3>
<p><code>autogenerate: true</code> configures Ecto to generate random UUID values for newly created objects. Alternatively, you could generate UUIDs at the PostgreSQL level by editing your migration like that:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>Migrations</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUsers</span> <span>do</span>

    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>If you decide to do it, remember to use the <code>returning</code> option when inserting new objects. Without it, Ecto would not fetch default column values generated by PostgreSQL functions.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir">  <span>def</span> <span>create_user</span><span>(</span><span>attrs</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

<h3 id="using-uuid-as-a-default">Using UUID as a default</h3>
<p>If you’re starting a new project and would like all your schemas to leverage UUIDs for primary keys without customizing their migrations, you need to add the following line to your config file.</p>

<p>Changing the primary key type in the table is not straightforward. You need to start by running a similar migration that will create a new <code>uuid</code> column. Then rename the old <code>id</code> column to <code>integer_id</code>, unset it as the primary key in favor of the new <code>uuid</code> column after renaming it to <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>I will not detail how to migrate associations because it will differ for every use case. You need to follow the similar steps of adding a new GUID type column and based on the value from the old integer foreign key, you must assign correct UUID keys.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-of-working-with-uuid">Caveats of working with UUID</h2>
<h3 id="binary-logs">Binary logs</h3>
<p>You only need the string format to construct the UUID queries. Unfortunately, currently, Ecto displays the binary format in the logs, so you’ll need to do the manual conversion to work with them. I’ve <a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/pull/292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened a PR</a> trying to improve it.</p>
<p><img alt="Binary UUID format displayed in Elixir Phoenix logs" title="Binary UUID format displayed in Elixir Phoenix logs" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/uuid-binary-logs-611dd7b6b8e97ef17a33c1f45402ff8aadb410e0a4bce533f717415717dceb94.png"></p>
<p>Binary UUID format displayed in Phoenix logs</p>
<h3 id="implicit-ordering-issue">Implicit ordering issue</h3>
<p><code>first</code> and <code>last</code> Query.API methods may seem broken when used with UUIDs. By default, they sort objects based on their primary key.</p>
<p>Integer primary keys are generated sequentially. We can assume that the most recently created object will have the highest ID value.</p>
<p>On the contrary, due to UUID’s totally random nature, it is generated in a non-sequential order. PostgreSQL can still sort them using the deterministic algorithm. It means that a single UUID from the table will always have a first place when sorting. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with when it was generated compared to other UUID values from the same table.</p>
<p>It results in a seemingly buggy behavior of first and last methods. To remediate that, make sure to always explicitly pass the column name by which you want to sort your collection. In most cases, you’ll probably want to use <code>inserted_at</code> instead of <code>id</code>. One catch here is that the <code>inserted_at</code> column is not guaranteed to be unique. To avoid inconsistent results, always make sure to subsort your results by primary key:</p>

<p>BTW you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/ecto_extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EctoExtras package</a>. It implements a set of simple helper functions that I find missing from the default Ecto implementation. With <code>EctoExtras</code>, the above example could look like that:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>This will take you less than 5 minutes to get a private VPN on your own Ubuntu server.</p>
<p>What you need to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>a VPS (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS preferrably)</li>
<li>docker and docker-compose installed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-docker-compose"><a href="#setting-up-docker-compose">#</a> Setting up docker-compose</h2>
<p>On the VPS, I suggest to do the following:</p>
<p>Create a folder <code>wireguard/config</code> in your $HOME:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p wireguard/config
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the <code>wireguard</code> folder (next to the <code>config</code> folder), create the docker-compose file:</p>
<pre><code>vim docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>
<p>With the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>version: "2.1"
services:
  wireguard:
    image: linuxserver/wireguard
    container_name: wireguard
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Rome
      - SERVERURL=YOUR_IP_OR_DNS_NAME_OF_YOUR_SERVER #optional
      - SERVERPORT=51820
      - PEERS=5
    volumes:
      - /home/YOUR_USERNAME/wireguard/config:/config
      - /lib/modules:/lib/modules
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    restart: always
</code></pre>
<p>Simply change the <code>SERVERURL</code> variable, or delete that line if you want to use the server IP.</p>
<p>Additionally, change the location of your wireguard config path in the <code>volumes</code> section. (use <code>pwd</code> to get the current path you are in).</p>
<p><strong>For more info and environment variables, check out the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">linuxserver/wireguard doc</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve used <code>restart: always</code> so that WireGuard comes up after a system restart.</p>
<p>Changed <code>PEERS</code> to 5, so that I have 5 configurations available for my devices.</p>
<h2 id="launching-the-container"><a href="#launching-the-container">#</a> Launching the container</h2>
<p>Start the container in the background with</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the needed configurations in the <code>wireguard/config</code> folder.</p>
<p>The structure of your <code>wireguard</code> folder looks something like this</p>
<pre><code>.
├── config
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── coredns
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Corefile
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer1.conf
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer1.png
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── privatekey-peer1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── publickey-peer1
.............................
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── server
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── privatekey-server
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── publickey-server
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── templates
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer.conf
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── server.conf
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── wg0.conf
└── docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>
<h2 id="firewall-configuration"><a href="#firewall-configuration">#</a> Firewall configuration</h2>
<p>If you’re using <code>ufw</code>, simply enable the port <code>51820</code> so that you can connect to your server from outside:</p>
<pre><code>ufw enable 51820
ufw reload
</code></pre>
<p>If you run <code>sudo ufw status</code> you should see:</p>
<pre><code>Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ---      ----
....................................................
51820                      ALLOW       Anywhere
51820 (v6)                 ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="connecting-devices"><a href="#connecting-devices">#</a> Connecting devices</h2>
<p>Now you can <code>cat</code> or <code>scp</code> the configurations individually to your devices.</p>
<p>The configurations are located in the <code>config/peerX</code> folder, where <code>X</code> represents the peer number.</p>
<p>E.g. I could <code>cat/scp</code> the configuration in <code>wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.conf</code> and put it in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code> on my host machine.</p>
<p>View the configuration for peer 1 on your server with</p>
<pre><code>cat /home/YOUR_USERNAME/wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.conf
</code></pre>
<p>and place it in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code> on your host machine.</p>
<p>If you want to use <code>scp</code>, you could run the following on your local machine:</p>
<pre><code>scp <a href="https://cri.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9fcaccdacddfccdacdc9dacd">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
</code></pre>
<p>To connect to your newly created WireGuard VPN from one of your devices, you’ll need to install <code>wireguard-tools</code>.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>apt install wireguard-tools</code> , <code>pacman -S wireguad-tools</code> based on your distro</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">Here you can find a more detailed explanation</a></p>
<p>Now you can simply run <strong><code>wg-quick up wg0</code></strong> and you’re connected to your VPN.</p>
<p>Test it out by running <code>curl ipinfo.io</code> and inspect the output.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-mobile-device-with-qr-code"><a href="#connecting-mobile-device-with-qr-code">#</a> Connecting mobile device with QR code</h2>
<p>On your mobile device, install the WireGuard client.</p>
<p>Then add a new WireGuard tunnel by creating a new configuration scanning a QR code.</p>
<p>On your VPS run the following to output a QR code on the terminal that you can scan on your mobile device:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it wireguard app/show-peer 1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="inspecting-connections"><a href="#inspecting-connections">#</a> Inspecting connections</h2>
<p>If you want to understand who is connected and which profiles are in use, simply run the following on your VPS:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it wireguard wg
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you more information about your connections with the following output:</p>
<pre><code>interface: wg0
  public key: (redacted)
  private key: (hidden)
  listening port: 51820

peer: (redacted)
  endpoint: (redacted):51820
  allowed ips: (redacted)/32
  latest handshake: 27 seconds ago
  transfer: 5.04 MiB received, 172.64 MiB sent

...

peer: (redacted)
  allowed ips: (redacted)/32
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was most definitely the easiest way I found to connect computers and mobile devices to your own WireGuard VPN.</p>
<p>Let me know if you had troubles setting it up yourself!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>DynASM is a preprocessor and tiny runtime library for creating assemblers and JIT compilers in C or C++.</p>
        <p>DynASM was written for, and is maintained as part of, <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>. LuaJIT 1 used
           DynASM in a JIT role. LuaJIT 2 doesn't use DymASM in a JIT role, but LuaJIT 2's interpreter is hand-written in assembly,
           and it uses DynASM as a powerful cross-platform assembler.</p>
        <p>To get the latest copy of DymASM, run the following:</p>
        <pre><span>git clone http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git</span>
<span>cd luajit-2.0/dynasm</span></pre>
        <p>The <a href="http://luajit.org/dynasm.html">official documentation</a> for DynASM is extremely spartan, which can
           make it difficult to get started with DynASM. For using DynASM in a JIT role, this unofficial documentation's
           <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/tutorial.html">tutorial</a></strong> is recommended as a starting point. Once you're more familiar with DynASM,
           the <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/reference.html">reference</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/instructions.html">instruction listing</a></strong>
           pages are recommended reading for fleshing out your DynASM knowledge.</p>
        <p>Note that DynASM supports the x86, x64, ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS instruction sets, but this unofficial documentation
           only covers x86 and x64.</p>

		<p>Another day, another post telling me to do something, or not do something, or adopt some technology, or not adopt some technology, or whatever it is that they want me to do, because it makes it easier to “reason about the code”.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>More precisely, it’s a thought-terminating cliche. Ironic, as the phrase “reason about” is used as a highfalutin synonym for “think about”. The idea is that there’s nowhere to go from here. I want to do things one way, some random on medium dot com wants me to do things another way, their way makes it easier to reason about the code, therefore that’s the better approach.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that people don’t think—sorry, reason—about things the same way. If we did, then there’d be little point to things like film review sites, code style guides, or democracy. We don’t know precisely <em>what</em> influences different people to think in different ways about different things, but we have some ideas. Some of the ideas just raise other questions: like if you say “it’s a cultural difference” then we have to ask “well, why is it normal for all of the people in that culture to think this way, and all of the people in this culture to think that way?”</p>
<p>This difference between modes of thought arises in computing. We know, for example, that you can basically use any programming language for basically any purpose, because back in the days when there were intellectual giants in computering they demonstrated that all of these languages are interchangeable. They did so before we’d designed the languages. So choice of programming language is arbitrary, unless motivated by external circumstances like which vendor your CTO plays squash with or whether you are by nature populist or contrarian.</p>
<p>Such differences arise elsewhere than in choice of language. Comprehension of paradigms, for example: the Smalltalk folks noticed it was easier to teach object-oriented programming to children than to professional programmers, because the professional programmers already had mental toolkits for comprehending programming that didn’t integrate with the object model. It’s easier for them to “reason about” imperative code than objects.</p>
<p>OK, so when someone says that something makes it easier to “reason about” the code, what they mean is that <em>that person</em> find it easier to think about code in the presence of this property. I mean, assuming they <em>do</em>, and are not disingenuously proposing a suggestion that you do something when they’ve run out of reasons you should do it but still think it’d be a good idea.  But wait.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Code is a particular representation of, at best, <em>yesterday’s</em> understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve. “Reasoning about code” is by necessity accidental complexity: it’s reflecting on and trying to understand a historical solution of the problem as you once thought it was. That’s effort that could better be focussed on checking whether your understanding of the problem is indeed correct, or needs updating. Or on capturing a solution to an up-to-the-minute model of the problem in executable form.</p>
<p>This points to a need for code to be <em>deletable</em> way faster than it needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>Reasoning about code is a scam.</p>

				SSD`s are the life blood of our fmadio 10G, 40G, 100G ethernet capture systems. They provide backing storage that well exceeds that of conventional RAM, are super fast and light weight. Thus its prudent to keep the SSD farms in top nick, optimal health, and occasionally perform emergency room brain surgery on them. Unfortunately today is one of those days.
			</p>
			<br>

			<div>                        
				<ul>                            
					<li><img width="60%" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag_close.jpg" alt="ssd connected to jtag"></li>
				</ul>                        
			</div>


		<p>
As with all things, it happened late on a Friday night when I was adding a new feature to the system that wipes all capture data from the system. This is simple button click on the web UI page as our clients data is quite sensitive thus needs to be deleted when the box moves internally or externally. The wipe is implemented using the "Secure Erase" ATA-8 command, you can read all about it <a href="https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase">here</a>. Its essentially a restore-to-factory-setting operation. Meaning after the SecureErase the drive`s internal state is the same as "just left the factory". 
		</p>
		
		<p>
Which is great when it works, but this kind of low level drive formatting is pretty complicated with many (presumably) asynchronous operations going on in parallel... and doing 100 of these operations back to back at high speed is probably something the vendor did not expect (I was testing dammit!). In our case this bricked 6 SSD`s rendering them completely useless causing myself quite the stress as I now have several thousand dollars worth of inventory destroyed!  - not a good day.

</p><p>
The usual suspects to recover were tried and failed, leaving only a few options.
<br>
</p>

<h5>a) RMA the boards back to the seller<br>
b) Contact vendor support<br>
c) Perform surgery</h5>


<p>
Option a) of RMA`ing the boards was the safest option, tho usually you get some other previously recycled RMA`ed device back. Option b) of contacting the vendor is always such a brutally painful experience. It would likely end up with some random "Customer Support" person with a strange accent... giving the default completely useless response of RMA the device and get a replacement kind of thing... ho hum. Which leaves surgery! Now I usually don't go messing with hardware like this (anymore... :) ) because it takes up quite a bit time. However SSD health and prosperity is directly linked to our profitability thus deemed it a worth while time investment to have a more intimate relationship with our SSD models of choice. 
</p>
<br>

<div><p>
The process starts with a general reconnaissance mission of what pins are accessible, and what those pins are for. First up was finding the UART / serial interface but it was silent and likely disabled by the firmware. Next up was what most likely looked like a JTAG interface and... bingo, full JTAG interface connecting and operating as expected.
</p><p>

 JTAG is a hardware based system debugger that for CPU`s let you control instruction execution and read/write memory anywhere. You can see in the picture below some soldering of header pins was required, that is then wired to a breadboard which is wired to a Raspberry PI.
</p></div>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd with jtag connected"></p><div><p>
Raspberry PI? wtf ? In this case the Raspberry PI was converted into a JTAG debugger using the outstanding software over at <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>. As "real" JTAG debuggers are quite expensive ranging from $100 - $1000+ making OCD coupled with the PI an excellent low cost alternative. 
</p><p>

At this point you get a small rush as you gain access and poke the device, after which the vastness of having no idea what anything does starts to weigh you down. Then slowly bit by bit, instruction after instruction, string after string you gain some intuition on the memory map, what the code does, how its setup and eventually find something interesting.
</p></div> 

<p>

The first entry point to look for is the classic printf / trace / debug operation which gives you insight into what the software is doing. And eventually managed to track down the code that`s basically

<code>
void trace(char* Message, ...)
{ 
	va_arg list;
	va_start(arglist, Message);

	char buf[1024];
	vsprintf(buf, Message, arglist);

	if (debug_enable)
	{
		fwrite(output, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
</code>

which writes out a string to a console to tell the developer on whats going on. Note that the code has to "flatten" the string first before even deciding to output or not, which gives us a nice window to sniff the string with JTAG even if nothing is written to the console. 
</p>


<p>
After sniffing strings for a while and getting a better feel for whats happening noticed that the SSD is receiving commands from the SATA host no problem. But there`s some sort of funkyness going on that causes the SSD to send no response back - kind of a one-way-street. One idea to resolve this is: in theory the security erase operation restores everything back to good health. The question tho, is the device actually processing a security erase request ?  
</p>


<p>
... and using our printf JTAG sniffer... it most certainly is processing the request! But failing miserably due to an incorrect password. You can see the sniffed printf jtag string in the output below. Hint: <i>"&lt;SED&gt; Credential Comparison Failed"</i> ASCIIZ string.
</p>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_fail.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase fail"></p><p>
Which makes it clear why the security erase / factory reset failed but more importantly you can track down the offending bit of code from this string. That results in the following snippet of assembler courtesy of the IDA toolset below.
</p> 

<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_check.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password check"></p><p>
To decode that for you its doing a 32 byte long compare against some expected cryptographic hash key. Then the <i>"magic compare"</i> aka instruction <b>CMP R5, #1</b> is testing if the keys matched. Then doing a conditional jump to a printf routine based on that comparison result <b>BLNE sub_80...</b>. And finally  the functions return value is the result of the comparison <b>MOV R0, R5</b>. Nothing particularly fancy going on.
</p> 


<p>
There`s a few ways to go from here. One would be to reverse engineer how the 32B key is generated and create  a general purpose exploit. The other would be to just patch the binary such that it thinks it passed the security check. eg Fake a correct password response. We chose the latter as it only takes a few minutes and all I want is to restore the SSD farm`s health. Patching the binary with JTAG is trivial, console output is shown below.
</p> 


<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_patch.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password fake"></p><div><p>
The above shows disassembling the patched code first, the "before" section. This is to check we overwrite the correct bit of code. Then patch it using the command <b>cpu0 arm mww</b> with the value 0xe3a05001. Then disassemble again "after section" to confirm the patch worked and has the correct instruction. 
</p><p>

In this case we replaced <b>BLNE</b> instruction (print error message to the console) with <b>MOV r5, #1</b> at address 0x8009abe4 (shown in blue). The result of the "magic check" is 0 for fail, 1 for pass and write it to register r5. All we did is ignore the whole comparison and simply override it and say the security check always passes (r5 = 1).
</p></div> 

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Now its patched, with cpu`s resumed its the moment of truth. Issuing the security erase operation from the host system via hdparm. 
<br>
<code>
$ sudo hdparm --security-erase 1234  /dev/sdb
security_password="1234"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="1234, user=user
$
</code>
<br>
... and it worked! the SSD is back to life, working as normal and running at high speed!  ... with <b>several thousand dollars worth of SSD`s back in business</b> making our 10G, 40G, 100G network capture systems more resilient than ever. Now if the SSD vendor (who shall remain nameless) would fix the dam bug so excessive back-to-back security password/erase does NOT brick the device, life would be so much better. 
</p>

<p>For this series, you need an FPGA board with video output. We’ll be working at 640x480, so pretty much any video output will work. It helps to be comfortable with programming your FPGA board and reasonably familiar with Verilog.</p>
<p>We’ll be demoing the designs with two boards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/icebreaker/">iCEBreaker</a></strong> (Lattice iCE40) with <strong><a href="https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/pmod/dvi/">12-Bit DVI Pmod</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual">Digilent Arty A7-35T</a></strong> (Xilinx Artix-7) with <strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodvga/reference-manual">Pmod VGA</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>The SystemVerilog designs featured in this series are available from the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/">projf-explore</a> repo on GitHub. The designs are open source hardware under the permissive MIT licence, but this blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Aside: SystemVerilog?!</strong><br>
We’ll be using a few choice features from SystemVerilog to make Verilog a little more pleasant (no laughing at the back). If you’re familiar with Verilog, you’ll have no trouble.</p>

<h2 id="space-and-time">Space and Time</h2>
<p>The screen you’re looking at is a little universe with its own rules of space and time.</p>
<p>Looking at a screen from afar, you see a smooth two-dimensional image. Look more closely, and you see many individual blocks: these are <strong>pixels</strong>, made up of red, green, and blue components. A typical high-definition image is 1920 pixels across and 1080 lines down: over 2 million pixels in total. Even a 640x480 image has over 300,000 pixels. The need to handle so much information so quickly is a big part of the challenge of working with graphics at a hardware level.</p>
<p>A VGA cable has five main signals: red, green, blue, horizontal sync, and vertical sync. There are no addressing signals to tell the screen where to draw pixels; the secret is time, defined by the sync signals. The red, green, and blue wires carry the colour of each pixel in turn. Each pixel lasts a fixed length of time; when the display receives a <strong>horizontal sync</strong>, it starts a new line; when it receives a <strong>vertical sync</strong>, it begins a new frame. Showing many frames in quick succession provides the illusion of a moving image.</p>
<p>The sync signals are part of <strong>blanking</strong> intervals. Originally designed to allow an electron gun to move to the next line or top of the screen, blanking intervals have been retained and repurposed in contemporary displays: HDMI uses them to transmit audio. The blanking interval has three parts: <strong>front porch</strong>, <strong>sync</strong>, and <strong>back porch</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="display-timings">Display Timings</h2>
<p>In this series, we’re going to use <strong>640x480</strong> as our display resolution. Almost all displays support 640x480, and its low resource requirements make it simple to work with on small FPGAs. All the same principles apply at higher resolutions, such as 1280x720 or 4K.</p>
<p>We’ll use traditional horizontal and vertical timings, based on the original VGA monitor and adapter:</p>

<p>Taking blanking into account, we have a total of 800x525 pixels. A typical LCD refreshes 60 times a second, so the number of pixels per second is <code>800 x 525 x 60 = 25,200,000</code>, which equates to a <strong>pixel clock</strong> of 25.2 MHz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CAUTION: CRT Monitors</strong><br>
Any modern display, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisync_monitor">multisync CRTs</a>, should be fine with a 25.2 or 25 MHz pixel clock. Fixed-frequency CRTs, such as the original IBM 85xx series, could be damaged by an out-of-spec signal. Use these designs at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="running-to-time">Running to Time</h2>
<p>We’ve decided we need a pixel clock of 25.2 MHz pixel clock, but neither of our demo boards has such a clock. To reach the required frequency, we’re going to use a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">phase-locked loop</a></strong> (PLL). Almost all FPGAs include one or more PLLs, but there isn’t a standard way to configure them in Verilog, so we have to use vendor-specific designs.</p>
<p>We have provided implementations for Xilinx 7 Series (XC7) and Lattice iCE40; for other FPGAs, you’ll need to consult your vendor documentation. If you can’t reach 25.2 MHz exactly, then 25 MHz or thereabouts should be fine (but see note about CRTs, above). The iCE40 can’t generate 25.2 MHz using the oscillators on iCEBreaker but works fine at 25.125 MHz.</p>

<h2 id="display-timings-module">Display Timings Module</h2>
<p>Using our ~25 MHz pixel clock, we can generate timings for our 640x480 display. Creating display timings is straightforward: there’s one counter for horizontal position and one for vertical. We use these counters to decide on the correct time for sync signals.</p>

</code></pre></div><p><em>ProTip: The last assignment wins in Verilog, so the reset overrides the existing <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code>.</em></p>
<p><strong>sx</strong> and <strong>sy</strong> store the horizontal and vertical position; their maximum values are 800 and 525 respectively, so we need 10 bits to hold them (2<sup>10</sup> = 1024). <strong>de</strong> is <em>data enable</em>, which is low during the blanking interval: we use it to decide when to draw pixels.</p>
<p>Display modes vary in the polarity of their sync signals; for traditional 640x480, the polarity is negative for both <strong>hsync</strong> and <strong>vsync</strong>. Negative polarity means the voltage is mostly high, with low voltage indicating a sync signal.</p>
<p>The following simulation shows the vertical sync starting at the 490th line (counting starts at zero):</p>

<h2 id="test-benches">Test Benches</h2>
<p>You can exercise the designs with the included test benches (Xilinx only):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/common/xc7/clock_gen_tb.sv">Clock Gen Test Bench</a></strong> (Xilinx 7 Series)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/common/xc7/display_timings_tb.sv">Display Timings Test Bench</a></strong> (Xilinx 7 Series)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the pixel clock period?</li>
<li>How long does the pixel clock take to lock?</li>
<li>Does a frame last exactly 1/60th of a second?</li>
<li>How much time does a single line last?</li>
<li>What is the maximum values of <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code> when <code>de</code> is low?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can find instructions for running the simulation in the source <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-graphics">README</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="top-display">Top Display</h2>
<p>Now we have our display signals we’re ready to start drawing. To begin, we’re going to keep it simple and draw a coloured square. When the screen x and y coordinates are both less than 32 we draw in orange; otherwise, we use blue. Because our colour output has 4 bits per channel, we can use a single hex digit from 0-F to represent the intensity of red, green, and blue.</p>
<p>There are two versions of this top module, one for each demo board:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xilinx XC7: <strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/blob/master/fpga-graphics/xc7/top_square.sv">xc7/top_square.sv</a></strong></li>

              <p><span>S</span>ix months ago, <a href="https://osjobs.net/co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overseas Rabbit Course</a> started using a new pricing model. After applying the new strategy, revenue from each customer has increased by 2000%. According to this data, the new pricing strategy gained great success. Of course, it would be risky by inferring causation of success from numbers. But after such a large increase in revenue, this article will analyze the reasons behind it.</p>

<p>Overseas Rabbit Course is an interview course for programmers including resume review and mock interview services. The previous pricing model is quite straight forward. It started in April 2018, the day Overseas Rabbit went online. our original pricing model charged a uniform price to each customer for the same course. Customers choose the desired course and pay for it, then we apply the related course for them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OSJobs/osjobs-info@master/assets/imgs/old%20price.png" alt="Old pricing model"></p>
<p>Just like other service platforms, a common problem for this pricing model is to find the best price to achieve profit maximization, so we adjusted the price in a while. Under the premise that the reduction of price would lead to more customers. However, it didn’t work well. Reflecting on the failure, the wide adopted pricing strategy might not be the one most suitable for our service even though it is used everywhere.</p>

<p>Until June 2020, a customer proposed to use 50% of his monthly salary to pay for our course. It reminds me of another programmer course I have seen before. It is also charged in proportion to the salary. I had doubts about this pricing model at that moment for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paying by proportion is much more expensive than a fixed fee. The median salary of Chinese programmers is about 12,000 yuan, and 50% of the salary is almost 10 times more than the original fee. I’m not sure how many customers are willing to pay for it.</li>
<li>Job hunting is a combination of ability and luck. Some customers may take a few months to be successfully recruited. Such uncertainty may cause unstable revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, after we found a customer who is willing to pay by proportion. We made some adjustments to the course content and adopted a dynamic charging strategy. <strong>Nowadays, all of our courses are free to join, and we charge 50% of the customer’s salary only after they have been recruited successfully.</strong> I call this pricing strategy Proportional Pricing Model. I believe someone must have discovered it earlier than me and has named it, such as the programmer course I saw before. (Welcome to leave a comment if you found the source. ) Surprisingly, under the new pricing model, there are more customers than before, and we successfully increased our revenue by 20 times recently.</p>

<p>In the beginning, we thought that customers wanted to improve the skill for interviewing, but we were wrong. What customers really need is getting a job, <strong>and there is a huge difference between them.</strong> Most people will only judge the quality of the course based on the result after completing it. Under the previous price model, customers will balance between the course cost and interview skills obtained with their criterion. But now, the Proportional Pricing Model closely connects the recruitment certainty with our course so customers would balance the course cost with the success of recruitment.</p>

<li>Proportional Pricing Model means the payment varies with the customer income, customers cannot know the actual number they will pay before getting the job which will make them feel less expensive.</li>
<li>Proportional payment is fairer. Higher cost means a higher salary. Customers should expect to pay as much as possible because it means they have a higher salary.</li>
<li>Percentages cannot be directly compared. If setting a fixed fee, such as 6,000 yuan per customer, the customer can directly compare 6,000 yuan with what he/she could purchase, such as books or other courses.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Usually, customers subscribe to the service because of a certain episode, and they will cancel their subscription after watching it (the first-month cancellation rate of streaming media platforms is higher than 40%). Therefore, streaming media platforms need to continuously spend money on producing new content or purchasing copyrights, which would bring a lot of costs.</p>

<p>Some platforms want customers to automatically renew so they try different ways to prevent users from canceling, like bad UI, complicated steps, etc. Moreover, no customer feels they could take advantage of the same price.</p>
<ol>
<li>Customers who watch less (like me) will regret that they have spent too much on subscription fees. I hate monthly subscriptions, even though the monthly subscription price is cheaper than one cup of coffee.</li>
<li>Customers who watch more will not be satisfied as well for the following two reasons: 1) Because there are a huge amount of videos, it’s difficult to measure how many videos you need to watch to get the fee back. 2) Mostly, watching videos is just a kind of entertainment. People may feel guilty if they spend too much time on it every month, and it leads to subscription cancellation.</li>

<p>With Proportional Pricing Model, I propose a new way to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customers can join streaming media membership for free and they can watch everything from the platform.</li>
<li><strong>The platform will charge the customer only if his/her monthly watching time is top 30% among all customers</strong>. For example, if Youtube has 10 million members, only 3 million customers will be charged every month, 7 million customers can enjoy services for free.</li>

<li>Charging everyone a fixed price is unfair. Just like electricity bills, charging everyone the same price bill will cause controversy. Therefore, members are charged based on how long they watched is more reasonable.</li>
<li>Everyone likes free products. who will cancel them when auto-renew is free.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Go 1.16 will make system calls through libc on OpenBSD</h2>

	<p><small>February  1, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the unusual things about <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is that
it started out with the approach of directly making system calls
on Unix, instead of calling the standard C library functions that
correspond to those system calls. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoCLibraryAPIIssues">There are reasonably good reasons
for Go to make direct system calls</a> and this
works well on Linux, but other Unixes are different. The official
API for Illumos and Solaris system calls requires you to use their
C library, and OpenBSD wants you to do this as well for security
reasons (for <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806776/">OpenBSD system call origin verification</a>). Go has used the C library on
Solaris and Illumos for a long time, but through Go 1.15 it made
direct system calls on OpenBSD and so current released versions of
OpenBSD had a special exemption from their system call origin
verification because of it.</p>

<p>The news of the time interval for Go 1.16 is that this is changing. To
quote from the current draft release notes (which are probably soon to
be the official release notes):</p>

<blockquote><p>On the 64-bit x86 and 64-bit ARM architectures on OpenBSD (the
<code>openbsd/amd64</code> and <code>openbsd/arm64</code> ports), system calls are now
made through <code>libc</code>, instead of directly using the <code>SYSCALL/SVC</code>
instruction. This ensures forward-compatibility with future versions
of OpenBSD. In particular, OpenBSD 6.9 onwards will require system
calls to be made through <code>libc</code> for non-static Go binaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, Go programs that look up host names or do a few other
operations are very likely to not be statically linked. You can force
static linking (and you'll normally get it if you cross-build), but it
has some drawbacks for hostname lookups in some configurations and you
can't do some other operations at all.</p>

<p>At one level everything is okay with this situation. OpenBSD 6.9 will
almost certainly include Go 1.16 in its ports collection, since it will
be the only version of Go that works on it, and from there you can build
Go programs that will run fine on 6.9. At another level, any dynamically
linked Go program you have will need to be rebuilt with Go 1.16 before
you can run it on OpenBSD 6.9. Hopefully you have the source code and
can still build it (in what will be a 'modular by default' world in Go
1.16). This is nothing really new for OpenBSD, which has always made it
clear that they don't promise ABI or even API compatibility; you always
need to be prepared to rebuild your programs for new OpenBSD versions,
and perhaps to update them to more secure APIs.</p>

<p>(Statically linked Go programs built by Go 1.15 or earlier will likely
keep working on OpenBSD 6.9, assuming that there are no other ABI
changes that affect them. But you should probably plan to rebuild them
with Go 1.16 just to be sure. I don't know what the situation will be
if you want to create Go binaries that work across a range of OpenBSD
versions.)</p>

<p>As the release notes say, Go 1.16 will make system calls through libc
for all programs, whether they're dynamically linked or statically
linked. Right now OpenBSD only requires this for dynamically linked
programs (well, will require it), but always calling via libc is simpler
than to maintain two sets of system call code. And someday OpenBSD may
do something more elaborate so that making system calls via libc is
required even for statically linked programs.</p>

<div>

                                <p><span>CloudLinux is proud to announce the release of AlmaLinux Beta. We’ve collected community feedback and built our new beta release around what you would expect from an enterprise-level Linux distribution. AlmaLinux is a completely free 1:1 binary compatible fork of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, inspired by the community and built by the engineers and talent behind CloudLinux. Visit <a href="https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/">this link</a></span><span>&nbsp;to download Beta images.</span></p>

<p><span>With the Beta release deployed, we’d like to ask the community to be involved and provide feedback. We aim to build a Linux distribution entirely from community contributions and feedback. During AlmaLinux Beta, we ask for assistance in testing, documentation, support and future direction for the operating system. Together, we can build a Linux distribution that fills the gap left by the now unsupported CentOS distribution.</span></p>
<p><span>The AlmaLinux team set up all the necessary infrastructure to make it convenient for our contributors to provide their input. The public repository on </span><a href="https://github.com/AlmaLinux"><span>Github</span></a><span> is where we will finalize the source code for the system, and any additional documentation will be posted on the </span><a href="https://wiki.almalinux.org/"><span>wiki</span></a><span>. We set up the wiki and repository to make it easy for the community to provide as much information and feedback as possible. The AlmaLinux team will review every comment and request, but we ask that only registered contributors </span><a href="https://bugs.almalinux.org/login_page.php"><span>file bug reports</span></a><span> to filter out spam.</span></p>
<p><span>To facilitate communication and help answer some of the common questions you might already have, we will be hosting a live QA webinar with the AlmaLinux team. </span><span>The webinar will take place on February 10, </span><span>5 PM (UTC) / 9 AM (PST). Among the participants present will be Igor Seletskiy, CEO of CloudLinux, and Alexander Vinogradov, Head of Engineering at AlmaLinux.</span></p>
<p><span>You can sign up for our webinar </span><a href="https://blog.almalinux.org/webinars/almalinux-beta-qa-webinar/"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any questions, comments, feedback or concerns, please feel free to send us your thoughts to </span><a href="https://blog.almalinux.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f199949d9d9eb1909d9c909d989f8489df9e8396"><span><span data-cfemail="8de5e8e1e1e2cdece1e0ece1e4e3f8f5a3e2ffea">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></span></a><span> or send them during the webinar on Twitter with the hashtag #AlmaLinuxBeta.</span></p>
<p><span>CloudLinux and the AlmaLinux team would like to thank the community for their input. This is just the beginning for AlmaLinux, and we look forward to continued improvements and updates for the next generation enterprise-level Linux operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your contribution, input, and support throughout launching AlmaLinux! The infrastructure was the first step, now we need your help to make the next one!</span></p>


<p><strong>Release Notes for AlmaLinux 8 beta</strong></p>

The point is that YouTube video hosting users have noticed the following, to put it mildly, oddity. When trying to upload video content with the Russian anthem to their channels, bloggers were faced with warnings that this allegedly violates the copyrights of some American copyright holders. </p><p>Blogger Yuri Khovansky tried to figure out the situation when he was faced with a warning from the video hosting about “controversial content”.</p><p>It turned out that the music of the Russian anthem, written in Soviet times by the composer Alexander Alexandrov, was somehow "privatized" by the American corporation BMI. Bloggers note that now, in order to use the video with the anthem of Russia on your YouTube channel, you must submit an application to the "copyright holder". Phantasmagoria…</p><p>A detailed study of the situation revealed that this is not only the case with the Russian anthem on YouTube. It turned out that a few months ago this video hosting showed a tendency in which Western companies, including those in the music business, submitted data on the "ownership" of a number of Soviet songs, marches, etc. Thus, the American company The Orchard Music "registered rights "to the Soviet musical compositions" Victory Day "and" Holy War ". This was followed by a whole ninth wave of American "privatization" of Soviet cultural heritage on YouTube. The "rights" of American companies were registered in respect of those songs of Soviet performers who had the largest number of streams on the Internet.</p><p>Thus, it should be stated that American video hosting is actually trying to legitimize outright digital raiding or even piracy, while also encouraging it. This is another example of how far the American digital giants have gone, considering themselves the right to dispose of not only user accounts, but also cultural<a href="https://en.topwar.ru/history/" title="история">historical</a> heritage, to which they themselves have nothing to do.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="penci-post-entry-inner"><p>I recently read through a Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25346851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thread</a> discussing the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> “Kafka Is Not A Database”, by <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>. The opinions behind this topic are fascinating and I enjoyed sifting through comments from both sides of the table. For the purposes of this post, I’ve labeled these two broad groups of thoughts as Team Blue and Team Red.</p><p>Team Blue believes that <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kafka</a>, a popular streaming platform, has the potential to be the source-of-truth for your data—replacing one of the key responsibilities of conventional databases.</p><p>Team Red strongly disagrees.</p><p>The following is high-level summary of these opinions.</p> <h2><strong>Kafka As A Database</strong></h2><h3>TL;DR Streams,Events,Kafka</h3><p>First, a conceptual model of streams:</p><blockquote><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, a&nbsp;<strong>stream</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence">sequence</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element">data elements</a>&nbsp;made available over time.&nbsp;A stream can be thought of as items on a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt">conveyor belt</a>&nbsp;being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Imagine that you’ve hired an invisible assistant. This assistant’s only responsibility is to record everything you do:</p><ol><li>Wakes up @ 8 am</li><li>Brushes teeth @ 8:35 am</li><li>Begins showering @ 8:40 am</li><li>…</li></ol><p>As you go about your day, your assistant meticulously captures your activity and adds new entries into your daily log. This growing log represents a <strong>stream </strong>of your day-to-day activity. The data elements that comprise the stream are known as <strong>events</strong>. Once an event is recorded, it is immutable; the fact that you brushed your teeth at 8:35 am yesterday will never change.</p><p>While your invisible assistant is following you around and <strong>producing</strong> new events to your stream, who is <strong>consuming</strong> them? Anyone who cares! I’m sure your mom would be thrilled to process through your activities and call you if there are any anomalies.</p><p>What about <strong>Kafka</strong>?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open-source</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stream-processing</a>&nbsp;software platform developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Software Foundation</a>, written in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scala</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java</a>.&nbsp;</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Kafka is a platform (large set of software tools) that helps programmers work with streams.</p><h2>Team Blue – Streams Everywhere</h2><p>Team Blue believes that streams are a natural model for both life and computing. Your users produce a stream of clicks, sign-ups, and orders. Your code produces a stream of logs, metrics, and programmatic events. Team Blue believes that the intuitive nature of streams can lead to intuitive software architectures.</p><p>An essential component of any system is the database—a convenient place to read and write whatever you want. How can a stream replace this concept that we are so used to? If streams are a never-ending series of immutable events, then the property of state is the culmination of events up to a certain point in time. For example, the latest state of a database is the culmination of all operations made to that database. In computing, this is referred to as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Event Sourcing</a>. This paradigm is very different to how many developers are used to thinking about their data.</p><p>Beyond data storage, Team Blue is bullish on the idea of stream-focused architectures in general. Streams work well with microservices, promote loose coupling of systems, and have the potential to create leverage in your software. If you’re thinking about streams, you will inevitably think about Kafka—one of the industry’s leading streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Can</strong> you use Kafka as a database? Team Blue says yes.</p><p><strong>Should</strong> you use Kafka as a database? That’s up to you.</p><h2>Team Red – You Need Databases</h2><p>On the other side of the table is Team Red who believes that programmers are making a mistake by replacing conventional databases with Kafka.</p><p>Team Red believes that 99% of applications need the features of a conventional database—especially the features handling complex concurrency issues. Many of us use these features and they are critical for the success of our applications. Modern databases are battle-tested and have been iterated on for decades. Team Red believes that the message of “Kafka As A Database” is a dangerous message that leads developers into architectures they’re not equipped to handle.</p><h2>The People On Each Team</h2><p>There is no shortage of influential people who align with Team Blue. One notable engineer is <a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Kreps</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Confluent</a>. Confluent is an organization that sells Kafka as a solution to enterprises. There is a direct correlation between using streams and using Kafka; I’m sure Jay has a few extra reasons to be bullish on streams beyond his personal software architecture preferences.</p><p>Another influencer aligned with Team Blue is <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Kleppmann</a>, author of the extremely popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>. Martin Kleppmann is a researcher who loves the idea of streams. His goal is to educate as many programmers as possible. Martin’s only qualm with Team Red’s opinion is the tone of their blog post. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl/status/1336336852890963977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Nice blog post [Kafka Is Not A Database] explaining why the “database inside out” approach is not for everyone. <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun">@narayanarjun</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew">@frasergeorgew</a> are right —&nbsp;if you need to maintain constraints before events are written (e.g. not selling more items than you have in stock), it’s easier to use a DB and CDC.</p><p>On the other hand, the message is also a bit patronising. It basically says “you’re not clever enough to use an event log correctly — leave database stuff to the experts”. I respectfully disagree: it is good to explore new approaches. Learn about the trade-offs, educate yourself.</p><cite>Martin Kleppmann</cite></blockquote><p>Engineers on Team Red’s side include <a href="https://materialize.com/author/arjun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://materialize.com/author/george-fraser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>, co-authors of the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> which refutes the idea of “Kafka As A Database.” They have decided to put a large, yellow caution sign in front of Team Blue’s message. Team Red has no issue with Kafka or streams; they have an issue with eager developers throwing out their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDMSs</a> and jumping on the stream bandwagon. Their only extra agenda might be to get extra eyeballs on their engineering blogs.</p><h2>Arguments From Team Blue</h2><p>The following points are summaries of topics discussed in Martin Kleppmann’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0&amp;t=2089s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>.</p><h3>High Integrity Data – Never Deleted</h3><p>With a database, your information is easily susceptible to being lost. Once your Postgres row is updated, it’s difficult to recover the previous state of that row without introducing custom accountability software. Databases and the records inside them are designed to be mutable. It’s both a great convenience and a great risk. If a table accidentally gets deleted, you might find yourself scrambling to restore your database from a backup. This is particularly painful in production.</p><p>On the other hand, if your data exists as a log of immutable events—and that log happens to be retained forever—the history of your changes never runs the risk of being erased. Accounting is a great example of this—accountants balance their books by only appending new entries to their ledgers. An error in a financial transaction is always fixed by another transaction.</p><p>Team Blue believes that this characteristic can be an asset to software architectures. As a permanent log of events, data will always have its historical context and can easily be audited. Furthermore, the lack of an “eraser” forces programmers and processes to be held highly accountable for their actions.</p><div> <p><span>Trade-Off</span>: </p><p> One concern of storing all your data in a log is that the size of your logs may become unwieldy over time. Do we really care about how a customer changed their email 3 years ago or do we only care about what it is today? Large Kafka logs can also complicate consumers—catching up from offset 0 may not be so easy. Kafka has implemented features like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Log Compaction </a> to mitigate this. However, this is yet another complexity for programmers to manage and debug. </p><p> Another trade-off of this architecture is that it can become cumbersome for privacy concerns. There are administrative use-cases (GDPR) when you are required to completely <strong>hard delete</strong> all of your customer’s personal information from your system. This takes additional effort if the data to be deleted is scattered across logs and storage systems.</p></div><h3>Separation Of Concerns – Reading / Writing</h3><p>Team Blue points out that one of the great conveniences of databases is also one of its greatest challenges. The convenience of databases is undeniable—an easy one-stop shop to read and write anything. The drawback to being a one-stop shop is that you can’t be the best at any <strong>one</strong> thing, which becomes problematic as you scale.</p><p>Conventional databases easy conflate reads and writes, two very different styles of operations. As you scale, the access patterns in your software will inevitably force you to optimize for a certain set of operations. If an operation-specific optimization is done in a centralized location, it will likely degrade the performance of other operations in that location. If you optimize reads, you complicate writes—and vice versa.</p><p>One of the first steps in optimizing SQL reads is to begin denormalizing (duplicating) data across various tables. Once your data is duplicated, queries require less joins and respond faster. However, the drawback of denormalization is that it creates additional complications on the write pathway. Programmers need to remember to update and synchronize the duplicated data across multiple tables.</p><p>This pattern grows in complexity as you scale. If denormalization isn’t getting you the required read performance, the usual next step is to introduce a cache in front of your database. A cache is extremely convenient and can be designed to precisely answer the questions your clients are asking. However, as many programmers are intimately aware of, maintaining a cache is never easy. You now to need synchronize writes across network boundaries, worry about distributed transactions, and debug subtle invalidation issues.</p><p>Going back to our make-believe example, my assistant only has <strong>one</strong> responsibility—log my daily activity. One day, I decide that I want to look back in time to see how my activities are categorized. Unfortunately, I can’t ask my assistant this question because it’s too specific; all he knows how to do is produce events. To get insights on my activity, …</p></div></div></div>

<p>2 million full-time “content creators,” outside any professional sanction; the election of Donald Trump against an airtight media consensus certain of its impossibility; mass, hysterical preference falsification due to a normalization of political correctness, with silent mass migration into countless private communities; Big Tech’s capitulation to censorship on all major social platforms; the resilient rise in the price of Bitcoin and a proliferation of <a href="https://forefront.market/ranking">durable social currencies on Ethereum;</a> and most recently, an unprecedented execution of decentralized social intelligence, which minted more than a few millionaires out of thin air, by <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/05408a92">a niche internet community hacking the source code of finance capitalism.</a></p>
<p>Most of the essential requirements for a functioning polity—fiat currency, leaders, laws, and shared identity—have been fully decoded and open-sourced in the form of cryptocurrencies, content creators, Smart Contracts, and fandoms. It seems inevitable that our roughly 195 nation states must increasingly give way to thousands of digital micro-polities, as these embryonically political structures grow in economic and psychological power.</p>
<p>The only other defining characteristic of autonomous polities—a monopoly on the use of force—is increasingly obsolete as the payoff to peaceful trade raises the opportunity cost of physical violence. Hence the relative dearth of interstate war since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>If you doubt the claim that “content creators” are budding politicians—whether they know it or not—consider the curious case of Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>The most powerful Youtubers are accidentally rediscovering the nature of Aristocracy, a type of social role we like to think we abolished.</p>
<p>Mr. Beast is a Youtuber who currently enjoys 52 million subscribers and earns somewhere in the ballpark of $20-30 million annually at the age of 22. Jimmy Donaldson built one of the most influential and economically successful Youtube channels through a specific concept: Outrageous and conspicuous acts of generosity. His typical video involves him gifting large sums of money or lavish objects to random people, poor people, or friends.</p>
<p>As true aristocrats have always known, and as contemporary elites have forgotten, lavish generosity towards the needy demonstrates one’s authentic nobility, wins public attention and admiration, and genuinely improves society while increasing the political and economic power of the donor.</p>
<p>The so-called “creator economy” is only a becoming-liquid of the circuit connecting noble traits, admiration, and capital, such that the previously abolished form of Aristocracy re-appears in a distributed and ungovernable format. You could try to govern it, but you would need someone as organically admirable as the target, or else Mr. Beast fans will never even hear about your new law, let alone respect it (especially after they upload themselves full-time to the Mr. Beast VR pod and earn all of their income through Mr. Beast’s branded gaming engine). National law enforcement does not generally excel in the domain of authentic nobility, ergo the new form of distributed Aristocracy will not be put back in the bottle.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting Mr. Beast will become the effective President of a new country within the United States. I am suggesting Mr. Beast will be one of <em>thousands</em> who effectively constitute micro-polities, each one optimizing for different personality types and demographic buckets. Power laws dictate a small minority of creators will enjoy audiences far larger than the rest, but I suspect at least several thousands of creators will operate all-inclusive <em>weltanschauungen</em> for audiences of several thousands. I am pulling these specific numbers out of thin air, but I am directionally confident; I would encourage someone to explore more sophisticated modeling of this question.</p>
<p>If you still doubt that someone like Mr. Beast is an embryonic statesman, you might be impressed to learn about his long-term goal. His stated goal is to create a nation-wide system of homeless shelters and food banks. That’s right, he’s going to build a <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/19/mrbeast-philanthropy-food-bank/">national system of public housing.</a> I see no reason why he cannot succeed, given that he has already proven a business model that turns charismatic philanthropy into attention, admiration, and wealth for himself. Given that the USA Department of Housing and Urban Development doesn’t even try to create housing any more, it is not particularly speculative or sci-fi to suggest that Mr. Beast is on his way to becoming a kind of shadow Secretary of Housing in the United States. It’s there for the taking, it’s his stated goal, and he’s on track to do it. If he falters, it’s hard to imagine that the next generation of creators will also fail to appreciate such historic opportunities in front of them.</p>
<p>Bitcoin feeds directly into content creators becoming governors, not additively but multiplicatively—in a few ways. This means you should watch out for non-linear takeoffs, where things seem to be unfolding gradually, gradually… and then all at once.</p>
<p>First of all, Bitcoin is becoming the leading inflation-hedge asset as the US government engages in unprecedented money printing. Censorship-resistant and inflation-proof money is becoming increasingly accessible, normalized, and trusted at the same time that legacy institutions are doubling down on… censorship and inflation. It’s not inconceivable that eventually the US government needs Bitcoin—and the intellectual/communication services of leading content creators—much more than anyone needs the US government. If the US government’s balance sheet gets worse, and Bitcoin continues to get better, this alone could trigger a non-linear event where all smart money rushes into Bitcoin rapidly, and the US government’s balance sheet collapses with equal rapidity.</p>
<p>Second, most of the leading content creators have hardly even begun utilizing cryptocurrency. They will. Given the mimetic nature of financial value, leading Youtubers could single-handedly increase the price of any given cryptocurrency, simply by promoting it, using it, and whipping their fans into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Just recently Elon Musk put the word “Bitcoin” in his Twitter profile and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/elon-musk-prompted-bitcoin-price-surge-causes-liquidation-of-387m-in-shorts">the price of Bitcoin immediately rose 15%.</a> If for any reason Bitcoin becomes fashionable among leading creators, the result will be non-linear. The creators would be making themselves even richer, simply by adopting Bitcoin and triggering price increases, so I consider this to be a game-theoretic inevitability (even if many don’t want to take this opportunity at time t1, rising creators who do take this opportunity at time t2 will dominate the others, which means it is hard to imagine a future in which this opportunity is not taken).</p>
<p>Just as we watched the Reddit community Wallstreetbets pump the price of Gamestop on the stock exchange, without a leader, any community with a leader will be all the more capable of such a feat. The Robinhood app was able to halt purchases of Gamestop, but there already exist decentralized crypto exchanges, on which nobody has the power to halt trades. Technically unstoppable versions of the Gamestop pump therefore seem inevitable on decentralized exchanges, meaning communities will eventually have unprecedented power to affect the value of assets by sheer belief and collective will.</p>
<p>There is already a new breed of avant-garde content creators—small compared to Mr. Beast but large enough to be dangerous—investing heavily in crypto assets and infrastructure. Consider Trevor McFedries, creator of the first CGI influencer Lil’ Miquela. He’s minted his own social currency $FWB on the Ethereum blockchain, and its value has been <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits">rising steadily</a> as the value of his community increases. If he and his community continue to create value inside the community, the value of $FW will continue to rise, and everyone in the community will see their wealth increase in proportion to their $FWB holdings. It is hard to imagine that there will not eventually be a creator as big as Mr. Beast and as crypto-savvy as McFedries, who runs a private digital community with a market cap as great as the GDP of many countries.</p>
<p>The most influential content creators will build cabinets of advisors and shareholders drawn from different domains: A chief technologist drawn from Silicon Valley, a chief financial officer drawn from Wall Street, etc. This is when the political nature of content creators will become unmistakable. These companies will look and feel like small national governments, running a combination of revenue-generating enterprises for profit and philanthropic enterprises for citizen-recruitment, all organized around their own state-sponsored media.</p>
<p>The nation state may well persist, but only as a shell of its former self, and mainly by hitching its wagon to the leading micro-polities. One can imagine a scenario in which Heads of State and leading content creators broker an informal bargain that allow Heads of State to save face on condition they defer to the new power-holders. In the near future, the relationship of the US President and leading American Youtubers may be analogous to the relationship between the Queen of England and Parliament.</p>
<p>Many micro-polities will initially appear to mainstream observers as religious “cults,” driven by “conspiracy theories,” led by charismatic “grifters,” operating massive “pyramid schemes.” Eventually it will be realized that such things have always been the building blocks of nations. As the myth of Romulus attests, the founding of a nation is always a crime—until it’s the law.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in 2015, I discovered a surprising security vulnerability that allowed you to run malicious JavaScript code on the Google search engine results page, which might be one of the most secure pages on the internet given how much daily traffic it recieves. It wasn’t until <a href="#the-fix">4 years later (or 2019) that they finally closed the case on it</a> and I could share it without breaking my nondisclosure agreement with Google.</p><p>This sounds like a lot like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS attack</a>, which you would imagine Google would sanitize for, but it’s not and it’ll soon become clear why as I explain.</p><p>I was on Google searching for something like <em>“text-to-speech javascript libraries”</em>. I went from the Google search results page to clicking the first result, back to the Google search results page, to clicking on the second result, back to the Google search results page, etc. What I noticed was that my speakers kept making a clicking noise, like they were turning on and off—but just for a second.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/google-search.png" loading="lazy" width="340"></figure><p>I thought maybe there was some other program running on my computer or that my speakers were busted, but I realized it happened everytime I went to the Google search results page for this query. It also happened everytime I went to the first search results page, which was of a company that had a demo of their text-to-speech solution on it.</p><p>I figured the company’s page was loading their text-to-speech engine, that seemed to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">SpeechSynthesis interface of the WebSpeech API</a>, and that’s why the speakers were turning on. But why were they on the Google page? That seemed like Google was maybe pulling in code on the search results page from the company’s page. That should never happen though, surely Google sanitizes anything that ever gets displayed on their pages from containing HTML or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>This seemed like a plausible attack vector if there was some bug that allowed you to bring arbitrary code on to the Google search results page and a huge one at that.</p><p>I dumped the source code of the search results page and started looking at the HTML around the search result, but it didn’t look like any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or HTML tags were making it through. I started looking for instances of the company’s domain and found something like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"prerender"</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://thecompanyspage.com/example"</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>I was not familiar with <code>rel="prerender"</code> myself in 2015. Indeed, it seemed to be some sort of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-resource-hints-20150717/#dfn-prerender">new mechanism for pre-fetching and pre-loading a page</a> to speed up page transistions and load times as an optimization.</p><p>Google seemed to have invented <code>rel="prerender"</code> to prefetch and load the first search result in the background, so that when you clicked on the first search result (as most users do), it would instantly be ready for viewing.</p><p>The <code>rel="prerender"</code> has to execute JavaScript to load dynamic content, but it wasn’t blocking the WebSpeech API from playing audio possibly. Luckily for Google, the pre-rendered content is loaded in its own origin and, therefore, sensitive resources like cookies on the Google page were not at risk from being harvested by attackers like they would be in an XSS attack.</p><p>After learning this, the next step was to prove this out with my own website on Google’s search results page and see what I could make of it.</p><p>I needed a long obscure phrase that I could get the #1 Google search result spot for and that no one would accidently stumble upon so I could keep the vulnerability relatively secret until Google could fix it. I chose the apt phrase “Alphabet Spoke to Me In My Dreams” and purchased the <code>alphabetspoketomeinmydreams.xyz</code> domain name (now expired) that would show up as the first Google search result for the phrase. This was around the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/technology/google-alphabet-restructuring.html">Google restructured into Alphabet Inc</a>.</p><p>The first malicious thing I could think to do was to “vandalize” the Google search results page with one of those “win a prize” scams pretending to be Google to phish their users. I also thought it would be sufficiently creepy to show how you were able to access standard information about the user like their location, ISP, IP address while being prerendered and speak it back to them. I know <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/iZ6bamP8wZk?t=46">Dwight Schrute would be scared of that</a>.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFlquq0GcY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio on the Google search results page.</figcaption></figure><p>So this looks pretty bad, but you would think that a user might notice if they click on the first result that it was a 3rd-party page causing the audio to play not Google right? Yes, except you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/hidden"><code>document.hidden</code> property</a> to detect prerender mode and condition your code so that it only runs in <code>rel="prerender"</code> mode on the Google search engine results page! This creates a pretty robust appearance for impersonation as nothing happens if you go to the page directly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.hidden) {
  <span>// The page is being loaded in rel="prerender", run the WebSpeech API code
</span><span></span>} <span>else</span> {
  <span>// The page is being loaded normally, don't do anything
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="chrome-vulnerability">Chrome Vulnerability</h2><p>While testing this, I found that this doesn’t only work on the Google search results page, but it turns out Chrome also “prerenders” the first result of the autocomplete in the URL search bar. Therefore, you can start playing WebSpeech audio without even having a page loaded in the browser frame.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqyOnzGDRlg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Chrome Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio in the Chrome browser before any page is loaded in the browser at all when triggered by a user typing in a search into the URL search bar.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="denial-of-service-possibilities">Denial-of-Service Possibilities</h2><p>After testing other APIs, it seemed clear that only the WebSpeech API was making it through to the parent page. Things like <code>alert()</code> boxes were deferred from being visible until the page was actually loaded. But it also seemed clear that, while certain APIs were not available, JavaScript was running unrestricted. What happens if you do an infinite loop on the prerendered page?</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>while</span> (<span>true</span>) {
  <span>// Infinite loop
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Yep, you could “denial of service” the Google search results page from being displayed. This is not an attack on their servers, but rather you lock up the user’s browser so Google’s search results page cannot load.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/dos.png" loading="lazy" alt="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" title="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" width="600"><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service</span>
Preventing the Google search results page from even loading by infinite looping in the prerendered page.</figcaption></figure><p>I shared the live example and a locally reproducible example of the vulnerability to Google.</p><h2 id="googles-response">Google’s Response</h2><p>Google’s security team responded promptly and professionally within 24 hours and decided to award a monetary reward for the vulnerability. The Chrome team did not dual-award since Google had already awarded. The Chrome team, however, were responsible for fixing the issue. I was not able to share this bug for quite some time due to the nondisclosure terms of Google’s vulnerability program.</p><h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2><p>The bug report and discussion is now public and visible <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=520275">here</a>.</p><p>I was suprised at how long it took to resolve and how difficult the fix seemed to be. It proved very difficult to break this API out from being enabled in the prerender context. In fact, at one point, one of the developers mentioned: <em>“This is currently our oldest &gt;= Medium severity security bug."</em> It was not until 2019 that they finally closed the bug after prerendering support was completely dropped from Chrome, due to it causing headaches like this, and the proof-of-concept could no longer be reproduced.</p><p>So, it seems premature optimization like <code>rel="prerender"</code> being the root of all evil isn’t just true because you might spend time <a href="https://xkcd.com/1691/">optimizing something that isn’t worth it</a>, but also because it likely increases the complexity and surface area for serious security bugs.</p></div></div>]]>

The catastrophic destruction of WWII and the Battle of Berlin, which caused the population to plummet back to nearly its pre-Groß-Berlin level, also brought about the conditions that would keep the population low well into the following century. The crushing geopolitical gravity generated by Berlin’s position at the heart of the Cold War acted as a colossal reduction gear, stifling growth in both the Western and Eastern sectors of the city as each side threw all available resources into countering the advances of the other.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_131865"><div>

This cyclical progression informs both the subject matter and the overarching structure of <strong><em>Unfinished Metropolis</em></strong>, a monumental new 2-volume work from Berlin’s Dom Publishers. The book accompanies the exhibition of the same name (“Unvollendete Metropole”; info at end of article), and takes a many-faceted view of Berlin, starting with an examination of the newly-unified Groß-Berlin, a unification that only happened, unsurprisingly (and much like the BER Airport debacle of the 21st century) after decades of conflict and barely-there consensus. As the introduction points out, Greater Berlin has spent the majority of its existence outside of democratic rule:</p><p><em>Greater Berlin was not ruled by democratically elected governments for many years of its history. It was only governed democratically in the period from 1920 to 1933 and then again more recently since 1990. The Greater Berlin project has suffered many setbacks. The city is an incomplete project.</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_145993"><div>

In a remarkable cartoon that compresses the curvature of the earth from Rome through Dresden and Berlin and beyond, reminiscent of Saul Steinberg’s “View of the World from 9th Avenue”, it even cast the Axis of WWII phantasmagorically onto the curvature of the earth. More frequently, though, its perspective zooms <em>in</em> on a staggering array of Berlin neighborhoods and city centers (Berlin’s paradoxical nature as a city with numerous “centers” is a recurring theme in the book), from lasting “centers” like Alexanderplatz and Zoologischer Garten to outlying districts like Friedenau in the West and Marzahn in the East, as well as yet more microscopic examinations of plazas, parks, and even specific artworks.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_154562"><div>

While such a vast array of maps might seem overwhelming, their overall effect is, paradoxically, one of greater focus. The accumulation of so many varied views of the city leads to a surprisingly unified view of the whole, like a cubist painting or a musical composition with a repeating theme. Berlin has spent the past century proving itself to be one of the world’s most unmappable cities (from a conventional perspective), with monumental buildings constructed and razed to the ground within decades – and, in the case of the Stadtschloß, built up again. The city has seen whole neighborhoods built, destroyed, and rebuilt, streets changing names from decade to decade, and of course its 30-year stint as two divided cities.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h3><em>The accumulation of so many varied views of the city leads to a surprisingly unified view of the whole, like a cubist painting or a musical composition with a repeating theme</em></h3></blockquote><p>True to its cyclical take on Berlin’s history, the book favors a thematic progression over a chronological one, moving backwards and forwards in history, from the 1920s (and even earlier) right up to bleeding-edge current events like COVID-19, the new BER Airport, and the still-under-construction Tesla Gigafactory. While current mayor Michael Müller provides an introductory text, the true “host” of the book is <strong>Gustav Böß</strong>, mayor of Greater Berlin from 1921 to 1929. Böß possesses not only a far-reaching futurism – “Urban development should never be driven by current needs, but rather by how it will meet future needs” – but also a timeless weariness appropriate to anyone who has attempted to obtain a consensus in the cranky, contentious politics of Berlin. His words written in the 1920s resonate prophetically over the next century’s worth of maps, documents, and photographs, and introduce each major new thematic section, from Berlin’s rail network to its roads and streets to the issue of its numerous “centers”.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_150290"><div>

This companion volume documents the “International Urban Planning Competition for Berlin-Brandenburg 2070”, where competitors sought to present comprehensive visions for the next 50 years. The competition, as well as Volume Two itself, take an international view of city planning, looking abroad to other European capitals from London to Paris to Moscow. The text offers ample historical context for each city covered, ultimately highlighting the ways in which Berlin’s challenges are either different from – or, more frequently, surprisingly similar to – those of other cities.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_141204"><div>
