<h3>
  18 September 2020
</h3>


  <p>In a few months, I’ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I’m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn’t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to talk about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, a book written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, famously known as the <em>Gang of Four</em>. If you never read it: this is a fundamental programming book describing programming abstractions published in 1994. The date is essential here, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
<p>This book has recently been discussed by many, due to <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1306581616983183361">a recent tweet from Robert. C. Martin aka Uncle Bob</a>. Long story short, telling a massive audience that book X is great, and treating people who consider it outdated as “foolish” does not end well.</p>
<p>While I disagree with the tone here, I’d like to focus on the negative comments which followed, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the book is outdated</li>
<li>its concepts are outdated</li>
<li>its authors said it’s outdated</li>
<li>the book is only focused on mid-90s C++ developers</li>
<li>no one ever used the “flyweight” design pattern</li>
<li>the book is not even readable</li>
<li>its abstractions make code unreadable</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, let’s get back to 1994. I was two at the time. All Internet websites could probably fit on a floppy disk, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Rasmus Lerdorf was only starting to work on its <em>Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter</em> CGI C program, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin would only start their research project for a web search engine two years later. The biggest technology companies were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Xerox, which mostly sat behind the oil, car, and food industries. Programming existed, but it wasn’t the same field as we know it today. Tech companies were a few, and I assume a lot of programmers were working in other industries. Being a professional in this sector was arguably more difficult then, and knowledge was not as easily accessible as it is today. This book was published in a world where programming started to spread in many industries. It surely was a very good resource, to try to apply its concepts, and see what works and what doesn’t. The authors were literally inventing the field at the time: Erich Gamma, for instance, teamed up with Kent Beck to create the Java JUnit test framework just a few years later, which hugely helped to popularise testing.</p>
<p>My point is: let’s remind ourselves we stand on the shoulders of many people who tried and experimented a lot at the time. We too often take for granted the knowledge and productivity we have today. On top of that, let’s not be disrespectful towards the previous generation. My father and my grandfather both work(ed) as electricians: never did my father complain about his father’s tools or habits before him. He learned them and perfected them with modern knowledge.</p>
<p>Now about the book in itself. While I agree with people saying that some design patterns are too abstract, I strongly disagree with the ones saying the whole book is outdated. Should you develop in a OO language today, such as Java, C++, Python or Ruby, or even more notably, develop a framework or a tool <em>for</em> developers, I think this book is still highly relevant today.</p>
<p>Here are my top picks from the book and why I chose them.</p>
<p><strong>Builder:</strong> because in OOP, objects often hold too much data in them, you need to control how to instantiate them properly. Even with overloaded constructors, data validation at instantiation can become messy. Do you like your testing framework using a <em>fluent interface</em> with method chaining (<code>assert(...).not().equalTo(...)</code>)? Guess what, it’s directly inspired by the builder design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> I often hear people complaining about how complicated JavaScript is. While I don’t think this language makes it easy for the developer to write non error-prone code, I better understood the language via the lens of its prototype-based nature, precisely described by the prototype design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the structural patterns:</strong> While everyone is focused on the bad parts of OOP, namely inheritance, all those design patterns are focused on composability. If you want to be cool nowadays, you could say you prefer “composition over inheritance”. Well, if you think composition is only about embedding objects in each other, you should read the part of structural design patterns. For instance, you probably know decorators from Python or annotations in Java/C#, they derive from the decorator design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> I think we can all agree on how great it is to use and implement a middleware in our modern web framework. Just use or write functions which take a <em>next</em> handler, a request object. Pass it to your web framework instance via a <code>.use(...)</code> method and you’re done. This is what the Chain of Responsibility pattern is all about. All Rails, Django, and Laravel developers knew that was NIH.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator:</strong> This one seems obvious now, perhaps not so much at a time where iterating on arrays with pointer arithmetic was common. Today, iterators are even buried behind standard libraries to implement even higher abstract functionalities, but they are still there. I don’t see a more universal way to implement, with the same public API, a traversal of an array, a tree, or a graph (they are better ways of iterating those last data structures though).</p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong> For this last one, here is the verbatim definition from the book: “Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically”. Now, if we take a look at some modern technologies, doesn’t this resonate with PubSub models or React hooks for instance?</p>
<p>To conclude, I’m not saying the book is not old, quite the opposite: you can feel it when it takes as examples from 90s user interfaces. I’m merely advocating that our industry and its workers have changed a lot in the last 30 years, dare I say even more than in any other industry. But this should not be an excuse to sweep away years of meticulous R&amp;D and documentation, on which our modern tools still rely on nowadays, and the people behind it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people complained that they were never able to finish the book, here is an extract from the end, section “What to Expect from Design Patterns”, page 351:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to argue that this book hasn’t accomplished much. After all, it doesn’t present any algorithms or programming techniques that haven’t been used before. […] it just documents existing designs. You could conclude that it makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can’t offer much to an experienced object-oriented designer.</p>
<p>We hope you think differently. Cataloging design patterns is important. It gives us standard names and definitions for the techniques we use. If we don’t study design patterns in software, we won’t be able to improve them, and it’ll be harder to come up with new ones.</p>
<p>This book is only a start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="curl security headlines podcast" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/shcurl.png"></p><h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>

<p>In this episode of Security Headlines, we jump into curl with<br>
its founder and maintainer Daniel Stenberg.<br>
We talk security, CI systems, creation of curl, Fuzzing, IRC bots<br>
and a lot more!</p>

<p>Relax, Tune in and enjoy this episode of Security Headlines:</p>







<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/firo-solutions/episodes/Curl-special-with-Daniel-Stenberg-ejqn0g">https://anchor.fm/firo-solutions/episodes/Curl-special-with-Daniel-Stenberg-ejqn0g</a></p>

<p>Few software developers never even get near to having one<br>
of their projects being picked up by a larger community.</p>

<p>A project that started as a currency plugin to an IRC bot.<br>
Spun off and ended up becoming bigger and bigger resulting in being
adopted by over 10 billion devices.  Well, this project is called<br>
curl!  Curl is known to be the stable swizz army knife that can<br>
be used for making various types of transfer requests.</p>

<p>Need to download a file? Curl is here for you<br>
Need to test a socks5 proxy? Curl is here for you<br>
Need to download an ezine over Gopher? Curl is here for you<br>
Need to test a unix socket? Curl is here for you</p>

<p>In this episode of Security Headlines, we are joined by Daniel<br>
Stenberg who is the founder and maintainer of Curl.<br>
He has even been awarded a gold medal by the Swedish king for<br>
his work with Curl.</p>



<p><img alt="curl Daniel stenberg King medal" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/daniel-king.jpg"></p><p>The curl codebase is around 100 000 lines of C code, filled with<br>
hidden gems such as a libcurl code generator that creates a template<br>
based on the command line arguments you give it.</p>

<p>One of curl’s many features is the –libcurl option which<br>
takes the commmand you give curl and generate a C program that use<br>
libcurl with the same functionally, you can even port it to other<br>
programming languages with a similar syntax and use it with libcurl’s<br>
bindings.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl https://blog.firosolutions.com --libcurl example.c   
$ head example.c 
/********* Sample code generated by the curl command line tool **********
 * All curl_easy_setopt() options are documented at:
 * https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html
 ************************************************************************/
#include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  CURLcode ret;
  CURL *hnd;

</code></pre>

<p>Even Google love Curl, having curl in over 100 devices.<br>
This leads us to Google’s fuzzing project, where they have<br>
an army of computers that feed automated generated data in order<br>
to find bugs.<br>
This has resulted in curl being more stable, secure, and mature.</p>

<p>The world is always moving and so is the technology evolution.<br>
Getting a bit dystopian here, but maybe we will move to a future<br>
where we are running everything in a browser.<br>
A world where everything runs ipv6 and http3.</p>

<p>In that world, I know one tool we can count on.</p>

    <article>
      

<p>A journey through some of the reasonings and technical challenges that I had so far as a software developer at Misakey specialized in cryptography and security.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I Got Here</h2>
<p>I was recruited by Misakey shortly after its first fundraising (February 2019, €1M). The mission of Misakey was, and still is as of today, to provide an easy-to-use and highly secure way to connect people to the numerous accounts they have on other websites, as well as to connect people between each other. One key element of the solution was to encrypt user data in an <em>end-to-end</em> fashion, meaning that, while the data exchanged by users and websites would flow through our servers, it would be encrypted with a key that Misakey does not have. Doing so greatly increases the security of user’s data, but it adds a lot of technical challenges.</p>
<p><em>“Do not roll your own crypto”</em>: this adage is a reminder to software developers that cryptography is a very tricky discipline. Trying to build your own cryptography without a high degree of knowledge in this field is a sure way to introduce a security vulnerability in your product. Instead, you should rely entirely on third-party tools and services when it comes to cryptography, and you should avoid using them in a “creative” way.</p>
<p>At Misakey, we try to follow this principle as much as possible. For instance, we do TLS<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in the most standard, boring, uncreative way. But end-to-end encryption is still quite a “bleeding-edge” technology, and as a result you are not sure to find a tool that perfectly fits your needs. In this situation, there are two sane things to do: giving up, or investing massively in cryptographic expertise.</p>
<p>The founders of Misakey went for the second option. Unfortunately, professional software developers with a high expertise in cryptography are pretty rare. So they went for the opposite approach: they started looking for an expert in cryptography that would have decent skills in software development.</p>
<p>At that time, I had recently finished my PhD on cryptography and secure protocols after graduating as an engineer from <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/">Télécom Paris</a> and <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/fr">EURECOM</a>. Although I had never worked as a professional software developer, I had been programming as a hobbyist since the age of 15, and the engineering schools I graduated from are quite specialized in I.T. After a few discussions on the phone with the founders, I was hired. The deal was that I would progressively become a professional software developer in his own right by programming with the rest of the team, while using my knowledge of cryptography to design and implement the protocols Misakey needs. I also had some training in general cyber security (“hacking”, sort of), so I would be quite active on this topic as well<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="end-to-end-encryption">End-to-End Encryption</h2>
<p>End-to-end encryption is really booming these years. This is sometimes taking the form of what is called “client-side encryption” in some cloud-based services, like <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/en/cozy-cloud-how-to-encrypt-web-application/">what Cozy Cloud is doing</a> for instance, but the biggest trend is “encrypted chat applications”. <a href="https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/">WhatsApp conversations use end-to-end encryption by default since 2016</a>, and <a href="https://signal.org/blog/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger offers end-to-end encrypted conversations since more or less the same time</a>. <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is another popular chat application that offers end-to-end encryption, and there are a few other applications having a smaller market share, like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> (formerly known as “Riot”).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://about.misakey.com/cryptography/images/e2e.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Before the rise of end-to-end encryption, messages were already encrypted in chat applications, but only with the TLS protocol<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> that provides encryption from a device (a computer or a phone) to a server. In TLS, the device and the server negotiate an encryption key with each other so that they communicate securely, but because this key is known to the server, the server “sees“ the data. Most of the time this is perfectly fine because the data is actually intended for the server. For instance when you change your username in Misakey, the new user name is only encrypted with TLS. For most websites, TLS is (almost) all the cryptography that’s required to operate the service securely, and nowadays it’s quite simple for anyone to enable TLS on her website in a secure way thanks to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">CertBot</a>.</p>
<p>The situation is different in chat applications and in services like Misakey that simply act as intermediaries between users: the server is not one of the “ends” of the conversation anymore, it simply forwards data between users having a conversation. As a result, you cannot claim to provide “end-to-end encryption” simply because you are using TLS.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that a chat application using only TLS is “less secure” than a usual website. It means that we could aim at a higher level of security: if the server doesn’t <em>need</em> to see the data, we have an opportunity to protect the data from a hack of the server, and we do this by making the server <em>unable</em> to read the data.</p>
<p>It is tempting to ask: why not just use TLS from device to device, then? One reason is that TLS simply does not work from device to device: in TLS, servers do most of the work, so it is not trivial to recreate the same protocol with just devices. A second reason is that TLS will not give us some properties that we want for Misakey, like conversations between more than two devices and/or users. Of course, we will regularly see how things are done in the TLS protocol to better understand how to build our end-to-end encryption protocol, but it cannot be as simple as <em>“using TLS from device to device”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="existing-protocols-and-why-we-are-not-using-them">Existing Protocols and Why We Are Not Using Them</h2>
<p>The end-to-end encryption protocol used by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Signal is the “Signal Protocol” (because it was first developed by Signal, who then helped WhatsApp and Facebook integrate it in their own app) whose <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">specification and implementation are free open-source software</a>. This means that in theory we could use it to build Misakey, but in practice the Signal protocol is not really meant to be used as a stable platform for building other end-to-end encrypted products.</p>
<p>Element is a bit different from the other encrypted chat applications. The main goal of the people behind Element is to promote an entire <em>messaging protocol</em>, called <a href="https://matrix.org/">the <em>Matrix Protocol</em></a>, whose original purpose was to <em>“replace email”</em>. Element is simply a client for this protocol, but the developers want <a href="https://matrix.org/clients-matrix/">anyone to be able to implement their own client</a>, just like there are various programs to surf the Web or manage emails.</p>
<p>As a result, the Matrix protocol and the various parts of the Element application are designed to be usable as building blocks for other implementations and usage. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">the Matrix JS SDK</a> gives you a high-level interface to use the Matrix Protocol, including the end-to-end encryption part, without having to worry too much about the technical details of it: you enable end-to-end encryption in a chat room by calling <code>matrixClient.setRoomEncryption</code> with the ID of the chat room, and now all the messages sent to this room will be end-to-end encrypted, even if there are many people in it, each one using several devices. The Matrix team also provides a server for the Matrix Protocol, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>, which is very easy to use.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Misakey, the idea was to use the Matrix protocol as a communication platform to build our product. This way we did not have to implement end-to-end encryption ourselves, and we could enjoy a mature protocol and implementation which we would not have to maintain ourselves.</p>
<p>The Matrix protocol, and <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm">its end-to-end encryption protocol named “olm”</a>, are quite easy to use and to integrate in your own application … as long as the application you are trying to build is close enough to Element. Now Misakey is not exactly a “chat” application, its goal is mainly directed towards automated management of people’s accounts and data. As a result, we had some feature requirements that were quite far from what Matrix was designed for, like sending data to people that don’t have an account yet, or seamless device-to-device synchronization. Implementing them with Matrix would have required to somehow “bend” the protocol, using it in ways it was not designed for, and this seemed overly complicated.</p>
<p>There were also a few features we were missing from the Matrix JS SDK, mainly regarding key management in the olm protocol. We had no idea if we could push for their integration, and it seemed too much of a hassle to implement them in our own fork of Matrix. At some time <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/1167">we tried to contribute to the Matrix JS SDK</a>, but again this did not give us the speed we needed.</p>
<p>Maybe one day the Matrix protocol will become more versatile and we will be able to use it as a base for Misakey, but for now it seems faster to implement our own protocol, and to use Matrix as a source of inspiration. This lets us move faster, even if it is a great responsibility to implement end-to-end encryption from scratch. As we said, end-to-end encryption is a technology that is still quite “young”.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-trivial-end-to-end-encryption-protocol">The Most Trivial End-to-End Encryption Protocol</h2>
<p>It’s time to start building things. The quickest way of deploying end-to-end encryption between two users is to do the following: first, make the application of one user generate an encryption key. Then, tell this user to send the key to the other user through some other communication channel, typically email or some other chat application,or in person. This “other communication channel” must be secure enough. When the application of the other user receives the key, the applications of both users can use this key to encrypt data for each other.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://about.misakey.com/cryptography/images/basic-e2e.png" alt="chart illustrating basic end-to-end encryption with the key sent through an out-of-band channel"> 
</figure>

<p>Note that the key must <em>not</em> be sent through Misakey itself, otherwise it is not “end-to-end encryption” any more. This is why I speak of <em>another</em> communication channel. This is called an <em>out-of-band channel</em> in end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>Of course it is not ideal to have to assume that users <em>already</em> have this out-of-band channel to send cryptographic keys to each other in a secure manner. One could …</p></article></div></div>

    <h2>
      Stone MS-240x Typewriter (2): Hardware Design
    </h2> 
    
  </header>
  <!-- /.post-info -->
  <div>
    <p>In case you misseed it -- I talked about the backgrounds of the MS-240x typewriter in the <a href="https://tifan.net/blog/2020/09/09/revealing-a-forgotten-chinese-compute-history-stone-ms240x-chinese-typewritter-1-background/">previous article</a>. In this article, I'm going to discuss the hardware design of the legendary Stone MS-240x Chinese Typewriter (四通 MS-240x 中英文打字机) designed and sold in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Both the hardware and the BIOS was designed by ALPS Electric Co. ALPS provided a BIOS reference manual before the development began so that the developers in China could just write an emulator on the PC emulating the ALPS BIOS, and just focus on the development of the word processor.</p>
<div id="the-hardware">
<h2>The Hardware</h2>
<p><img alt="Stone MS-2401H 四通 MS-2401H 打字机" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401h.jpg"></p><p>(<a href="https://www.lty.me/stone-ms-2401h/">Picture taken by @lty1993</a>)</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous article, the hardware is just a 8088 machine in its core. In the 80s, the Japanese engineer reverse engineered and implemented Japanese counterparts of almost all popular chips in the west. The ALPS motherboard is not an exception to that.</p>
<p>I bought the machine on Xianyu (Chinese eBay equivalent) and shipped it to @lty1993 in China for examination, disassembly, and ROM dumps. The machine is quite heavy -- shipping it to the west coast would probably cost 200 USD. Guess there won't be any Stone Chinese Typewriters in the US for a while!</p>
</div>
<div id="processor-nec-v20">
<h2>Processor: NEC V20</h2>
<p>Instead of using the actual 8088 processor, MS-240x series used the NEC V20 running at different clock frequencies. The original MS-2400 clocks at 4.9125 MHz, the upgraded MS-2401 runs at 8 MHz, and the later MS-2401H model runs at 10 MHz.</p>
<p>The V20 is 30% faster than the original 8088 running at the same clock speed, providing additional power for the heavy lifting work a Chinese Typewriters needs to do.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory-hard-wired-memory-map-with-page-control">
<h2>Memory: Hard-wired Memory Map with Page Control</h2>
<p>The RAM itself is not interesting at all. It's just a bunch of Japanese made SRAM connected to the address bus of the processor.</p>
<p>The BIOS is mapped at <cite>0xF8000</cite> to <cite>0xFFFF</cite>, and CPU will execute the instruction at <cite>0xFFFF0</cite> -- that's the convention for 8088. So naturally, the BIOS was hard wired at that address.</p>
<p>Remember we talked about the Chinese fonts? It's a mask ROM, and it is quite large -- larger than the address space of 8088 processor if we include high precision Chinese fonts at 24x24 dot (which is still pretty awful in today's standard). To solve this problem, all external ROMs were divided into 32KB pages. To access any page in the ROM, you would send a command to the ASIC to select the page first (bank switching) before reading memory from the hard wired memory location. Sounds like a MMU? Well, this <em>is</em> a poor man's MMU.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting is that all models have built in battery backup units. Newer models (such as MS-2401) can even operate with battery with up to 3 hours battery life -- it almost makes the typewritter a laptop with a built-in printer.</p>
<p>Here's the memory map for various models of the Chinese typewriter.</p>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2400" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2400-memory-map.png"></p><p>MS-2400 have the Chinese font mapped at <cite>0xA0000</cite> with 16 pages in total. It can support up to 3 Chinese IMEs (input methods, such as Pinyin, Wubi or Cangjie) -- a standard IME comes with the machine, up to 2 additional IMEs can be purchased as a EPROM chip inserted in the expansion ROM socket. As there's only 1 IME socket, regardless of how many IMEs would you purchase, you'll always get just one 64KB EPROM. The keyboards are mapped at <cite>0x90000</cite> and have up to 3 pages in total.</p>
<p>When the machine was designed, there's also an expansion socket at <cite>0xE8000</cite>. However, the expansion socket was never used.</p>
<p>As the only display device is a 240x64 LCD, the VRAM is just 2KB in size mapped at <cite>0x80000</cite>.</p>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2401" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401-memory-map.png"></p><p>MS-2401 is significantly more capable with a bigger LCD display, larger RAM, and larger Chinese font ROM. To conserve mask ROM space, all font data in the mask ROM was compressed.</p>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2401H" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401h-memory-map.png"></p><p>You might wonder what does "V-RAM (CRT 用)" in MS-2401H/01C mean. MS-2401H/01C is the top of the line model in MS-2401 series featuring ability to attach an external monitor. The graphics chip is <cite>MGP TM6066A</cite>, a Hercules clone, with MDA output.</p>
</div>
<div id="system-devices">
<h2>System Devices</h2>
<p>We all know the 8088 is not a very capable machine. ALPS custom made a few ASICs to connect system devices such as printers, keyboards and LCD monitors to the system. That's also what makes it extremely hard to write an emulator -- without knowing exactly how the ASIC works, it's close to impossible to emulate all devices and peripherals. Even with the original designer's help, we still can't be quite sure what is the exact IO address for each device, let alone determining what each command would do.</p>
<p>But anyway, we do have an rough idea of what the system is doing.</p>
<div id="external-storage-device">
<h3>External Storage Device</h3>
<p>The first model, MS-2400, have an audio cassette connector running at 1200bps. Each cassette can hold around 500KB of data, or 250k Chinese characters.</p>
<p>In 1986, when 3 1/2 inch disk just came out, Mr Jizhi Wang chose to use the very new technology in MS-2401. This is a killer function at that time, because digital documents could be finally archived relatively cheaply. Of course you could always use a computer, but that's a big upfront investment.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyboard">
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2401" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401-keyboard.jpg"></p><p>It's not a ANSI keyboard. The design seems to be inspired by JIS keyboard, and was fully translated into Chinese -- you can't even find "Ctrl" on the keyboard, instead, you'll see "控制" (lit. control). This flattens learning curve for the typewriter, as it doesn't feel foreign to the users. Just like we say "it's all Chinese to me" -- the Chinese users would say "it's all English to me" -- because it really is!</p>
<p>One interesting fact to point out is instead of commonly seem Esc, Tab, Caps Lock, Shift, Ctrl arrangement on the left, the keyboard is actually 半/全 (half width / full width), Tab, Ctrl, Shift, 常用字 (frequently used characters). Of course, it's a Chinese typewriter, Caps Lock isn't that important after all.</p>
</div>
<div id="printer">
<h3>Printer</h3>
<p>It sees that the printer only accepts low level commands -- or shall we say, the printer itself does not have a controller. According to the reference manual, the printer head and motor are directly controlled by the ASIC. It also needs a few dedicated timers.</p>
</div>
<div id="asic-and-fdd-controller">
<h3>ASIC and FDD Controller</h3>
<p>In MS-2401H, there are 2 ASICs, each of them contains around 8000 gates. the model is uPD91260GD-5BD and uPD91261GD-5BB.</p>
<p>The floppy controller for MS-2401 MS-2401H is UPD72067GC.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The MS series machines are classical examples of pushing the hardware to its limits. Most people would simply say it's impossible to use a 8088-equivalent to drive a Chinese typewriter, but the engineers did it. By abusing the system and designing chips around the 8088, they were even able to map memory larger than the actual address space of the machine! Hats off to the hardworking engineers both in Stone Company and ALPS Electric.</p>
<p>Another thing to point out is Stone Company wrote fabulous documentations. It's really pleasing to read, contains a lot of technical details, and in some occasions, it teaches you electrical engineering! It even contained the layout of the diagnostics program so that you can just disassemble them and add new functionalities should you need them.</p>
<p><img alt="manga illustration in technical document" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-stone-documentation-manga.png"></p><p>Plus, the manga illustration is pretty cute. Haven't seen them for a long long time.</p>

<p>I've been developping an x86 bootloader in Rust that can use Linux boot protocol. In this article, I'd like to write about my motivation, features of this project, and issues. </p>
 
</section>
<section>
<h2>KRaBs - Kernel Reader and Booters</h2>
<p>KRaBs is a 4-stage chain loader for x86/x86_64 written in Rust.
<br>
 It can boot an ELF-formatted kernel placed on a FAT32 filesystem in the EFI System Partition. The ELF-formatted kernel is read from the filesystem and relocated, and then the kernel is booted. 
<br>
 It is all implemented in Rust. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/">GitHub - o8vm/krabs: An x86 bootloader written in Rust.</a> </p>
<p>It has the following features: </p>
<ol> <li> Currently, only legacy BIOS is supported.</li> <li> Both 64 bit and 32 bit system are supported.</li> <li> Both 64 bit long mode and 32 bit protected mode kernel are supported.</li> <li> GPT format partition table is supported.</li> <li> FAT32 file system support.</li> <li> The boot-time behavior can be controlled by CONFIG.TXT, which is placed on the FAT32 filesystem.</li> <li> Minimal x86/x86_64 Linux boot protocol is supported.</li> <li> kernel command line setting in CONFIG.TXT is supported.</li> <li> Some modules such as initramsfs/initrd are supported.</li> 10. The multi-boot specification is not supported. </ol> 
<p>An example of starting 64bit vmlinux with kernel command line and initrd is described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/blob/master/docs/linux-image-setup-64.md">this article</a>. </p>
<p>Just git clone the project and run a <code>cargo run</code> to experience after some preparation: </p>
<pre><code>
cargo run -- -we disk.img
</code></pre>

</section>
<section>
<h2>What motivated me to develop KRaBs?</h2>
<p>I thought that lower level programming below the OS stack could be also made more modern by using Rust. I wanted to extract the minimum essentials from the process of booting the Linux kernel and finally make up original bootloader where there is no black box for me.
<br>
 </p>
<p>In addition: </p>
<ul> <li>It's not easy for me to read the source code of an existing chain loader.</li> <li>Reading large amounts of assembly and C source code is tough for a beginner. It takes a lot of time and effort to read it. </li> <li>It is said that Rust binaries tend to be too big and not suitable for writing bootloaders, but I wondered if it is true.</li> </ul> 
<p>Based on the above, I've decided to write down the bootloader in Rust from scratch. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How KRaBs Works</h2>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Linux kernel bootstrapping mechanism</h3>
<p>While it may be difficult to unravel the Linux kernel bootstrapping mechanism from the bzImage and GRUB bootloader sources, The mechanism itself is surprisingly simple.
<br>
 There are four basic things: Loading the ELF-formatted image from the file system, Relocating it according to the program headers, and initializing system and setting parameters according to The Linux/x86 Boot Protocol. That's all there is to it. </p>
<p>Specifically, the following four types of initialization are performed: </p>
<p><strong>Hardware initialization:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Setting the keyboard repeat rate.</li> <li>Disable interrupts and mask all interrupt levels.</li> <li>Setting Interrupt descriptor (IDT) and segment descriptor (GDT). As a result,</li> all selectors (CS, DS, ES, FS, GS) refer to the 4 Gbyte flat linear address space. <li>Change the address bus to 32 bits (Enable A20 line).</li> <li>Transition to protected mode.</li> <li>If the target is ELF64, set the 4G boot pagetable and transition to long mode.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Software initialization:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Get system memory by BIOS call.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Information transmission to the kernel:</strong> </p><ul> <li>KRaBs mount the FAT32 EFI System Partition and Reading the CONFIG.TXT.</li> <li>Setting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/zero-page.html">Zero Page</a> of kernel parameters and transmit it to the OS.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Load items and Relocate the kernel:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Load kernel, initrd and command line according to CONFIG.TXT.</li> <li>The target is an ELF file, KRaBs do the ELF relocation.</li> </ul> 
<p>The format of CONFIG.TXT is a simple matrix-oriented text file that looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>
main.kernel sample-kernel
main.initrd sample-initrd
main.cmdlin sample command line clocksource=tsc net.ifnames=0
</code></pre>
<p>To perform the above process, KRaBs uses a program that is divided into four stages. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Stages Overview</h3>
<ol> <li> stage1  </li> A 446 byte program written to the boot sector. The segment registers(CS, DS, ES, SS) are set to <code>0x07C0</code>, and the stack pointer (ESP) is initialized to <code>0xFFF0</code>. After that, stage2 is loaded to address <code>0x07C0:0x0200</code>, and jumps to address <code>0x07C0:0x0206</code>. In the latter half of stage1, there is an area for storing the sector position and length (in units of 512 bytes) of the stage2 program. <li> stage2  </li> Load stage3 and stage4, then jump to stage3. The stage3 program is loaded at address <code>0x07C0:0x6000</code>, the stage4 is loaded at address <code>0x0003_0000</code> in the extended memory area. The file is read from the disk using a 2K byte track buffer from address <code>0x07C0:0xEE00</code>, and further transferred to an appropriate address using <code>INT 15h</code> BIOS Function <code>0x87h</code>. A mechanism similar to this function is used in stage 4. When the loading of stage3 and stage4 is completed, jump to address <code>0x07C0:0x6000</code>.  <li> stage3  </li> Do hardware and software initialization which need BIOS calls. After a series of initialization, empty_zero_page information is prepared in <code>0x07C0:0x0000</code> to <code>0x07C0:0x0FFF</code>. Enable the A20 line, change the address bus to 32 bits, and shift to the protect mode. Then, jump to the Stage4. <li> stage4  </li> Mount the FAT32 EFI System Partition. Then, read and parse the CONFIG.TXT on that partition. Load ELF kernel image, initrd, and kernel command line according to CONFIG.TXT. Drop to real mode when executing I/O. Set Command line and image informations in empty_zero_page. ELF kernel image is stored to the extended memory address <code>0x100000</code> or later, and then the ELF32/ELF64 file is parsed and loaded. If the target is ELF64, set the 4G boot pagetable and transition to long mode. Finally, jump to the entry point to launch the kernel. At this time, put the physical address (<code>0x00007C00</code>) of the empty_zero_page information prepared in the low-order memory into the <code>ESI</code> or <code>RSI</code> register. <li> plankton🦠  </li> library common to stage1 ~ stage4. </ol> 
</section>
<section>
<h3>How build KRaBs</h3>
<p>The directory structure of the KRaBs project is as follows: </p>
<pre><code>
$ cd /path/to
$ tree . -L 3
.
├── build.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── rust-toolchain
├── src
│   ├── bios
│   │   ├── plankton
│   │   ├── stage_1st
│   │   ├── stage_2nd
│   │   ├── stage_3rd
│   │   └── stage_4th
│   ├── main.rs
│   └── uefi
...
</code></pre>
<p>All four stages that make up the bootloader for the legacy BIOS and a library called plankton are stored as a sub crate under a directory named <code>src/bios</code>.
<br>
 Under the <code>src/uefi</code> directory, we plan to store UEFI-compatible bootloader crates.
<br>
 All these sub-crates will be built by <code>build.rs</code> at <code>cargo build</code> time.
<br>
 </p>
<p><code>src/main.rs</code> is not the main body of the bootloader, <code>src/main.rs</code> is the CLI program that places KRaBs on the disk. This <code>main.rs</code> will write each stage of the KRaBs to the appropriate location on the disk. The <code>-w</code> option is used to write the stages to disk. </p>
<p>With this directory structure, just run <code>cargo buil</code> to build the CLI and the boot loader, and <code>cargo run -- -w disk.img</code> to burn the boot loader to disk. You can also test it with qemu by running <code>cargo run -- -e disk</code>. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>DISK Structure</h3>
<p>KRaBs supports disks that are partitioned in GPT format.
<br>
 The BIOS Boot Partition and the EFI System Partition are required. Place stage1 in the boot sector and stage2 ~ stage4 boot code for legacy BIOS in the BIOS Boot Partition. Place the CONFIG.TXT, Linux kernel, initrd on the FAT32 file system of the EFI System Partition. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>
$ gdisk -l disk.img 
...
Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
Disk disk2.img: 204800 sectors, 100.0 MiB
Sector size (logical): 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): 2A1F86BB-74EA-47C5-923A-7A3BAF83B5DF
Partition table holds up to 128 entries
Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33
First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 204766
Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries
Total free space is 2014 sectors (1007.0 KiB)

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048            4095   1024.0 KiB  EF02  BIOS boot partition
   2            4096          106495   50.0 MiB    EF00  EFI system partition
   3          106496          204766   48.0 MiB    8300  Linux filesystem
</code></pre>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Why use EFI System Partition?</h3>
<p>The reason for this is to make this project compatible with the UEFI environment in the future.
<br>
 I didn't support UEFI from the start because: </p>
<ul> <li>This bootloader was originally intended to be used on older PCs, such as the ThinkPad 600X.</li> <li>Currently, Legacy BIOS support works in a wider range system than UEFI.</li> <li>It is mainly intended to be used in the cloud environment except my PC. Legacy BIOS is the mainstream in x86 cloud environment, and there seems to be no merit to replace it with UEFI.</li> </ul> 
</section>
<section>
<h2>Is Rust good for writing a bootloader?</h2>
<p>I know there are pros and cons, but for me, Rust has been so much easier and better than writing C and assemblies. Personally, I think Rust is also pretty good for low-level programming, like bootloaders. </p>
<ol> <li> It's a great relief when the compilation is completed without problems   </li> When something goes wrong, most of the time I only need to suspect the unsafe part. This has made debugging a lot easier. I'm an amateur programmer, but thanks in part to this, I was able to complete my first prototype in a week. <li> Rust's build system is the best  </li> In Rust, you don't have to wonder which object file to link with which, like in C. <li> I can use my C experience</li> Since the chain loader is a rocket structure, we always have to code the unsafe parts in order to move to the next stage, and I thought it would be nice to be able to use the same techniques I often use in C for the unsafe parts.  <li> I think even the low-level code in no_std can be written in a modern way.</li> </ol>

<h2>Issues</h2>
</section>
<section>
<h3>(RESOLVED) Setting Page Tables</h3>
<p>I tried to set up the page table with an alignment with a linker script or a struct attribute <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations">align</a>, but none of these things worked. It looked like the alignment settings were breaking other data structures. It's possible that I wasn't doing it right, but I didn't understand why and gave up debugging. In the end, I dealt with it by manually allocating the page table to the area where I wanted to set up. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/blob/master/src/bios/stage_4th/src/svm/lm.rs#L44-L69">This code:</a> </p>

In a world governed by a patriarchal system of marriage and inheritance, dependent on female purity to ensure any male offspring were legitimate, the ruined woman was literally damaged goods. Even the slightest whiff of a premarital dalliance could spell her undoing.</p><p>These old school ideas about women's worth have never entirely left us, resurfacing over the years in everything from the work of Andrea Dworkin to the abstinence wars of the late 1990s (when sex ed teachers would memorably compare girls who had sex before marriage to used pieces of Scotch tape). With dowries out of the picture, the idea that sex devalued women attached itself instead to America's sudden obsession with self-esteem. A young woman who had sex, particularly casual sex, clearly didn't respect herself. She was trying to fill an emotional void with cheap physical connection, and—yes—was making herself unmarriageable. <em>He won’t buy the cow,</em> we were told, <em>if he can get the milk for free.</em></p><p>Today, the notion that sexual contact is degrading to women has become wrapped up in the contemporary progressive language of trauma and consent. The damage in question is emotional, not material, but the paternalistic message is the same: innocent women must be protected. </p><p><em>Consent is sexy</em>, we are told, as sex-education pamphlets primly instruct us in the essentials of mid-coital conversation.<em> Do you like it when I touch you there? What do you want me to do to you? </em>Never mind that said literature studiously ignores the fact that for the young, inexperienced people at whom such instructions are directed, dirty talk by administrative mandate just adds a whole new layer of pressure to an already awkward situation: For all its protestations about how <em>hot </em>consent can be, the progressive discourse surrounding sex is markedly unsexy. Amid the obsession with power, oppression and the ever present threat of harm, the notion of desire (or, heaven forbid, <em>fun</em>) all but disappears. Even the most pornographic consent-is-sexy script is about risk mitigation, not titillation, an insurance waiver with a side of heavy breathing. </p><p>This laser-focus on consent effectively recasts sex itself as a dangerous act, to be undertaken with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary. And if relationships are mainly about power and the threat of abuse, those who pursue them too enthusiastically must be viewed with suspicion. More old-school gender stereotypes crop up here: men are increasingly seen as predators almost by default, while women are cast as helpless, even infantile. (Witness the rise of the word "grooming," previously reserved for sexual predation of children, as something done to women in their twenties.) As a breathtaking range of disappointing male behavior gets swept under the umbrella of MeToo, the line between pursuing a woman and preying on her has become blurred. When it was revealed that comic book writer Warren Ellis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/13/women-speak-out-about-warren-ellis-transmetropolitan">had relationships with multiple women at once</a>, the litany of harms included no sexual misconduct at all; instead, the women were "[shocked] at the sheer magnitude of his pursuits … heartbroken when he stopped talking to them, or angry after discovering he was sending many of them identical messages." </p><p>Shock, heartbreak, anger: these are normal things to feel when a romantic relationship goes sour. But today, they're lumped into the nefarious category of abuse by virtue of the purported power someone like Ellis—older, wealthier, more professionally successful, or otherwise more <em>privileged</em>—holds over his partners. By contrast, the notion that these were known and unavoidable risks of intimacy is dismissed as victim-blaming. As one of Ellis' accusers tweeted, "None of us consented to being manipulated." </p><p>This notion of consent as a safeguard against upsetting emotions is both new and counterintuitive: in most contexts (for instance, medical trials or media interviews), consent is sought precisely because what follows cannot be predicted, and may well be uncomfortable. But in certain progressive spaces, discomfort of any kind is taken to indicate the absence of consent, rendering countless normal human interactions suspicious. Turning someone down isn't comfortable, but neither is asking someone out. Even happy relationships involve moments of discomfort, disappointment, conflict—and even amicable breakups are rarely pain-free. Yet young people are now being taught to expect absolute emotional safety in sex, love and courtship at all times—and that if they feel hurt, disappointed or betrayed, it means they've been violated.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.persuasion.community/p/love-hurts-511?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/love-hurts-511?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><p>So how did we get here? Social conservatives say that hookup culture is to blame, and they're not wrong: traditional courtship, monogamy and marriage have their downsides, but they do give relationships a certain amount of structure and security. In the age of Tinder, those safeguards are comparatively hard to come by—and the elaborate (and sometimes ridiculous) bureaucracy of consent regulations may be best understood as a desperate attempt to impose some order on this wild west of sex and intimacy, spearheaded by people who are terrified of being vulnerable or getting hurt. There's a sense that relationships could be made unfailingly safe and comfortable, that disappointment and awkwardness wouldn't exist, if we only had enough <em>rules</em>. </p><p> Relationships have always been risky endeavors, but, ironically, this hypervigilance has made them seem outright terrifying. Every new romance is treated like a scavenger hunt for "red flags" that forewarn abuse, and every breakup is subject to adjudication via the #MeToo framework. Unhappy exes hash out their grievances on social media in a way that used to be reserved for divorced celebrities wrangling for the sympathy of the press. Private affairs are dragged into the spotlight for public reckoning and reparations. Men, already saddled with the pressure of making the first move, have to calculate the additional risk that an awkward overture or misread signal will result not just in rejection, but public humiliation and ruination. For all its valuable contributions to combating sexual harassment in the workplace, #MeToo has also made dating itself at once more fraught and less appealing—for everyone. If every relationship is a power struggle, in which the less privileged party is perpetually at risk of being victimized, why even bother? Who could possibly enjoy this? </p></div><p>This is not to demand a return to the rigid courtship norms of the Regency era—nor to the blinkered sex-positivity of the early aughts. Instead, we need to reintroduce basic notions of female empowerment and individual agency, and push back against the facile understanding of complex interpersonal relationships as power struggles between oppressed and oppressor. We should teach both young men <em>and</em> young women to recognize each other's vulnerability and humanity—even when a partner may hold more power than they do by certain measures—and to engage with their lovers as individuals, rather than as representatives of an identity group. And we should also teach young people to tolerate and work through discomfort, rather than seeing themselves as helplessly in thrall to power dynamics that leave them forever teetering on the precipice of victimhood. </p><p>When I wrote a teen advice column between 2009 and 2019, there was one question I received more often than any other: "How can I fall in love without getting hurt?" My answer was always the same: You can't! Intimacy requires vulnerability; the joy of human connection always comes with the risk of being hurt. But that risk is the same for everyone, no matter how privileged or blessed with institutional clout. Even the wealthiest, whitest, most cisheterosexual dudebro in the world can be absolutely wrecked by heartbreak—and even a person who sits at the intersectional nexus of multiple oppressed identity categories has the power to break someone's heart.</p><p>As much as trauma and abuse have replaced purity and marriageability on the landscape of moral panics, the same old fear is at work: that women's desires, left unchecked, will leave them in ruins. And while the impulse to protect young people from emotional pain may be well intentioned, the results are toxic. The obsessive focus on power as the driving mechanism in all relationships fuels a cycle of catastrophic thinking: women are ever more fearful of being mistreated, ever more convinced of their powerlessness to avoid it, and ever more sure that when it happens, they will be unable to handle it. And all the while, men, dehumanized by a framework that casts their desires as inherently predatory, are being taught to mistrust and infantilize women in the guise of respecting them.</p><p>We need to permanently banish the specter of the ruined woman from our understanding of heterosexual relationships. A healthy, sex-positive society acknowledges that unpredictability is a feature of dating, not a bug, and cannot be consent-scripted out of existence—particularly for inexperienced people, and especially when it comes to casual sex. Young people must be taught to be kind with and conscientious to each other, to respect boundaries, and to err on the side of caution in ambiguous situations—but they should also be taught that love and sex are rife with painful misunderstandings, and that even well-meaning people can hurt each other because they're insecure, confused or genuinely unsure about what they want. Instead of trying to keep them from ever feeling heartbreak, regret or shame, let's teach them that these things are always survivable, and sometimes even useful. Teach them to be gracious about rejection and charitable about missteps, knowing that they'll make mistakes …</p></div></div>

    <div><blockquote>
<p>How can we, as web professionals, help to make the web more energy efficient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From data centres to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions. According to recent estimates, the entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production, with data traffic doubling roughly every two years. It’s probably something very few people think about, or are even aware of as being an issue. But the fact of the matter is that the Internet consumes a huge amount of electricity. And when it comes to web design, there is a lot that can be done to make the web far more energy efficient.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>Creating a website is a lot more accessible today, made simpler by the emergence of no-code site builders. But it might be asking a lot for your typical web user or amateur creator to be aware of the environmental impact of their site. This, however, shouldn’t really be the case for any digital professional. Naturally, web developers will be more conscious of the weight of their pages, given that they are fully immersed in the code and content management that serves what you see on a web page. But even then, many developers simply look for the quickest route to completing a project, rather than the best way to produce the quickest and most efficient site. </p>
<p>So they load a website with bulky Javascript and third-party tools to meet the visual specification of the client or designer. As long as it works, right? They probably don’t care. They’re probably happy with their site that loads quickly on their 500Mbps connection. Who cares if they’re wasting expensive data on mobile connections in other countries? “But Carl, some of us don’t have the luxury of building super high-performance, lightweight, and optimised sites due to client budgets and deadlines.” Well, I think you need to work on your craft, change your attitude and your priorities, or find another profession.</p>
<p>When we talk about the energy efficiency of websites, it’s easy to assume that it’s a purely technical topic. However, efficiency can be improved before we even build a website. Design and content have a big impact on energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Therefore, some of the biggest contributors to heavy sites and large CO2 emissions, are <em>designers</em>. Large moving imagery, multiple web fonts, animation, sound, autoplaying video, and generally esoteric design is prevalent these days. We see showcase after showcase of the <em>best of the web</em>, where the only criteria is: “Does it look well-designed?” Well, look under the hood. It’s pretty terrifying. And that’s not even getting into the many accessibility concerns. If only more designers would ask themselves, “When was the last time I considered page size when designing something? When was the last time I decided that page weight was more important than aesthetics?” </p>
<p>These are questions I have put to designers before, and the response quite often is, “I’m just experimenting with technologies and trying to improve my UI skills. What harm is there in that?” Well, <em>Site of the Day</em>, the harm is your energy usage, and the likelihood that nobody—besides an echo chamber of fellow designers—give a shit about your over-design. People just want to access content quickly, without distraction, without friction, and without it using a tonne of data. That’s not to say aesthetics aren’t important—they certainly are. The visual design of a site can play a significant role in user experience, readability, and conversion, but as with most things, there is a balance to be achieved. And there is a responsibility to be shared.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a growing number of web professionals who do care about the impact sites have on the planet, and there are many solutions designers and developers alike can find to improve their sites without overly compromising their designs. Solutions that I am actively looking into to improve my own work.</p>
<p>So how can we be more energy efficient in web design? Well, the folks over at <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/">Wholegrain Digital</a> put together a comprehensive list, but here are some key considerations:</p>
<h3>Reduce Images</h3>
<p>The single largest contributors to page weight. The more images, the more data needs to be transferred and the more energy is used. A good starting point is to ask oneself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the image genuinely add value to the user?</li>
<li>Does it communicate useful information?</li>
<li>Could the same impact be achieved if the image was smaller?</li>
<li>Could we achieve the same effect with a vector graphic (or even CSS style) instead of a photo?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimise Images</h3>
<p>Some designs are focused almost entirely on imagery, in which case optimisation is vital to better performance. There are technical decisions that significantly affect the file size of images displayed on a page. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load images at the correct scale instead of relying on CSS to resize them, so that you avoid loading images that are larger than the scale they will be displayed at.</li>
<li>Use image optimisation tools before you upload them to your site. I personally use <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>.</li>
<li>Use the most efficient file format for each image, such as WebP instead of JPEG (although this is not supported by all browsers).</li>
<li>Use image processing tools to resize, crop, and enhance your images that are served. I use <a href="https://www.imgix.com/">imgimx</a> for this, which works well for image-heavy sites such as <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/">Minimalissimo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduce Video</h3>
<p>By far the most data intensive and processing intensive form of content. As with images, ask yourself if videos are really necessary. If they are, never autoplay a video. It creates a much higher load on the users CPU, resulting in vastly greater energy consumption. Plus, it’s annoying as hell. Let the user decide whether or not to play a video.</p>
<h3>Font Selection and Optimisation</h3>
<p>Web fonts can enhance the visual appeal of site designs, as well as improve readability, but they can add significant file weight to the sites on which they are used. A single font file could be as much as 250Kb, and that might only be for the standard weight. If you want bold, add another 250Kb! A couple of options worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use system fonts where possible.</li>
<li>Use fewer font variations.</li>
<li>Stick to modern web font file formats like WOFF and WOFF2.</li>
<li>Subset fonts to only include the characters needed on the site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Write Clean Code</h3>
<p>Tidy and streamlined code is a fundamentally good thing. Keep code clean and simple, avoid duplication, and write efficient queries. The code behind the scenes should be a well oiled, lean machine. And I’ll take this opportunity to share a controversial opinion: <em>all designers should learn to code.</em> At least if they want a website. No-code site builders can be very good, but if you’re not aware of the underlying code, then you’ll be less aware of ways to optimise your site.</p>
<h3>Use Less Javascript</h3>
<p>JS impacts website efficiency in two ways: by adding file weight to the web page and by increasing the amount of processing required by the user’s device. The second of these is something that applies to JS much more than to other types of files. Look for ways to achieve front-end interactions, functionality, and animations using more efficient technologies like CSS, or at least use JS efficiently. A particular mention should be given here to tracking and advertising scripts that rarely offer any value to the user, but can add significant file weight. Don’t let advertising get in the way of craftsmanship.</p>
<h3>Use Server Caching</h3>
<p>Using caching technologies such as <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> or <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> pre-generate static versions of each page so that the server overhead can be significantly reduced for most visitors. This significantly reduces server energy consumption and makes a big difference to page load times. </p>
<h3>SEO</h3>
<p>When optimising a site for search engines, we are helping people find the information they want quickly and easily. When SEO is successful, it results in people spending less time browsing the web looking for information, and visiting fewer pages that don’t meet their needs.</p>
<hr>
<p>No site is perfect, but appreciating that we have a responsibility to produce better digital design for the planet and for users is a good place to start. Web efficiency is an attitude and the result of a mindful approach to building for the web.</p>

Take the image above of Reed Hastings @ Netflix....</p><p>Reed Hastings has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/02/07-reed-hastings">said</a> <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/2009/01/27/news/newsmakers/hastings_netflix.fortune/index.html">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/2746816142?lang=en">times</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/12/netflix-6/">that</a> <a href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/reed-hastings/Reed-Hastings-Quotes.html">he got the</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/reed-hastings-innovator-year-81514">idea</a> for Netflix because he once was charged a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.</p><p>That didn’t actually happen. </p><p>It’s unfortunate because it will inevitably mislead anyone learning how to start a company. </p><h3>Sam Walton's Overnight Success</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e70c3fecf07561da8e7_grand_opening.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Sam was already 44(!) when he opened the first Walmart and had been running his own retail stores for over 15 years.</p><p>He wondered why people focused on the beginning of Walmart: </p><p><strong>Somehow over the years folks have gotten the impression that Walmart was something I dreamed up out of the blue as a middle-aged man, and that it was just this great idea that turned into an overnight success… </strong></p><p><strong>Like most overnight successes, it was about 20 years in the making.</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to build your own thing &amp; you want to learn from “the founder of Walmart”, looking at the start of the company itself is stupid because at that point he already had 15 years of experience</p><p>So let’s start with Sam’s very first store.</p><h3>The Biggest Mistake of&nbsp;Sam's Professional Life</h3><p>Sam started his retail career at 27 buying his 1st store, a “Ben Franklin” variety store franchise. </p><p>As a beginner he relied on the franchise’s playbook but also incorporated his own experiments. </p><p>Things like:</p><ul role="list"><li>putting popcorn &amp; ice cream machines in front of the store to drive traffic</li><li>doing huge discounts but actually making it up in volume (i.e. not ironically)</li><li>buying directly from manufactures instead of going through the franchise (which allowed for cheaper prices)</li></ul><p>He worked hard on that single store for 5 years, grew sales 3.5x to $250k/year and became the #1 Ben Franklin franchisee in his six-state region.</p><p>But then he found out he’d made a gigantic mistake.</p><p><strong><em>When he signed the store lease he didn’t include an option to renew it.</em></strong></p><p>The owner (a local department store competitor) saw his success &amp; refused to renew the lease at any price, thereby forcing Sam to shut down the store.</p><p>Imagine working on something for 5 years straight, becoming the best at it, and then having a single person end it all.</p><p>Sam was devastated:</p><p><strong><em>It was the lowpoint of my business life. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn’t believe it was happening to me… I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community – done everything right – and now I was being kicked out of town. It didn’t seem fair. I blamed myself for ever getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord.</em></strong></p><p>He was mad, but he accepted responsibility:</p><p><strong><em>I’ve always thought of problems as challenges, and this one wasn’t any different… I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time.</em></strong></p><p>If Facebook or Google change their algorithms you at least get to keep your old customer base and your business assets.</p><p>But with a retail store you have none of that. </p><p>And because of the structure of the town they couldn’t just open another store somewhere nearby.</p><p>The Waltons literally had to pack up their family of 6 and go find a new town.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e7090bddf371b5d9227_shadow_figures.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>If he’d wanted to Sam had plenty of reasons to sulk: they were starting all over in a <em>smaller</em> town (Bentonville) that also had its fair share of competition (3 other variety stores). </p><p><strong>But Sam said “it didn’t matter much because I had big plans.”</strong></p><h3>Unsexy Determination</h3><p>Sam spent the next 12 years in what I call <em>narrative limbo</em>.</p><p>It’s the crucial part of any “overnight success” that doesn’t get covered in the Successful Entrepreneur genre.</p><p>No one writes about all the random tangents and mistakes you make here.</p><p>Like, say, that time Sam tried to start a shopping mall 10 years too early and lost $25,000? </p><p>Or what about the time a tornado destroyed his best performing store? All he had to say was “we just rebuilt it and got back at it.”</p><p>This is important to know if you’re trying to learn from Sam, but it doesn’t fit into any narrative.</p><p>The lesson here is that there will be mistakes and problems on any path to success. As a recent book title says, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">those obstacles are the way itself.</a></p><p>A coworker said Sam excelled here because he woke up every day “determined to improve something”, and that he was</p><p><strong><em>less afraid of being wrong than anyone I’ve ever known…Once he sees he’s wrong, he just shakes it off and heads in another direction.</em></strong></p><p>You don’t get any of this from Reed Hastings when he talks about $40 late fees. You think “oh I need a great idea” when the reality is the idea is nothing and your psychology &amp; persistence is everything.</p><p>Eventually Sam got to 15 stores &amp; by 1960 was the largest independent variety store operator in the US, doing a a total of ~$12M (in 2018 dollars) in annual revenue.</p><h3>It Would Seem Obvious</h3><p>It was here that Sam finally saw the opportunity for much bigger discount stores and got to work on the 1st Walmart.</p><p>He was the most successful independent operator in the US &amp; had 15 years of experience in retail, surely it should have been easy for him to raise money from investors…?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Sam asked other store owners, entrepreneurs, competitors… basically everyone said no.</p><p>He got a measly 5% from his own brother &amp; a store manager and had to borrow the other 95% (signing their house and all their other stores as collateral).</p><p><strong><em>Even the great Sam Walton couldn’t find investors to start the 1st Walmart, on the back of a near-perfect record in retail.</em></strong></p><h3>The 1st Wal-Mart</h3><p>Finally, the point where most people look at to learn, is the end of our story.</p><p>The 1st Walmart was an ugly retail store (8-foot ceilings, concrete floor, wooden fixtures) but it worked because Walmart’s prices always beat competitors. </p><p>(Even the name “Walmart” was selected with customer prices in mind: it was cheaper to buy neon signs for 7 letters than the longer names Sam considered.)</p><p>And you think Sam cared 2 cents about what anyone else thought about his stores? </p><p>The New York Times doesn’t mention Sam or Walmart until 1969, 7 years after the 1st store opening, and he’s just one random quote in the back of the paper:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e7098a06f34c1f02247_south.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And the Walmart 1970 IPO got a <em>single</em> mention on page 44 of the Times:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e7072644e0be8fffc12_nyt_walton.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want to learn from entrepreneurs, look at the start not the finish.</p><p>This first appeared in my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com/">Sign up to receive it here.</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>These are my personal principles for building software. I hope to frequently update them as my views change. There can be
valid reasons for breaking them (they are <em>principles</em>, not <em>laws</em>), but in general I believe following
them works out well.</p>

<p>Most of them revolve around making the system simpler in some way. It’s
my belief that simpler systems are more reliable, easier and quicker to modify,
and generally easier to work with.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">Make Invalid States Unrepresentable</h2>

<p>I have put this first because I think it is one of the most important
and most powerful principles.</p>

<p>You may have heard this phrase in relation to designing your program’s types, but
the principle applies everywhere you represent data - for example database design.</p>

<p>Not only does this reduce the number of states
your system can be in (and thus make it simpler), but it reduces the
number of <em>invalid</em> states, which is even better! Your system does not
have to handle these states because they literally cannot be
represented in your program.</p>

<p>This is not just a minor convenience, it can drastically simplify your system and prevent
entire classes of bugs from occurring.</p>

<h2 id="data-consistency-makes-systems-simpler">Data Consistency Makes Systems Simpler</h2>

<p>Consistency enforces rules on your data, and so reduces the number
of states your system needs to handle. This follows on from the
“make invalid states unrepresentable” principle.</p>

<p>I am using consistency here in a very general sense: that your data
adheres to certain rules, and that it always obeys those rules
at every point in time. This definition is related to ACID consistency, and shouldn’t be confused with CAP consistency.</p>

<p>The rules can be any pretty much anything, for example, 
that your credit should never be able to go negative,
or that private posts should not be visible to others.
It is not restricted to foreign keys or unique indexes, although
they are also valid examples.</p>

<p>As well as your database, consistency may be enforced by your
application utilising ACID transactions. It is preferable to enforce
them at the database level, but this is not common practice for
anything more complex than simple checks for practical reasons.</p>

<p>Anything which restricts or compromises consistency results in complexity.
This leads to the following practical advice:</p>

<p>It is simpler to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fewer databases (ideally one)</li>
  <li>Normalised, less redundant data</li>
  <li>A ‘good’ database design (big topic)</li>
  <li>ACID transactions</li>
  <li>More data constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>It is more complex to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple databases</li>
  <li>Redundant or denormalised data</li>
  <li>A poor database design</li>
  <li>Fewer (or no) data constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are valid reasons to make your system more complex, and I don’t
intend complexity to be a dirty word, but see <a href="#measure-before-you-cut">“measure before you cut”</a>.</p>

<p>I consider this principle to be one of the most undervalued in
software engineering today. Consistency issues often go unrecognised.
Many problems, I daresay <em>most</em> problems,
are consistency issues at an essential level - data that does
not conform to some expectation.</p>

<p>See <a href="#appendix-a-inconsistency-results-in-complexity">the appendix</a> for an illustration of how inconsistency can cause complexity.</p>

<h2 id="design-data-first">Design “Data First”</h2>

<p>What is more likely to be around in 10 years: your code or your data?</p>

<p>Code can be thrown away and re-written, but this is rarely the case
with data.</p>

<p>Data is more important than code. The only purpose of code is to transform data.</p>

<p>When designing a new system, it’s best to start with your database and
your data structures and build your code on top of that. Consider
the constraints you can place on your data and enforce them, ideally
by the way your represent your data.</p>

<p>Code design flows naturally from data design. The simpler and more
consistent your data model is, the simpler your code will be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables,
and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables,
and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="measure-before-you-cut">Measure Before You Cut</h2>

<p>This is the most common mistake made by software developers.
It’s responsible for <em>many</em> self-inflicted problems.</p>

<p>The principle is that when you make a trade-off that has a complexity cost, ensure that
the need for the trade-off is backed by emprical evidence.</p>

<p>Common mistakes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trying to build a complex “scalable” system that scales to
a size you’ll never need.</li>
  <li>Making services as small as possible without considering
need or cost.</li>
  <li>Adding inconsistency or complexity for performance in a part
of the system that is not a performance bottleneck.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with the simplest, most correct system possible.</li>
  <li>Measure performance.</li>
  <li>Do not pay complexity costs or violate the other principles
until it solves an actual problem, not an imaginary one.</li>
  <li>Some optimisations can be made without measurement, because
they have very little or zero cost. For example, using the
correct data structures that support favourable performance
for the operations you want to perform.</li>
  <li>It’s true that sometimes experience alone can tell you if you’re making the
correct trade-off. It’s still better if you can prove it.</li>
  <li>When you have to choose, prefer correctness and simplicity over performance.</li>
  <li>In some cases correct and simple code is the best performing code!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time
worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times;
premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of
it) in programming.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="avoid-trading-local-simplicity-for-global-complexity">Avoid Trading Local Simplicity for Global Complexity</h2>

<p>i.e. avoid making a part of the system simpler in exchange for making
the system as a whole more complex.</p>

<p>This trade is usually not an even one. Chasing after local simplicity can
cause and order of magnitude increase in global complexity.</p>

<p>For example, smaller services can make those services simpler,
but the reduction in consistency and the need for more inter-process
communication makes the system much more complicated.</p>

<h2 id="recognise-intrinsic-complexity">Recognise Intrinsic Complexity</h2>

<p>Sometimes things are just complicated. You cannot make problems simpler than they are.</p>

<p>Any attempt to do so will ironically make your system more complex.</p>

<h2 id="fewer-technologies-result-in-simpler-systems">Fewer Technologies Result in Simpler Systems</h2>

<p>It is better to understand a few technologies deeply than many
technologies at a surface level. Fewer technologies mean fewer
things to learn, and less operational complexity.</p>

<h2 id="focus-your-learning-on-concepts-not-technologies">Focus Your Learning on Concepts, not Technologies</h2>

<p>Do not concern yourself too much with intricate details of the software you use - you
can always look them up. Learn the underlying fundamental concepts.</p>

<p>Technologies change, concepts are eternal. The concepts you learn will
be used in newer technologies, and you will be able to learn them much quicker.</p>

<p>For example, do not concern yourself so much with the surface level
details of React, Kubernetes, Haskell, Rust, etc.</p>

<p>Focus on learning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pure functional programming</li>
  <li>The relational model</li>
  <li>Formal methods</li>
  <li>Logic programming</li>
  <li>Algebraic data types</li>
  <li>Typeclasses (in general and specific ones)</li>
  <li>The borrow checker (affine/linear types)</li>
  <li>Dependant Types</li>
  <li>The Curry-Howard Isomorphism</li>
  <li>Macros</li>
  <li>Homoiconicity</li>
  <li>VirtualDOM</li>
  <li>Linear regression</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-consistency-is-important">Code Consistency is Important</h2>

<p>This is important for keeping the barrier to entry for understanding your code low.</p>

<p>Sometimes writing the consistent thing is more important than writing
the “correct” thing. If you want to change the way something works in
your codebase, change all instances of it.  Otherwise, try to stick
with it.</p>



<p>The more principles you have in common with your teammates, the better
you will work together, and the more you will enjoy working together.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-inconsistency-results-in-complexity">Appendix A: Inconsistency Results in Complexity</h2>

<p>This is the simplest example I can think of to illustrate this principle.
I hope it doesn’t require too much imagination to relate to realistic
problems.</p>

<p>Consider a database with two Boolean variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Your
application has a rule that <code>x = y</code>, and it can enforce this rule by
using a transaction to atomically change both variables.</p>

<p>If this rule is correctly enforced, your data can only be
in two states: <code>(x = True, y = True)</code> or <code>(x = False, y = False)</code>.</p>

<p>Writing the function ‘toggle’ with this rule in place is
straightforward. You atomically read one of the values and set both
values to the negation.</p>

<p>Now consider what happens if you split those variables into their own
databases and they can no longer be atomically changed together.</p>

<p>Because you can no longer consistently ensure that <code>x = y</code>, your data
can be in two more states: <code>(x = True, y = False)</code> or <code>(x = False, y = True)</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which value should you use if your system is in one of these states?</li>
  <li>What should your ‘toggle’ function do in one of these states?</li>
  <li>How do you ensure that both writes are successful when writing a new value?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no correct answers to these questions.</p>

<p>Of course, if we’d followed the <a href="#make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">“make invalid states unrepresentable”</a> principle
in the first place, there would only be one variable! :)</p>

		<p>18 September 2020</p><p>A Cryptologic Mystery</p>
	<p>Did a broken random number generator in Cuba help expose a Russian espionage network?</p>




	
<p>
I picked up the new book <em>Compromised</em> last week and was intrigued to discover that it may have shed some light on a small (and rather esoteric) cryptologic and espionage mystery that I've been puzzling over for about 15 years. <em>Compromised</em> is primarily a memoir of former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok's investigation into Russian operations in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, but this post is not a review of the book or concerned with that aspect of it.
</p><p>
Early in the book, as an almost throwaway bit of background color, Strzok discusses his work in Boston investigating the famous Russian "illegals" espionage network from 2000 until their arrest (and subsequent exchange with Russia) in 2010. "Illegals" are foreign agents operating abroad under false identities and without official or diplomatic cover. In this case, ten Russian illegals were living and working in the US under false Canadian and American identities. (The case inspired the recent TV series <em>The Americans</em>.)
</p><p>
Strzok was the case agent responsible for two of the suspects, Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova (posing as a Canadian couple under the aliases Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley). The author recounts watching from the street on Thursday evenings as Vavilova received encrypted shortwave "numbers" transmissions in their Cambridge, MA apartment.
</p><p>
Given that Bezrukov and Vaviloa were indeed, as the FBI suspected, Russian spies, it's not surprising that they were sent messages from headquarters using this method; numbers stations are part of time-honored espionage tradecraft for communicating with covert agents. But their capture may have illustrated how subtle errors can cause these systems to fail badly in practice, even when the cryptography itself is sound.
<br>
<a name="fold">&nbsp;</a></p><hr size="1"><p>
	

First, a bit of background. For at least the last sixty years, encrypted shortwave radio transmissions have been a standard method for sending messages to covert spies abroad. Shortwave radio has several attractive properties here. It covers long distances; it's possible for a single transmitter to get hemispheric or even global coverage. Shortwave radio receivers, while less common than they once were, are readily available commercially in almost every country and are not usually suspicious or alerting to possess. And while it's relatively easy to tell where a shortwave signal is coming from, their wide coverage area makes it very difficult to infer exactly who or where the intended recipients might be. Both the US (and its allies) and the Soviet Union (and its satellites) made extensive use of shortwave radio for communicating with spies during the cold war, and enigmatic "numbers" transmissions aimed at spies continue to this day.
</p><p>
The encryption method of choice used by numbers stations is called a "one time pad" (OTP) cipher. OTPs have unique advantages over other encryption methods. Used properly, they are <em>unconditionally</em> secure; no amount of computing power or ingenuity can "break" them without knowledge of the secret key. Also, they are almost deceptively low tech. It is possible to encrypt and decrypt OTP messages by hand with nothing more than paper and pencil and simple arithmetic. The disadvantage is that OTPs are cumbersome; you need a secret key as long as all the messages you will ever send, with no part of the key ever re-used for multiple messages. Typically, the key would be printed as a series of digits bound into a pad of paper, with each page removed after use; hence the name "one time pad". OTPs can be difficult in practice to use properly and are quite vulnerable if used improperly; more on that later.
</p><p>
The OTP messages sent to spies by shortwave radio typically consist of decimal digits broadcast in either a mechanically recorded voice or in morse code (more recently, digital transmissions are also used) on designated frequencies at designated times, usually in four or five digit groups (hence the term "numbers station"). After copying and verifying a header in the message, the agent would remove the corresponding page from their secret OTP codebook and add each key digit to each corresponding message digit using modulo-10 arithmetic (without carry). The resulting "plaintext" digits are then converted to text with a simple substitution encoding (e.g, A=01, B=02, etc., although other encodings are generally used). That's all there is to it. The security of the system depends entirely on the uniqueness and secrecy of the OTP codebook pad given to each agent.
</p><p>
To prevent "traffic analysis" that might reveal to an observer the number of active agents or the volume of messages sent to them, numbers stations typically operate on rigidly fixed schedules, sending messages at pre-determined times whether there is actually a message to be sent or not. When there is no traffic for a given timeslot, random dummy "fill" traffic is sent instead. The fill traffic should be indistinguishable to an outsider from real messages, thereby leaking nothing about how often or when the true messages are being sent. But more on this later.
</p><p>
None of this is by itself news. The existence of numbers stations has been publicly known (and tracked by hobbyists) since at least the 1960's, and OTPs are an elementary cryptographic technique known to every cryptographer. However, Strzok mentions two interesting details I'd not seen published previously and that may solve a mystery about one of the most well known numbers stations heard in North America.
</p><p>
First, <em>Compromised</em> reveals that the FBI found that during at least some of the time the illegals were under investigation, the Russian numbers intended for them were sent not by a transmitter in Russia (which might have difficulty being reliably received in the US), but relayed by the <em>Cuban</em> shortwave numbers station. This is perhaps a bit surprising, since the period in question (2000-2010) was well after the Soviet Union, the historic protector of Cuba's government, had ceased to exist.
</p><p>
The Cuban numbers station is somewhat legendary. It is a powerful station, operated by Cuba's intelligence directorate but co-located with Radio Habana's transmitters near Bauta, Cuba, and is easily received with even very modest equipment throughout the US. While its numbers transmissions have taken a variety of forms over the years, during the early 2000's it operated around the clock, transmitting in both voice and morse code. The station was (and remains) so powerful and widely heard that radio hobbyists quickly derived its hourly schedule. During this period, each scheduled hourly transmission consisted of a preamble followed by three messages, each made up entirely of a series of five digit groups (with by a brief period of silence separating the three messages). The three hourly messages would take a total of about 45 minutes, in either voice or morse code depending on the scheduled time and frequency. Every hour, the same thing, predictably right on schedule (with fill traffic presumably substituted for the slots during which there was no actual message).
</p><p>
If you want to hear what this sounded like, here's a recording I made on October 4, 2008 of one of the hourly voice transmissions, as received (static and all) in my Philadelphia apartment: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mattblaze.org/private/17435khz-200810041700.mp3"><tt>www.mattblaze.org/private/17435khz-200810041700.mp3</tt></a>. The transmission follows the standard Cuban numbers format of the time, starting with an "Atenćion" preamble listing three five-digit identifiers for the three messages that follow, and ending with "Final, Final". In this recording, the first of the three messages (64202) starts at 3:00, the second (65852) at 16:00, and the third (86321) at 29:00, with the "Final" signoff at the end. The transmissions are, to my cryptographic ear at least, both profoundly dull and yet also eerily riveting. 
</p><p>
And this is where the mystery I've been wondering about comes in. In 2007, I noticed an odd anomaly: some messages completely lacked the digit 9 ("nueve"). Most messages had, as they always did and as you'd expect with OTP ciphertext, a uniform distribution of the digits 0-9. But other messages, at random times, suddenly had no 9s at all. I wasn't the only (or the first) person to notice this; apparently the 9s started disappearing from messages some time around 2005.
</p><p>
This is, to say the least, very odd. The way OTPs work should produce a uniform distribution of all ten digits in the ciphertext. The odds of an entire message lacking 9s (or any other digit) are infinitesimal. And yet such messages were plainly being transmitted, and fairly often at that. In fact, in the recording of the 2008 transmission linked to above, you will notice that while the second and third messages use all ten digits, the first is completely devoid of 9s.
</p><p>
I remember concluding that the most likely, if still rather improbable, explanation was that the 9-less messages were dummy fill traffic and that the random number generator used to create the messages had a bug or developed a defect that prevented 9s from being included. This would be, to say the least, a very serious error, since it would allow a listener to easily distinguish fill traffic from real traffic, completely negating the benefit of having fill traffic in the first place. It would open the door to exactly the kind of traffic analysis that the system was carefully engineered to thwart. The 9-less messages went on for almost ten years. (If I were reporting this as an Internet vulnerability, I would dub it the "Nein Nines" attack; please forgive the linguistic muddle). But I was resigned to the likelihood that I would never know for sure.
</p><p>
And this brings us to the second observation from Strzok's book.
</p><p>
<em>Compromised</em> doesn't say anything about missing nueves, but he does mention that the FBI exploited a serious tradecraft error on the part of the sender: the FBI was able …</p></div></div></div>

                                    <p>Great question! A more detailed answer will make its way onto this page later on, but in summary: it gives back to users their legitimate right to enjoy a feature they paid for that TI unilaterally removed in the latest OS versions (allegedly for security reasons, but the bug that cheaters could in theory use was from TI and had nothing to do with ASM!)</p>

                                    <p>Delete the arTIfiCE appvar from the Memory menu (<tt>2nd</tt>+<tt>+</tt>). Depending on what you need to do, you may also want to delete any installed shell and trigger a RAM Reset as well (be sure to archive and/or backup your files first)</p>

                                    <p>Most probably not, considering arTIfiCE only executes a small piece of assembly code (which was previously possible in earlier OSes), and doesn't install anything persistent. Simply fully reset your calc and there will be no trace of it.</p>

                                    <p>arTIfiCE uses software bugs in the calculator's code to be able to execute assembly. A light "shell" is run allowing you to choose which program to launch. The source code may become available later on GitHub.</p>

                                    <p>Most likely, but many other bugs have been found that future versions of arTIfiCE may use :)</p>

                                    <p>No - arTIfiCE only restores functionality TI calculators had for dozens of years and removed in the latest OS. arTIfiCE is in no way a cheating tool, and cheating is not condoned here in any way.</p>

                                    <p>No - arTIfiCE resides in an "appvar" file (Application Variable, an 8xv file) and it will be deleted by the OS when going into Press-To-Test mode, just like most other appvars. You'll have to re-transfer+open it after your exam.</p>

                                    <p>No, or at least not directly: arTIfiCE only makes it possible for you to launch ASM programs, that's it. So you'd have to find a downgrade program for that (search for it on the usual websites).</p>

                                    <p>Sure, from the arTIfiCE shell, you can install another shell, for instance <a href="https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium/releases/latest" target="_blank">Cesium</a>, which can be opened more quickly (thus you get to launch your programs more easily).</p>

                                    <p>Alright... The underlying exploit has a codename. In fact, all the underlying exploits found so far have fun codenames. They'll be released in due time :D</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the more frequent questions I answer on StackOverflow is a variation of the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m doing XXX with a file, how can I know if the file exists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The variations include verify no one else has the file open, if the file is in use, the file is not writable, etc ‘. The answer to all of these questions is unfortunately the same. Simply put you can’t. The reason why is the fundamental nature of the file system prevents such predictive operations.</p>

<p>The file system is a resource with multiple levels of control that is shared between all users and processes in the system. The levels of control include but are not limited to file system and sharing permissions. At <strong>any</strong> point in time any entity on the computer may change a file system object or it’s controls in any number of ways. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file could be deleted</li>
  <li>A file could be created at place one previously did not exist</li>
  <li>Permissions could change on the file in such a way that the current process does not have access</li>
  <li>Another process could open the file in such a way that is not conducive to sharing</li>
  <li>The user remove the USB key containing the file</li>
  <li>The network connection to the mapped drive could get disconnected</li>
</ul>

<p>Or in short</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The file system is best viewed as a multi-threaded object over which you have no reliable synchronization capabilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many developers, and APIs for that matter, though treat the file system as though it’s a static resource and assume what’s true at one point in time will be true later. Essentially using the result of one operation to predict the success or failure of another. This ignores the possibility of the above actions interweaving in between calls. It leads to code which reads well but executes badly in scenarios where more than one entity is changing the file system.</p>

<p>These problems are best demonstrated by a quick sample. Lets keep it simple and take a stab at a question I’ve seen a few times. The challenge is to write a function which returns all of the text from a file if it exists and an empty string if it does not. To simplify this problem lets assume permissions are not an issue, paths are properly formatted, paths point to local drives and people aren’t randomly ripping out USB keys. Using the System.IO.File APIs we may construct the following solution.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>string</span> <span>ReadTextOrEmpty</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>File</span><span>.</span><span>Exists</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>ReadAllText</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>);</span> <span>// Bug!!!</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>String</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code reads great and at a glance looks correct but is actually fundamentally flawed. The reason why is the code changes depends on the call to File.Exist to be true for a large portion of the function. It’s being used to predict the success of the call to ReadAllText. However there is nothing stopping the file from being deleted in between these two calls. In that case the call to File.ReadAllText would throw a FileNotFoundException which is exactly what the API is trying to prevent!</p>

<p>This code is flawed because it’s attempting to use one piece of data to make a prediction about the future state of the file system. This is simply not possible with the way the file system is designed. It’s a shared resource with no reliable synchronization mechanism. File.Exists is much better named as File.ExistedInTheRecentPast (the name gets much worse if you consider the impact of permissions).</p>

<p>Knowing this, how could we write ReadTextOrEmpty in a reliable fashion’ Even though you can not make predictions on the file system the failures of operations is a finite set. So instead of attempting to predict successful conditions for the method, why not just execute the operation and deal with the consequences of failure?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>string</span> <span>ReadTextOrEmpty</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>ReadAllText</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>DirectoryNotFoundException</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>String</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>FileNotFoundException</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>String</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This implementation provides the original requested behavior. In the case the file exists, for the duration of the operation, it returns the text of the file and if not returns an empty string.</p>

<p>In general I find the above pattern is the best way to approach the file system. Do the operations you want and deal with the consequences of failure in the form of exceptions. To do anything else involves an unreliable prediction in which you still must handle the resulting exceptions.</p>

<p>If this is the case then why have File.Exist at all if the results can’t be trusted’ It depends on the level of reliability you want to achieve. In production programs I flag any File.Exist I find as a bug because reliability is a critical component. However you’ll see my personal powershell configuration scripts littered with calls to File.Exsit. Simply put because I’m a bit lazy in those scripts because critical reliability is not important when I’m updating my personal .vimrc file.</p>

Several days ago, they just launched their brand new and Free Delirium Expansion which concentrate on sending players off the grid to carve out a brand new section with passive skill and then encounter the worst nightmares over there and finally let players earn <a href="https://eznpc.com/poe-chaos-orb">PoE orbs</a>&nbsp;and Path of Exile Currency after finish this expansion successfully. Needless to say, a lot of unexpected things are certainly going on in this game. If you are now thinking of turning away from this game just because of the way it looks or the way it feels, then we recommend you to not do it! Cause, in fact, Path of Exile is a quite great ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game) that really deserves the praise and accolades it get from the online gaming community and now, here are five reasons for you to at least consider trying this out!</p>
<p>The very first one is: <strong>This Game Is Free To Play</strong></p>
<p>Who does not like Free Games? Even better, who does not like Free Games that are really excellent? Though Path of Exile offers some optional microtransactions (they have to earn money one way or the other after all), this game is totally free to download and play! Of course, it got off to a quite difficult start when the developer Grinding Gear Game (GGG) launched it firstly, but with tons of expansions, tweaks, and feedback from players, this game has improved drastically and now holds the torch as the best action role-playing video games to date. I have to admit that this game has set the standard that every other game of the same genre should follow!</p>
<p>The second one is: <strong>This Game Has Tons Of Content</strong></p>
<p>Here comes the question, if there's just one thing that Path of Exile is famous for, what would that be? For me, I might answer, that's the vast amount of content PoE has available. This game now has been successfully out for eight years, which means that it's packed full of great content. Though the developer Grinding Gear Games (GGG) has a reputation of sometimes rushing content (the Betrayal League is a great example of that) filled with glaring errors, the fact of the matter is you will be spoiled with so much stuff to do. And you have to admit that most of their expansions are top-notch, and you can sink your teeth into this endgame content easily for hours.</p>
<p>The third one is: <strong>This Game Has Awesome Developer Support</strong></p>
<p>The developer Grinding Gear Games (GGG) of Path of Exile, is always dedicated to continuously improving their game. They are always pushing for updates, from some minor patches every month to some big ones named Leagues. These Leagues give brand new methods to play this game, new loot to discover, and new skin to collect. If that's not enough to entice you into trying out Path of Exile, these Leagues come about 3-4 months! And the developer Grinding Gear Games (GGG) seems to want to ensure that their beloved game lasts forever, therefore, they consistently find unique methods to innovate upon what's have already there. Anyway, there's always something to look forward to!</p>
<p>The fourth one is: <strong>Guide Are Always Available In Path Of Exile</strong></p>
<p>Are you have trouble when choosing which melee equipment you need to use? Or maybe you are a little confused about the skill tree's use? You can find guides all over the Internet pretty easily, and that is mainly thanks to the tight-knit Path of Exile community! Wiki builds are abundant and new guides pop up almost every day. Whether it is a YouTube video to help you with power leveling or just in-depth written guides about all of the expansions, you should know there are plenty of guides to make your Exile in Wraeclast so much easier than before.</p>
<p>The community of Path of Exile is just insanely helpful, particularly to those new starters who are just figuring out this game. It's difficult to find fun games anymore as most are filled with toxicity (checking out League of Legends and DOTA 2). Here people will welcome you with just open arms, and if you are coming from games that are plagued with those toxic communities, then you will be taken aback by how nice everybody is on Path of Exile.</p>
<p>The fifth one is: <strong>This Is A Unique Game</strong></p>
<p>As you know, in most RPGs (Role-Playing Games), you just need to pick a class and the designate skill points to whichever stats you want to increase. Generally, you are just locked into a particular style of play. That is not the case in Path of Exile. Your skills and abilities are just linked to skill gems that are socketed into your very own gear, from your helmet to your boots. And now these gems will apply different abilities to your gear just depending on which you select. Path of Exile pushes players to personalize their own characters with the help of the massive skill tree and hundreds of gems to choose from. No role-playing game has ever implemented this kind of customization yet, making Path of Exile a quite unique experience unlike any other.</p>
<p>And above are our five reasons why you should start playing Path of Exile. Okay now, have we already convinced you to try and farm some rare items such as PoE orbs and <a href="https://eznpc.com/poe-currency">buy PoE currency online</a>&nbsp;for fun? If you are not, just post your comments down below and let us know why.</p>

<p>In the last three months, I have done more video post-production than I have done in the past 12 years. Surprisingly, in these years, nothing seems to have changed. Considering how much media is now machine analyzable content, such as audio and visual, I’m surprised there aren’t more patterns that make navigating and arranging video content faster. Beyond that, I’m surprised there isn’t more process for programmatically composing video in a polished complimentary way to the existing manual methods of arranging.</p>



<p>In 1918, when the video camera was created, if you filmed something and wanted to edit it, you took your footage, cut it and arranged it according to how you wanted it to look. Today, if you want to edit a video, you have to import the source assets into a specialty program (such as Adobe Premiere), and then manually view each item to watch/listen for the portion that you want. Once you have the sections of each imported asset, you have to manually arrange each item on a timeline. Of course a ton has changed, but the general workflow feels the same.</p>

<p>How did video production and editing not get its digital-first methods of creation? Computing power has skyrocketed. Access to storage is generally infinite. And our computers are networked around the world. How is it that the workflow of import, edit, and export take so long?</p>



<p>The consumerization of video editing has simplified certain elements by abstracting away seemingly important but complicated components, such as the linearity of time. Things like Tiktok seem to be the most dramatic shift in video creation, in that the workflow shifts from immediate review and reshooting of video. Over the years, the iMovies and such have moved timelines, from horizontal representation of elapsed time into general blocks of “scenes” or clips. The simplification through abstraction is important for the general consumer, but reduces the attention to detail. This creates an aesthetic of its own, which seems to be the result of the changing of tools. </p>



<p>Where are all the things I take for granted in developer tools, like autocomplete or class-method search, in the video equivalent? What is autocomplete look like in editing a video clip? Where are the repeatable “patterns” I can write once, and reuse everywhere? Why does each item on a video canvas seem to live in isolation from one another, with no awareness of other elements or an ability to interact with each other?</p>

<p>As someone who studied film and animation exclusively for multiple years, I’m generally surprised that the overall ways of producing content are largely the same as they have been 10 years ago, but also seemingly for the past 100.</p>



<p>I understand that the areas of complexity have become more niche, such as in VFX or multi-media. I have no direct experience with any complicated 3D rendering and I haven’t tried any visual editing for non-traditional video displays, so its a stretch to say film hasn’t changed at all. I haven’t touched the surface in new video innovation, but all considering, I wish some basic things were much easier.</p>



<p>For one, when it comes to visual layout, I would love something like the Figma “autolayout” functionality. If I have multiple items in a canvas, I’d like them to self-arrange based on some kind of box model. There should be a way to assign the equivalent of styles as “classes”, such as with CSS, and multiple text elements should be able to inherit/share padding/margin definitions. Things like flexbox and relative/absolute positioning would make visual templates significantly much easier and faster for developing fresh video content.</p>

<p>I would love to have a “smarter” timeline that can surface “cues” that I may want to hook into for visual changes. The cues could make use of machine analyzable features in the audio and video, based on features detected in the available content. This is filled with lots of hairy areas, and definitely sounds nicer than it might be in actuality. At a basic example, the timeline could look at audio or a transcript and know when a certain speaker is talking. There are already services, such as Descript, that make seamless use of speaker detection. That should find some expression in video editing software. Even if the software itself doesn’t detect this information, the metadata from other software should be made use of.</p>

<p>More advanced would be to know when certain exchanges between multiple people are a self-encompassed “point”. Identifying when a “exchange” takes place, or when a “question” is “answered”, would be useful for title slides or lower-thirds with complimentary text.</p>

<p>If there are multiple shots of the same take, it would be nice to have the clips note where the beginning and end based on lining up the audio. Reviewing content shouldn’t be done in a linear fashion if there are ways to distinguish content of video/audio clip and compare it to itself or other clips.</p>



<p>In line with “cues”, I would like to “search” my video in a much more comprehensive way. My iPhone photos app lets me search by faces or location. How about that in my video editor? All the video clips with a certain face or background?</p>



<p>Also, it would be nice to generate these “features” with some ease. I personally dont know what it would take to train a feature detector by viewing some parts of a clip, labeling it, and then using the labeled example to find the other instances of similar kinds of visual content. I do know its possible, and that would be very useful for speeding up the editing process.</p>



<p>In my use case, I’m seeing a lot of video recordings of Zoom calls or webinars. This is another example of video content that generally looks the “same” and could be analyzed for certain content types. I would be able to quickly navigate through clips if I could be able to filter video by when the video is a screen of many faces viewed at once, or when only one speaker is featured at a time. </p>



<p>All of this to say, there is a lot of gaps in the tools available at the moment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Many users of Python deprioritize performance in favor of soft benefits like ergonomics, business value, and simplicity. Users who prioritize performance typically end up on faster compiled languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>One group of users is left behind, though. The scientific computing community has lots of raw data they need to process, and would very much like performance. Yet, they struggle to move away from Python, because of network effects, and because Python’s beginner-friendliness is appealing to scientists for whom programming is not a first language. So, how can Python users achieve some fraction of the performance that their C++ and Java friends enjoy?</p>
<p>In practice, scientific computing users rely on the NumPy family of libraries e.g.&nbsp;NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CuPy, JAX, etc.. The sheer proliferation of these libraries suggests that the NumPy model is getting something right. In this essay, I’ll talk about what makes NumPy so effective, and where the next generation of Python numerical computing libraries (e.g.&nbsp;TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) seems to be headed.</p>
<h2 id="data-good-pointers-bad">Data good, pointers bad</h2>
<p>A pesky fact of computing is that computers can compute far faster than we can deliver data to compute on. In particular, data transfer <em>latency</em> is the Achille’s heel of data devices (both RAM and storage). Manufacturers disguise this weakness by emphasizing improvements in data transfer <em>throughput</em>, but latency continues to stagnate. Ultimately, this means that any chained data access patterns, where one data retrieval must be completed before the next may proceed, are the worst case for computers.</p>
<p>These worst-case chained data access patterns are unfortunately quite common – so common that they have a name you may be familiar with: a pointer.</p>
<p>Pointers have always been slow. In the ’80s and ’90s, our hard drives were essentially optimized record players, with a read head riding on top of a spinning platter. These hard drives had physical limitations: The disk could only spin so fast without shattering, and the read head was also mechanical, limiting its movement speed. Disk seeks were slow, and the programs that were most severely affected were databases. Some ways that databases dealt with these physical limitations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using binary trees (requiring <span>\(\log_2 N\)</span> disk seeks), B-trees with a much higher branching factor <span>\(k\)</span> were used, only requiring <span>\(\log_k N\)</span> disk seeks.</li>
<li>Indices were used to query data without having to read the full contents of each row.</li>
<li>Vertically-oriented databases optimized for read-heavy workloads (e.g.&nbsp;summary statistics over one field, across entire datasets), by reorganizing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA">arrays of structs to structs of arrays</a>. This maximized effective disk throughput, since no extraneous data was loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, compute speed is roughly <span>\(10^5 - 10^6\)</span> times faster than in 1990. Today, RAM is roughly <span>\(10^5\)</span> times faster than HDDs from 1990. I was amused and unsurprised to find that Raymond Hettinger’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg">excellent talk on the evolution of Python’s in-memory <code>dict</code> implementation</a> plays out like a brief history of early database design. Time, rather than healing things, has only worsened the compute-memory imbalance.</p>
<h2 id="numpys-optimizations">NumPy’s optimizations</h2>
<h3 id="boxing-costs">Boxing costs</h3>
<p>In many higher-level languages, raw data comes in boxes containing metadata and a pointer to the actual data. In Python, the PyObject box holds reference counts, so that the garbage collector can operate generically on all Python entities.</p>
<p>Boxing creates two sources of inefficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>The metadata bloats the data, reducing the data density of our expensive memory.</li>
<li>The pointer indirection creates another round trip of memory retrieval latency.</li>
</ul>
<p>A NumPy array can hold many raw data within a single PyObject box, <em>provided that all of those data are of the same type</em> (int32, float32, etc.). By doing this, NumPy amortizes the cost of boxing over multiple data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_dive_mcts">my previous investigations into Monte Carlo tree search</a>, a naive UCT implementation performed poorly because it instantiated millions of UCTNode objects whose sole purpose was to hold a handful of float32 values. In the optimized UCT implementation, these nodes were replaced with NumPy arrays, reducing memory usage by a factor of 30.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-lookup-function-dispatch-costs">Attribute lookup / function dispatch costs</h3>
<p>Python’s language design forces an unusually large amount of pointer chasing. I mentioned boxing as one layer of pointer indirection, but really it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Python has no problem handling the following code, even though each of these multiplications invokes a completely different implementation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mixed_list = [1, 1.0, 'foo', ('bar',)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for obj in mixed_list:
...     print(obj * 2)

2
2.0
'foofoo'
('bar', 'bar')</code></pre>
<p>Python accomplishes this with a minimum of two layers of pointer indirection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look up the type of the object.</li>
<li>Look up and execute the <code>__mul__</code> function from that type’s operation registry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional layers of pointer indirection may be required if the <code>__mul__</code> method is defined on a superclass: the chain of superclasses must be traversed, one pointer at a time, until an implementation is found.</p>
<p>Attribute lookup is similarly fraught; <code>@property</code>, <code>__getattr__</code>, and <code>__getattribute__</code> provide users with flexibility that incurs pointer chasing overhead with something as simple as executing <code>a.b</code>. Access patterns like <code>a.b.c.d</code> create exactly the chained data access patterns that are a worst-case for data retrieval latency.</p>
<p>To top it all off, merely <em>resolving</em> the object is expensive: there’s a stack of lexical scopes (local, nonlocal, then global) that are checked in order to find the variable name. Each check requires a dictionary lookup, another source of pointer indirection.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: “We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection… except for the problem of too many levels of indirection”. The NumPy family of libraries deals with this indirection, not by removing it, but again by sharing its cost over multiple data.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; homogenous_array = np.arange(5, dtype=np.float32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; multiply_by_two = homogenous_array * 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(multiply_by_two)
array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8.], dtype=float32)</code></pre>
<p>Sharing a single box for multiple data allows NumPy to retain the expressiveness of Python while minimizing the cost of the dynamism. As before, this works because of the additional constraint that all data in a NumPy array must have identical type.</p>
<h2 id="the-frontier-jit">The Frontier: JIT</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve seen that NumPy doesn’t solve any of Python’s fundamental problems when it comes to pointer overhead. Instead, it merely puts a bandaid on the problem by sharing those costs across multiple data. It’s a pretty successful strategy – in my hands (<a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/vectorized_pagerank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_dive_mcts">2</a>), I find that NumPy can typically achieve 30-60x speedups over pure Python solutions to dense numerical code. However, given that C code typically achieves <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/data_oriented_python/(https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gcc.html)">100-200x performance</a> over pure Python on dense numerical code (common in scientific computing), it would be nice if we could further reduce the Python overhead.</p>
<p>Tracing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JITs</a> promise to do exactly this. Roughly, the strategy is to trace the execution of the code and record the pointer chasing outcomes. Then, when you call the same code snippet, reuse the recorded outcomes! NumPy amortizes Python overhead over multiple data, and JIT amortizes Python overhead over multiple function calls.</p>
<p>(I should note that I’m most familiar with the tracing JITs used by TensorFlow and JAX. <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/">PyPy</a> and <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> are two alternate JIT implementations that have a longer history, but I don’t know enough about them to treat them fairly, so my apologies to readers.)</p>
<p>Tracing unlocks many wins typically reserved for compiled languages. For example, once you have the entire trace in one place, operations can be fused together (e.g., to make use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set">fused multiply-add instructions</a> common to most modern computers), memory layouts can be optimized, and so on. TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graph_optimization">Grappler</a> is one such implementation of this idea. Traces can also be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">walked backwards</a> to automatically compute derivatives. Traces can be compiled for different hardware configurations, so that the same Python code executes on CPU, GPU, and TPU. JAX can <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html#Auto-vectorization-with-vmap">autovectorize traces</a>, adding a batch dimension to all operations. Finally, a trace can be exported in a language-agnostic manner, allowing a program defined in Python to be executed in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Javascript</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving">C++</a>, or more.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a catch to all this. NumPy can amortize Python overhead over multiple data, but only if that data is the same type. JIT can amortize Python overhead over multiple function calls, but only if the function calls would have resulted in the same pointer chasing outcomes. Retracing the function to verify this would defeat the purpose of JIT, so instead, TensorFlow/JAX JIT uses array shape and dtype to guess at whether a trace is reusable. This heuristic is necessarily conservative, rules out otherwise legal programs, often requires unnecessarily specific shape information, and doesn’t make any guarantees against mischievous tinkering. Furthermore, data-dependent tracing is a known issue (<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html">1</a>, <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#python-control-flow-+-JIT">2</a>). I worked on <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/07/autograph-converts-python-into-tensorflow-graphs.html">AutoGraph</a>, a tool to address data-dependent tracing. Still, the engineering benefits of a shared tracing infrastructure are too good to pass up. I expect to see JIT-based systems flourish in the future and iron out their user experience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The NumPy API’s specifically addresses Python’s performance problems for the kinds of programs that scientific computing users want to write. It encourages users to write code in ways that minimize pointer overhead. Coincidentally, this way of writing code is a fruitful abstraction for tracing JITs targeting vastly parallel computing architectures like GPU and TPU. (Some people argue that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3321441">machine learning is stuck in a rut</a> due to this NumPy monoculture.) In any case, tracing JITs built on top of …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>This tutorial isn’t a basic setup how-to in a way you will learn how to install Arch Linux, neither is intended to replace the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">Installation Guide</a>, This is a guide for those who want a laptop with data-at-rest encryption and a verified boot process using SecureBoot.</p>
<p>I’ll not be arrogant saying that this setup is “tampering-proof” since this also depends on your firmware manufacturer, but I believe that this is a notebook setup with good enough security.</p>

<ul>
<li>Arch Linux setup overview.</li>
<li>Basic secureboot explanation.</li>
<li>Luks2+lvm setup for encrypted partitions at boot time.</li>
<li><code>/home</code> disk setup with crypttab.</li>
<li>EFISTUB to make Linux “it’s own bootloader” avoiding the entire <code>/boot</code> to be mounted on your ESP.</li>
</ul>

<p>UEFI is the new standard for boot and firmware management and it isn’t perfect, but is a natural answer to the old BIOS standard that has it’s limitations and is not aging well considering those limits and all workarounds involved to break them. You can find more information <a href="https://uefi.org/faq">here</a>. BIOS standard first appeared in IBM computers in 1976 and should (hopefully) die soon.</p>
<p>To keep words/concepts best alligned with what is correct, i’ll not call your basic computer program BIOS but firmware from now on during this reading.</p>
<p>I bought a laptop and wanted to encrypt all my data and thought: “Hey, i can do a full disk encryption but what if someone tamper my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record">MBR/Boot Sector</a>? So, using secureboot whas the best alternative (even with efi having a plain <code>FAT32</code> partition on it’s standard).</p>
<p>There’s a lot of drama around secureboot, most of it related to Microsoft and the way they demand deploying their keys on OEM vendor equipments. That doesn’t mean that secureboot is bad.</p>
<p>Pretty simple “explain like i’m five” secureboot concept: A Root of Trust combination with keys and certificates. Using SecureBoot your firmware will check if the operating system you are trying to boot and your bootloader are trusted by you. On each boot-up UEFI firmware will inspect what you are trying to boot and if it’s not trusted a security violation will be triggered.</p>
<p>There are four main EFI “variables” used to create a basic secureboot Root of Trust environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>PK: The Platform Key, the master one, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring">ring to rule them all</a>. The holder of a PK can install a new PK and update the KEK.</li>
<li>KEK: Key Exchange Key is a secondary key used to sign EFI executables directly or a key used to signd the db and dbx databases.</li>
<li>db: The signature databse is a list with all allowed signing certificates or criptografy hashes to allowed binaries. We will use THIS db key to sign our Linux Kernel.</li>
<li>dbx: The dark side of the db. Inverse db. “not-good-db”. You name it. It’s the list containing all keys that are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to highlight the following points of this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your signing keys are stored inside an encrypted disk.</li>
<li>Kernel signing will only happend after you have booted and running an already signed kernel.</li>
<li>Most notebooks today don’t have an exposed CMOS to keep configurations but instead they have nvram modules that will store firmware and configurations.
<ul>
<li>So, put a passord on your firmware to avoid secureboot being disabled.</li>
<li>Putting a password on your firmware will almost invalidate any chance of boot option change or secureboot disable.</li>
<li>In my case there is no “reset bios password” option and losing it will require contacting Lenovo to replace the main board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even with secureboot disabled, and attacker will not be able to decrypt your root partition without knowing your password</li>
<li>If you are worried about keys being accessed after booting, you have other issues to solve and disk encryption + secureboot will not be the answer.</li>
<li>Modern processors have <code>aes-ni</code> instuction that will help on disk decryption avoiding high cpu usage for this task.</li>
<li>Using a key to unlock luks <code>/home</code> partition is a way to increase convenience without sacrificing security. That key is stored inside another encrypted partition so, there is no much to worry about.</li>
<li>lvm inside a luks container gives you a lot of flexibility. This will also remove any visibility if someone steal you equipment since lvs will be inside one container.
<ul>
<li>Less error prone setup while manipulating <code>UUID</code>s is also an implicit feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, lets install ArchLinux, first boot it and create the Root of Trust of your notebook.</p>

<p>There’s a plenty of “efi how-tos” for Arch Linux on the internet, and some of the instructions here will be just an overview of what you dear reader will have to execute</p>
<p><strong>Step 01</strong>: Download Arch Linux <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">here</a> and write it to a pendrive using <code>dd bs=4M if=path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress oflag=sync</code> where<code>sdx</code> is your pendrive. If you are using Windows to create your bootable pendrive <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32 Disk Imager</a> will help you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 02</strong>: Configure your firmware to boot using UEFI, but keep secure boot disabled. Allow boot from usb and change it to be your first boot device. These instructions are pretty much vendor dependent and can change depending on your equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Step 03</strong>: Boot Arch Linux live usb, and after getting a shell change your keybord layout with the following command: <code>loadkeys br-abnt2</code></p>
<p>After that, connect to your wifi using <code>wifi-menu -o your_device</code>. There is an issue with the latest Arch Linux iso(06/2020) and <code>wifi-menu</code> is not working as expected. If you are using ethernet just ignore this step. Enable ntp sync with <code>timedatectl set-ntp true</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 04</strong>: Create <code>luks2</code> containers and <code>lvm2</code> volumes on the first disk. On my laptop i have 2 drives: <code>sda</code> is a ssd while <code>sdb</code> is a spinning disk. Use <code>cgdisk /dev/sda</code> and create a 256MB(i’m using 512MB but noticed that is way too much) partition for EFI (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition">ESP</a>) code <code>ef00</code> and the rest of your disk space create a partition with code <code>8309</code>(Linux Luks).</p>
<p>Create your luks container and open it. Default block cipher and block encyption mode should be good enough so there is no need of changing it with <code>-c</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>cryptsetup -y -v --use-random luksFormat /dev/sda2
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 crypt
</code></pre>
<p>Create your lvm infraesturucture on top of it. I’ll create swap and root logical volumes</p>
<pre><code>pvcreate /dev/mapper/crypt
vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/crypt
lvcreate --size 4G vg0 --name swap
lvcreate --size 30G vg0 --name root
</code></pre>
<p>Format your ESP, root and swap partitions/volumes</p>
<pre><code>mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg0-root
mkswap /dev/mapper/vg0-swap
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 05</strong> Now create a <code>luks2</code> container without lvm on it cause we will use the full disk just for <code>/home</code> and automatically map/mount it using <code>crypttab+fstab</code> here. Instead of typing a password 2 times during boot(one for root, another for home), we will just type the password for the root partition and host a key inside this encrypted partition to open the home luks container. Using a key to open a luks device has the same risks as typing a password and storing it into your ram. <code>cgdisk /dev/sdb</code> and create an all-disk partition using <code>8309</code> partition code.</p>
<pre><code>cryptsetup -y -v --use-random luksFormat /dev/sdb1
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 crypthome
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/crypthome
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 06</strong> Mount all and start to install:</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/mapper/vg0-root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/efi
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/efi
mount /dev/mapper/crypthome /mnt/home
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel vim efibootmgr linux linux-firmware lvm2 mkinitcpio networkmanager intel-ucode git
</code></pre>
<p>Do not install <code>intel-ucode</code> if you are using an AMD processor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 07</strong>: Create your <code>fstab</code> and change root to your new system</p>
<pre><code>genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
arch-chroot /mnt
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 08</strong>: Change your fstab <code>/home</code> mount point to use the device mapper name. If you try to mount it using <code>UUID</code> it will fail cause it needs to be decrypted first.</p>
<pre><code># /home
/dev/mapper/crypthome	/home     	ext4      	rw,relatime	0 2
</code></pre>
<p>Create a key to automatically open the home luks container. Change the “secretfolder” path example as you please.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /root/secretfolder
chmod 700 /root/secretfolder
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/root/secretfolder/crypto_keyfile.bin
</code></pre>
<p>Find the UUID of your home luks container(<code>sdb1</code> not <code>crypthome</code>) and add it to your <code>/etc/crypttab</code>. Crypttab columns are: mapping name(crypthome), luks partition UUID, key path and luks. You can check disks UUID by issuing <code>blkid /dev/yyy</code> where <code>yyy</code> could be a partition or a disk. In this case, use <code>sdb1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>crypthome UUID=29d3555d-cccc-yyyy-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx /root/secretfolder/crypto_keyfile.bin luks
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 09</strong>: Configure the rest of the system. Remember, this is just an overview of the Arch Linux installation and the focus here is on the secureboot aspect of this setup. In this step we will configure locale, localtime, keymap, hostname and user. I’m configuring a setup for a Brazilian Portuguese user so, change this info to reflect your language.</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Sao_Paulo /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
echo LANG=pt_BR.UTF-8 &gt; /etc/locale.conf
echo KEYMAP=bt-abnt2 &gt; /etc/vconsole.conf
echo hostname_i_want &gt; /etc/hostname
</code></pre>
<p>Uncomment the <code>pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8</code> line inside <code>/etc/locale.gen</code> and generate this localization with:</p>
<pre><code>locale-gen
</code></pre>
<p>Create a password for root, and the basic info for your user(change <code>myuser</code> to your login):</p>
<pre><code>passwd
useradm -m -g users -G wheel myuser
passwd myuser
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10</strong>: Edit your <code>mkinitcpio.conf</code> and include the <code>HOOKS</code> <code>keyboard</code>, <code>keymap</code>, <code>lvm2</code> and <code>resume</code>. Include <code>ext4</code> on <code>MODULES</code> and change <code>COMPRESSION</code> to <code>cat</code>. You can check my config file <a href="https://gitlab.com/nwildner/dotfiles/-/blob/master/etc/mkinitcpio.conf">here</a>. Recreate your initd:</p>
<pre><code>mkinitcpio -p linux
</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed the <code>i915</code> module on my <code>mkinitcpio.conf</code>. That’s how you avoid video flickering during the boot process if you are a user of an Intel Integrated graphics card.</p>
<p><strong>Step 11</strong>: Lets check if your motherboard is able to handle EFI entries using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>bootctl status| grep -i "sets"
       ✓ Boot loader sets ESP partition information
</code></pre>
<p>If this option is marked with <code>✓</code> you will be able to set boot information on your motherboard directly. Otherwise, you’ll have to rely on a bootloader like <code>systemd-boot</code>. You could obviously use the default EFI fallback option (<code>EFI/BOOT/BOOX64.EFI</code>) but the sofware we will use to automatically create …</p></div></div>

<p>Interviewing for a job often is a daunting experience. It may commonly be described as a two-way selection process, one in which the candidate is evaluating the company as much as the company is the candidate, but the sober truth is that outside of the most highly sought-after segments of the talent pool, the balance of power resides squarely with the hiring company and the candidate has little leverage until the moment a job offer is presented. This seemingly is especially true in Silicon Valley, where each job opening routinely attracts hundreds of applicants and it is not uncommon that the candidate simply never hears back from the company in the case the interview is deemed unsuccessful at any point along the process, without even a notice of rejection, let alone being provided an explanation or feedback of any kind. Basic decency and decorum can seem to fly out the window once the company makes the determination you are “not a fit,” which effectively translates to “henceforth a waste of time,” simply an undesired byproduct of an essential process, to be discarded as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>But every once in a while, as is the case with life in general, an exception comes along that runs against the grain of your learned expectations. It shows you the extraordinary does exist and offers a reminder that much of what happens in this world lies on a distribution, despite the seeming tyranny of what occupy the regions of central tendency. While it won’t negate the broadly observed norms, the reminder that excellence exists in almost all domains of human activity sometimes is enough to sustain one in a journey that is full of pitfalls and trials, providing the inspiration that helps keep alive hopes and aspirations even when the objective and dispassionate prognosis appears far from welcoming. Interviewing with Stripe, the payment startup, for me, was such an example.</p>



<p>My very first interview with Stripe started off quite inauspiciously. It was a phone interview with the recruiter, and after spending some time to explore and discuss both my background and that of the job, he let me know that my skill set probably was not as good a match for what the hiring team was looking for as initially thought. In retrospect that sort of upfront candor might have been an early indication of the caliber of the organization that was to be revealed more fully later on. But the remarkable thing that happened after he uttered that assessment was that he wanted to refer me to another recruiter, for a different role which he thought presented a better match. This was something that quite literally had never happened in my experience, admittedly a small sample as it may be – a recruiter that not only was well-versed enough in another position for which he was not recruiting, was empowered enough by the organization to make that kind of an autonomous referral decision without consultation, but also, probably most impressively, cared enough to take on such an initiative when I was deemed no longer useful for his immediate need, which was to fill the position at hand.</p>



<p>The subsequent interviews, for the new role, went more smoothly, uneventfully in the best sense. Over the course of the ensuing few weeks, in succession, I had a phone call with the new recruiter, a Zoom video call with the head of the business unit for the role (who was based overseas), a writing assignment, and in-person coffee shop chats in San Francisco with the said head of the business unit who happened to be in town that week and also with the hiring manager. All of that led to culminate in an on-site round of interviews with 7 individuals that lasted over 4 hours in January of this year at the San Francisco headquarters of Stripe.</p>



<p>In retrospect, it is clear I did not perform as well on the on-site interviews as I should have. What was unique about Stripe was the interview questions were actually provided in advance – the recruiter arranged a call with me prior to the scheduled date to go over the questions one by one. Gripped by the notion, somehow, that interviews are just conversations, however, I did not spend a lot of time preparing specific answers for those questions. Looking back, I now think a big part of the reason why was hubris; I have a tendency to think I enjoy all conversations, and proceeded to draw the conclusion in my mind that conversations I enjoy in an interview setting must be good interviews. The mere fact that I was ready to enjoy the interviews, in their natural, unscripted, conversational formulation, was, in a way, enough preparation. But once the on-site interviews began it became apparent the interviewers were pressing for a higher level of specificity in the answers than I was prepared to give in the courses of casual conversations. I could feel the inadequacy of my answers resulting from the lack of deeper considerations given them in advance, and I simply was not good enough to get to the level of detailed thoughtfulness on the spot. As I was ushered out of the building after the interviews concluded, I recall feeling a sense of regretful uneasiness creeping in. Almost compulsively, I remained hopeful, but far from confident. And surely enough, a few days later I was informed that I didn’t get the job. </p>



<p>I was devastated, but this is the point from which I was led to Stripe revealing itself to be a truly unique, unconventional company in the most unexpectedly wonderful ways. First, the recruiter offered to schedule a call so we could review the decision. I was pleasantly surprised to be given such an unusual opportunity, so I took him up on it. During the call he relayed some useful feedback, though it is clear in retrospect that I got too excited to be on such a call and spent way more time talking than listening to what he had to say. But importantly, the conversation helped me come to a realization, in concrete ways, that I was a much worse interviewee than had previously believed myself to be. It prompted me to ex-examine my natural tendencies in the ways I think, talk, and engage with others in conversations. When I shared the revelation with my wife, she was more than happy to supply additional pointers in areas of my failing.</p>



<p>The fact that the recruiter, and by extension the company, was willing to engage with and spend the time and effort on someone deemed to be “not wanted” was an enormous departure from everything I had experienced previously. Frankly, it was the kind of thoughtfulness and generosity of goodwill that I never expected any corporate entity to possess or display. I knew I had been rejected, but now I wanted Stripe even more, and I couldn’t let myself just give up. So I did something quite silly: I sent an email to the CEO. Fortunately Patrick Collison, Stripe’s CEO, lists his email address on his personal website. But I had no idea if the email would actually reach him, or if he would read it if it got to him, or if he would respond in any way. The overwhelmingly realistic outcome was that nothing would happen, and I knew it. It was a desperation move, one you are able to make only because you have nothing to lose.</p>



<p>Then, I got an email from the recruiter. He asked if I wanted to speak with the company’s chief risk officer – the job I interviewed for was a risk function – for reasons that were not entirely clear. He mentioned I might want “a bit more closure,” but I didn’t want closure; if anything, I wanted to keep the door ajar as much and as long as possible. He also said that the meeting was optional, with “no pressure.” Perplexed yet intrigued, I took up the opportunity to speak with the executive. She began the call with something to the effect of “I know you reached out to Patrick.” I had reached out to everyone I had interviewed with to solicit feedback, and since the name “Patrick” didn’t register right away I processed it to mean one of the interviewers. But about 5 seconds later I realized there was no one named Patrick that I had met, and then it hit me that it must be Patrick Collison, the CEO. My email to him was why this call was happening, which the chief risk officer confirmed when I asked her in disbelief. I was stunned. Having taken place almost a half year ago, much of the details of the call is a blur. But I recall distinctly her asking why Stripe should hire someone like myself. Most improbably, it seemed, this might be a second chance.</p>



<p>I had written to Patrick the CEO with a proposition: I offered myself to be a counterfactual data point in an evaluation of Stripe’s hiring process, after learning that Stripe’s credit card fraud detection system lets through some transactions which its algorithms flag as likely frauds in order to determine whether they turn out to be true positives or false positives – thereby evaluating the algorithms themselves – in a process called “counterfactual evaluation.” When the chief risk officer asked why I should be hired, I reiterated that proposition: the case I was making was not about my merits, but the willingness on Stripe’s part to apply counterfactual evaluation to its hiring process, to determine whether I was a false positive (incorrectly rejected) or a true positive (truly no good) by letting me join Stripe, without a bias to either outcome. I couldn’t tell if I was making any headway with the argument, but we soon ran out of time and she had to go to another meeting.</p>



<p>In the end, the outcome of my interviews did not change and I remain not an employee of Stripe. But out of all the job interview experiences I’ve had in my life, the one with Stripe stands out as singularly remarkable. When I shared my story with a friend she was so impressed that even though she wasn’t looking for a new job, she said she still might apply to Stripe just for the experience. Today Stripe has earned a reputation as one of the best embodiments of the ideals of Silicon Valley – a place of inventive and ambitious companies that not only come up …</p></div></div>

        <h3>(ATF)Â&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party's Central Committee have laid out a plan for a â€˜new eraâ€™ in which the party has better control over private business in China. </h3><p><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2020-09/15/c_1126497384.htm">The plan</a> was detailed in a 5,000-word statement â€“ and all regions and departments in the country have been told to follow the new guidelines.</p><p><span>This was the top story on Wednesday's CCTV Evening News â€“ how the president had issued â€œimportant instructionsâ€�.</span></p><p><span>It had a long-winded title: "Opinion on Strengthening the United Front Work of the Private Economy in the New Era".</span></p><p><span>The ultimate goal is for the party to have ideological leadership of private enterprise.</span></p><p><span>The statement seeks to improve CCP control over private enterprise and entrepreneurs through United Front Work â€œto better focus the wisdom and strengthen of the private businesspeople on the goal and mission to realise the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.â€�</span></p><p><span>Xi's instructions were issued ahead of a conference today on this very topic.Â&nbsp;</span>The party wants to see a "united front" between private enterprise and government business.</p><h3><figure><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" allowtransparency="true" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/459459469"></iframe></figure>100 ways to rein in the private sector</h3><p>Since the 18th National Congress in May, members of the party's Central Committee and Comrade Xi have proposed a series of new concepts and strategies, and adopted a series of major measures to guide and promote private economic 'united front' work. They say these moves have achieved "remarkable results". </p><p>As Chinaâ€™s private economy has grown and diversified, the statement says "these measures will bring about a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation under Xi Jinping thought".</p><p>Overall, there are more than 100 measures, including guidance on selection of personnel to implement the measures. </p><p>"We must also see that socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, [as] the scale of the private economy has continued to expand, risks and challenges have increased significantly, the values and interests of the private economy have become increasingly diverse, and the united front work of the private economy is facing new situations and tasks," the statement says.</p><p>"In order to thoroughly implement the major decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee, to further strengthen the Party's leadership of the private economic united front work, and to better integrate the wisdom and strength of private economic personnel to the goal and task of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the following opinions are hereby offered."</p><p>The primary stated significance of the measures is â€œenhancement of the partyâ€™s leadership over the private economy â€“ private economic figures are to be more closely united around the party.â€�</p><h3>More CCP involvement in business</h3><p>This is quite a turnaround. Previously, private business was not considered very worthy for party membership or influence, but it has gradually entered the heart of the regime.</p><p>According to the new provisions, private firms will need a certain amount of CCP registered employees, which is already a long-term practise in large private firms but not smaller ones. </p><p>These cadres will make sure businesses follow the guiding ideologyÂ&nbsp;â€œGuided by Xi Jinpingâ€™s Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.â€� </p><p>They will also guide private business people to enhance the latest CCP catchphrases â€“ â€œfour consciousnessesâ€�, strengthen the â€œfour self-confidencesâ€�, and achieve the â€œtwo safeguards.â€�</p><p>Duties of cadres will include the duties of strengthening ideological guidance,Â&nbsp;guiding private economic figures to increase their awareness of self-discipline, build a strong line of ideological and moral defence, strictly regulate their own words and deeds, cultivate a healthy lifestyle, and create a good public image.Â&nbsp;</p><p>They will also need to continuously improve law abidance and moral standards of private citizens.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Communication channels will be set up between private business and the party to report back on progress and other matters.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s ceremony on the White House lawn formalizing the normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, along with an agreement for Israel and Bahrain to do the same, marks the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The agreements do not create a new Middle East, as some have maintained, but cement that what had arrived haltingly and in fits and starts is here to stay. The Arab-Israeli conflict was already over in practice, and the Abraham Accord put a significant stamp on a process that had been underway for years. This does not lessen that it is something to be celebrated, and it should be clear to everyone without blinders on why Israelis are rightly happy. The Abraham Accord also brings with it another significant consequence, one that is perhaps unintended, in that the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict will put the focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in an unavoidable way.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Abraham Accord is a positive development for Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain, and nobody should pretend otherwise. Like nearly everything in foreign policy, it will bring some downsides along with it, but that doesn’t alter the cost-benefit analysis. It is a true Jared Kushner accomplishment, and credit should be given where credit is due. While Kushner and the Trump team’s vision for an “ultimate deal” when they took office was clearly intended to be one between Israelis and Palestinians, the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital without any reciprocal gesture toward the Palestinians and – crucially – the Palestinian reaction in the aftermath very obviously shifted their focus. Their vision ultimately became one of isolating and bypassing the Palestinians in order to craft agreements between Israel and Arab states and demonstrate to the Palestinians that they would not be able to exercise a veto over Israel’s place in the region writ large. Whether you agree with this approach or not – and previous administrations did not – the Trump administration succeeded in carrying it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;While the way to the agreement was paved by the UAE publicly setting forth that normalization could not coexist with annexation, the text of the agreement itself demonstrates how well the Trump administration managed to divorce the Palestinian issue from the wider regional context. The agreement does not explicitly mention the Arab Peace Initiative or the 1967 lines, does not mention annexation, does not mention two states, does not mention past UN agreements, does not mention the Palestinians themselves, and the only reference to the conflict is an open-ended commitment to “realize a negotiated solution to” it “that meets the legitimate needs and aspirations of both people, and to advance comprehensive Middle East peace, stability and prosperity.” For anyone looking to demonstrate to the Palestinians just how little they matter in this new reality, you could not come up with a clearer statement of just that.</p>



<p>&nbsp;That Israel and Arab states have been moving closer together for years due to a confluence of shared interests and a desire to benefit economically, militarily, and technologically does not mean that Kushner’s success was accidental. He was able to come up with the right set of incentives for the UAE to formalize what had been informal, and was also able to make the case that any concerns about breaking the Arab Peace Initiative approach – no normalization before an agreement with the Palestinians – would not carry any real consequences for states willing to do so. For all of the years of talk about secret relations underneath the table, things are now out in the open, and that is indeed a big deal.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But just as it is hollow to argue that the Israel-UAE deal does not matter, it is also hollow to argue that it is the only thing that matters. In the past few weeks, there has been a strange phenomenon of simultaneously embarking on a new path while turning back the clock. In the decades after Israel’s founding, its battles for survival and struggle for acceptance were collectively known as the Arab-Israeli conflict, which accurately reflected the primary threats and challenges that Israel faced. Following repeated Israeli military victories against Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and others, and the subsequent acknowledgement of Israeli military superiority and permanence in the region, the Arab-Israeli conflict transformed into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict remains, yet many this week want to pretend that we are back in Arab-Israeli conflict territory. Acting as if peace between Israel and Gulf states, and only peace between Israel and Gulf states, was the terminal goal all along is absurd. It does not detract from the actual accomplishment to describe it accurately and put it in the wider context, or to point out that this is an important and consequential deal but not the ultimate one that President Trump initially sought.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The fact that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is what remains means that there will be a true return to it in a more crystallized and concentrated way. For some, that will make it even easier to ignore, because left on its own and severed from the prospect of it being the gateway to normal relations with other states, it will seem even less important and relevant. For others, it will mean even greater awareness, as it will be easier to see all of the ways in which it is different from past Israeli conflicts and how it is not going to disappear one day on its own. Whether or not one wants to minimize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’s importance, it is far harder in the wake of the Israel-UAE accord – one that does not explicitly recognize Israel as a Jewish state but does explicitly recognize Jews’ place in the region and rebuts the charge that Israeli Jews are colonialist interlopers – to maintain the posture that “they will always hate Jews and never accept Israel” and thus no deal can ever be struck. And if you argue that there is something qualitatively different about the Palestinians, it is also harder to simultaneously insist that they are not a distinct nationality and that they should be satisfied going to one of twenty two other Arab countries.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Most saliently, leaving the Arab-Israeli conflict behind while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains will create an ever starker contrast between a situation where Israeli actions and control do not have a direct impact on the parties across the table – such as the Emiratis and the Bahrainis – and the glaring situation with the Palestinians, where they do. This is also a Trump administration accomplishment, albeit an unintended one. When Arab states that were not directly impacted by Israeli actions in the West Bank would not engage with Israel, it was easy to criticize and point out the unfair standard involved and lump everyone together. With the Palestinians standing alone in every way, not only in how they relate to Israel but in how Israel relates to them, it is going to be ever clearer why and how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not the same as the Arab-Israeli conflict, why and how it cannot be reduced to economic or security interests, and why and how the Palestinians are not going to be overcome by U.S. inducements or the promise of access to Israeli benefits quite so easily.</p>

				<p>Jerusalem, Israel – July 1, 2020 – <strong>BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: BVXV)</strong> today announced that all participants in the placebo-controlled, blinded, pivotal, clinical efficacy, Phase 3 trial of BiondVax’s M‑001 universal influenza vaccine candidate have now completed their site visits. In total, over 12,400 volunteers aged 50+ (with half aged 65+) were enrolled in the trial over the past two flu seasons in 83 sites across seven European countries. The purpose of the study is to assess M-001’s ability as a standalone non-adjuvanted vaccine to provide clinical protection from circulating influenza strains as measured by reduction of influenza illness rate (as a primary endpoint) and severity (as a secondary endpoint), as well as to assess M-001’s safety.</p>
<p>Seasonal influenza annually infects approximately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5596521/">10-20% of the world’s population</a> resulting in up to about <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal)">five million cases of severe illness and 650,000 deaths</a>. In addition, pandemic influenza, such as the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic of 2009, is a constant global threat. However, current influenza vaccines, which target frequently mutating parts of the flu virus and therefore must be updated annually in the hope they will match the next flu season’s circulating strains, achieve on average only about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm">40% vaccine effectiveness</a> in the general population and as low as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/2018-2019.html">12% in older adults</a>.</p>
<p>BiondVax’s M-001 is a single recombinant protein of highly conserved influenza epitopes. Consequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>M-001 does not need to be updated and therefore can be manufactured and distributed year-round.</li>
<li>M-001 is designed to provide protection to both existing and future seasonal A and B strains, as well as emerging pandemic strains.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.biondvax.com/about-us/management/tamar-ben-yedidia-cso/"><strong>Dr. Tamar Ben-Yedida</strong></a>, BiondVax’s Chief Scientist, commented, “<em>We are pleased that despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the challenge of conducting the trial across 83 sites and seven countries, thanks to all the people involved – including the CRO, investigators, and thousands of participants – we have maintained the planned timelines of our pivotal Phase 3 trial. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for improved influenza vaccines has arguably never been clearer. To better protect lives and economies, influenza vaccines must be more effective in reducing illness rates and severity. Needless to say, we are eagerly anticipating results of our trial by the end of this year.</em>”</p>
<p>Participants in the trial’s second cohort were enrolled prior to the 2019/20 flu season and monitored for influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms throughout the flu season. Swabs samples were collected from those participants with ILI, and influenza confirmation is currently being conducted by a qualified laboratory. Analysis will continue in the coming months, and results are expected by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>As part of this Phase 3 study, cell-mediated immunogenicity markers of M-001 will be evaluated in a subset of participants. The recently completed clinical study report (CSR) of a U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supported Phase 2 clinical trial of M-001 concluded that, “<em><a href="http://www.biondvax.com/2020/06/nih-report-on-phase-2-clinical-trial-of-biondvaxs-m-001-universal-influenza-vaccine-candidate-concludes-both-primary-endpoints-achieved/">M-001 induced significant polyfunctional T cell responses</a>.</em>”</p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing pivotal, clinical efficacy, Phase 3 trial, equipment installation and manufacturing process scale-up in BiondVax’s pilot facility in Jerusalem are in progress. The facility has planned annual capacity of up to between 10 and 20 million doses in bulk.</p>
<p><strong>About BiondVax </strong><br>
BiondVax (NASDAQ: BVXV) is a Phase 3 clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a universal flu vaccine. The vaccine candidate, called M-001, is designed to provide multi-strain and multi-season protection against current and future, seasonal and pandemic influenza. BiondVax’s proprietary technology utilizes a unique combination of conserved and common influenza virus peptides intended to stimulate both arms of the immune system for a cross-protecting and long-lasting effect. In a total of seven completed Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials enrolling 818 participants, the vaccine has been shown to be safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. The ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial aims to assess safety and effectiveness of M-001 in reducing flu illness and severity.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p><em>Try it online below or <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html">here</a>, and see <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/running.html">running.md</a> for more options.</em></p>

<p><strong>BQN</strong> is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays. However, because of its focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations, BQN should also be a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.</p>
<p>BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human-friendly <strong>infix notation</strong> with no precedence rules to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in array operations</strong> handle any number of dimensions easily.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/leading.html"><strong>leading axis model</strong></a>, which allows for simpler built-in functions.</li>
<li>Trains and combinators for <strong>tacit programming</strong>.</li>
<li>Lightweight <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/block.html"><strong>anonymous functions</strong></a> (like <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn">dfns</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/based.html"><strong>based array model</strong></a> makes non-arrays (called atoms) a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New <strong>array notation</strong> eliminates the gotchas of <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation">stranding</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html"><strong>context-free grammar</strong></a> where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.</li>
<li>Oh, and it naturally leads to <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/functional.html"><strong>first-class functions</strong></a>, a feature often missed in APL.</li>
<li>The <strong>new symbols</strong> for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-name-is-bqn">What kind of name is "BQN"?</h2>
<p>It's three letters, that happen to match the capitals in "Big Questions Notation". You can pronounce it "bacon", but are advised to avoid this unless there's puns.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-bqn-look-like">What does BQN look like?</h2>
<p>Rather strange, most likely:</p>
<a title="Open in the REPL" target="_blank" href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html#code=4oqRK2DiiJjijL3ijZ8xMuKGlTIgICMgVGhlIDEydGggRmlib25hY2NpIG51bWJlcg==&amp;run">â†—ï¸�</a><pre>    <span>âŠ‘+</span><span>`</span><span>âˆ˜</span><span>âŒ½</span><span>â�Ÿ</span><span>12</span><span>â†•</span><span>2</span>  144
</pre>
<p>For longer samples, you can <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/c.bqn">gaze into the abyss</a> that is the self-hosted compiler, or the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/r.bqn">shallower but wider abyss</a> of the runtime, or take a look at the friendlier <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/md.bqn">markdown processor</a> used to format and highlight documentation files. There are also <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/examples/fifty.bqn">some translations</a> from <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/">"A History of APL in 50 Functions"</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-work-with-the-character-set">How do I work with the character set?</h2>
<p>I enter the special characters using a backslash prefix, so that, for example, <code><span>\z</span></code> is translated to <code><span>â¥Š</span></code> (the backslash character itself is not used by BQN). The online REPL supports this method out of the box, and this repository also has <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/tree/master/editors">scripts</a> to support it, along with the standard syntax highlighting and indentation, in Vim and <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>. When starting out, it may be easier to use the bar above the REPL: hover over a character to see a short description, and click to insert it into the editor. Finally, on Linux <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/editors/bqn">this configuration file</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_keyboard_extension">XKB</a> can be used to allow typing glyphs with a modifier key system-wide.</p>
<p>Few existing monospace fonts support all the BQN characters (double-struck letters like <code><span>ð�•©</span></code> are a particular sticking point), which can cause these characters to be rendered with a fallback font and have the wrong width or look inconsistent. Two fonts modified to support BQN are available currently. This site uses a <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/docs/DejaVuBQNSansMono.ttf">modified DejaVu Sans Mono</a>, and another, more playful option is <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/BQN386">BQN386</a>, based on <a href="https://abrudz.github.io/APL386/">APL386</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h2>
<p>Read the <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/index.html">documentation</a>!</p>
<p>BQN documentation is currently written primarily for array programmers and is not comprehensive, with aspects of the language that are shared with APL poorly documented. If you're not an array programmer, it would probably be better to start with another language, or wait a few weeks. But if you're a serious language enthusiast, the <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/spec/index.html">specification</a> is fairly complete and might be enough to fill the gaps in the documentation.</p>
<p>If you're an array programmer, then you're in much better shape. However, you should be aware of two key differences between BQN and existing array languages beyond just the changes of <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/primitive.html">primitives</a>â€”if these differences don't seem important to you then you don't understand them! BQN's <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/based.html">based array model</a> is different from both a flat array model like J and a nested one like APL2, Dyalog, or GNU APL in that it has true non-array values (plain numbers and characters) that are different from depth-0 scalars. BQN also uses <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html">syntactic roles</a> rather than dynamic type to determine how values interact, that is, what's an argument or operand and so on. This system, along with lexical closures, means BQN fully supports Lisp-style <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/functional.html">functional programming</a>.</p>

<p>Some of these are things I wish I knew at the beginning of my journey so I could stress less.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>All tutorials are not created equal.</h2>
<p>Imagine yourself as a lab rat. </p>
<p>As you learn and experiment, pay attention to the kinds of tutorials that work for you. Many will not work. That’s fine. In fact, that’s exactly how experiments work until you find a solution.</p>
<p>But the moment you strike gold, stick to it, consume it voraciously and then find similar tutorials like that to continue rapid growth.</p>

<p>When I started, I used to bang my head against <em>Head First Java</em>, the book. But after studying for many hours, I just wasn’t getting anywhere. Yet, everyone online said it was the best book ever. But TheNewBoston youtube tutorials did it for me back then even though people don’t recommend him anymore.</p>
<p>I wish I could say this stopped after my 1st year. </p>
<p>Fast forward 2 years down the line when I started learning algorithms and ALL the blog tutorials I followed just didn’t make sense until I watched Youtube videos on Hungarian folk dance teaching algorithms.</p>
<p>And it just clicked. </p>
<p>Since then, my approach to learning has been to <strong>learn the same thing from multiple places</strong> until I find the instructor and style that works for me.</p>
<h2>Work within fear; not against it.</h2>
<p>I’ll admit: this one is easier said than done. </p>
<p>But you have to master this if you want to last long.</p>
<p>There’s this temptation to fix your fear first before you continue to learn. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>In fact, you’ll spend a lot of time trying to make your fear disappear that it’ll only double your anxiety. You have to find a way – your way – to acknowledge that you’re afraid, and frankly will continue to be afraid for a long time, then work within that realization. No need to fight it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this fear disappears as you become more proficient. </p>
<p>Other times, it vanishes for a while and comes back when you get into a new environment, work with smart people, or move to a completely new stack.</p>
<p>It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>This <em>IS</em> the life.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a sinusoidal wave – endlessly going up and down. Don’t take it too seriously or you’ll lose yourself.</p>
<h2>You’ll forget a lot of things.</h2>
<p>Deeply understanding this will change how you learn. </p>
<p>I can’t can’t the number of times I took <em>Introduction to Python Programming</em> on Udacity, Coursera, etc and still forgot everything.</p>
<p>It’s so annoying. </p>
<p>But I’ve since learned that you’ll forget anything you learn in isolated exercises because they are stored in short term memory. Neuroscience research shows that this is just how the brain works. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to forget, test your knowledge using spaced repetitions. To do this, build projects. </p>
<p>I’ll give you a concrete example: <em>len(myList)</em> will give you the length of a list in Python. You’ll learn this in Udacity’s intro course. </p>
<p>Come back a month later and you might not remember if it’s <em>len, length( ) or myList.size( )</em>. </p>
<p>But with spaced repetition through a project, the outcome is different. For example, you work on a 2-month long Django app for new coders where you need to count multiple times the number of users, the number of exercises done, the number of chats, etc. Imagine doing this throughout the span of the project, for two months. it’s hard to forget what len( ) does.</p>
<p>This is a trivial example, but hopefully you get the idea. </p>
<p>New learners can start with simple, isolated examples. </p>
<p>But <strong>if you’re not practicing within the scope of a project that makes you use and reuse what you’ve learned, nothing is going into your long term memory</strong>; it’s all short-term. And you’ll forget.</p>
<h2>Consistency &gt; hard work.</h2>
<p>Consistency is king. </p>
<p>When you start learning,  you lay down neural pathways that make it easier to retrieve information. According to Neuroscience research, these pathways only get strong through frequency of use, not just intensity.</p>
<p>This means 30 minutes a day, for 5 days a week is way better than 2.5 hours one day, only once a week. </p>
<p>Same hours; Different impact.</p>
<p>Don’t just work hard, apply wisdom here.</p>
<h2>Talent = hidden practice.</h2>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss progress as talent.</p>
<p>My first programming class was in C++ and my classmates refused to believe I had never coded before because I was just-so-talented. </p>
<p>But what they also refused to accept was that right after class, I would spend five hours typing <em>cout &lt;&lt; “this is my first program”</em>, realize it didn’t run because I forgot a semicolon; retype it and realize it didn’t print out my statement on a new line because I didn’t add endl.</p>
<p> This deliberate practice built perceived talent.</p>
<p><strong>Talent is sexier than hustle</strong> so no one wants to hear that you worked hard and got here. Just tell me you were born this way - it’s more believable.</p>
<p>But becoming a proficient developer is like playing an instrument. </p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Talent vs. Hustle - The majority of us mostly hustle our way through it.</em></p>
<p>Only a tiny few are born talented. </p>
<p>The majority can only get as good as the amount of practice they put in. And you can immediately tell a student hasn’t been practicing the moment they sit at the keyboard.</p>
<h2>You’ll meet a**holes!</h2>
<p>Every field has its dose of horrible people. </p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure what it is about software dev that attracts a**holes in droves. Maybe because coding gives the feeling of having a super-power or a rare skill. If you’re a newbie, you’ll meet those who’ve been coding for years and think no one else should come in.</p>
<p>A windows developer only? You’ll meet linux fanatics that think you’re mediocre. </p>
<p>If you’re a woman, you’ll immediately be dismissed because of your gender. I know this from personal stories from colleagues over the years.</p>
<p>If you’re a minority, you’ll meet people who think you should only fetch coffee; not code. </p>
<p>If you’re coming from another field (particularly not STEM), you’ll meet people who automatically make themselves gatekeepers of the programming community. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We don’t want social scientists here; we’re purists!”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re online. </p>
<p>At work. </p>
<p>And sadly sometimes in your family. </p>
<p>It’s not <em>if</em> you’ll meet them, it’s <em>when</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to move on.</strong></p>
<p>Things are getting better but there’s still a lot to do to educate people. </p>
<p>But don’t let this deter you. Build your resilience so you don’t quit after you meet these people. </p>
<p>And when you get to the top don’t be an a**hole!</p>
<h2>Master 1 thing.</h2>
<p>New devs tend to jump around learning a lot of things. </p>
<p>Okay, it’s not just new devs; it’s also experienced folks. </p>
<p>You learned React for one week.</p>
<p>Then Django for two weeks.</p>
<p>Laravel for three. </p>
<p><strong>Stop.</strong></p>
<p>You need to wake up and realize that the harsh truth is that you’re simply extending the time it’ll take you to truly learn anything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If one is a master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.”</em> - Vincent Van Gogh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pick one thing. </p>
<p>Stick with it for a few months – ideally 6 to 12 months before you move to something else. </p>
<p>This has two benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll go deep enough and hit critical mass that moves you towards mastery.</li>
<li>After you master one domain, you can transfer knowledge to another. Learn Flask and you can easily walk into Django. Learn React deeply, and you can quickly identify the pros and cons of Laravel within a few days. </li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t mean learn HTML alone for six months then only CSS for 1 year; rather, it means don’t mix up learning Django, with React, with Gaming Development, and iOS. </p>
<p>You might get a lot done in a short time.</p>
<p>But you’ll master nothing!</p>
<h2>Software dev is an ever evolving field.</h2>
<p>It’s exciting.
It’s frustrating.
It’s intimidating.</p>
<p>But if I had to, I’d do it all over again.</p>
<h2>Thanks for reading.</h2>

<p>I’m trying out a new initiative to help new coders and junior devs feel less overwhelmed, manage imposter syndrome and learn smarter. </p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not sure what this looks like yet. But I’m putting together some resources and write-ups based on what people need the most help with. </p>

September 17, 2020 | https://serhack.me/articles/what-is-stealth-address-technology-monero/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serhack.me/articles/what-is-stealth-address-technology-monero/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/stealthaddress/0_header_800px.png" alt="Monero Stealth Address"></p><p><a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> is based on the CryptoNote protocol and utilizes the most powerful cryptographic techniques in an effort to protect the privacy of the sender, recipient, and obfuscate the amount transacted.</p><p>To protect the sender’s privacy, Ring Signatures has been implemented to prevent transaction inputs from being distinguishable from one another. Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), which hides transaction amounts, was implemented in block <a href="https://xmrchain.net/block/1220516">#1220516</a> during January 2017 and since September 2017, this feature became mandatory for all transactions on the Monero network. In addition to these two key cryptographic techniques that Monero utilizes to ensure the privacy of every Monero user during the transaction process, Stealth Addresses ensure the privacy of the recipient. This article will focus on how Stealth Addresses work, why they were introduced, and discuss some details not commonly known about this essential feature of Monero.</p><p>Let’s imagine that you have to buy a product on an e-commerce platform from a merchant. The payment system will return a public address, so that the payment can be sent to the merchant. In the case where you use a transparent blockchain, such as <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> or <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a>, the link between your address and the address of the merchant is obvious. So, on transparent blockchains, a third-party from outside of the transaction has the potential to track how and where your funds are spent.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/stealthaddress/1_bitcoin_800px.png" alt="Bitcoin Transparent Ledger"></p><p>Thanks to Ring Signatures and RingCT, your privacy as the sender is protected and the transaction amount is unknown. To further prevent any potential transaction analysis and, more importantly, to ensure the privacy of the recipient (or, simply put, how and where you spend your funds), Monero uses Stealth Addresses.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/stealthaddress/2_monero_800px.png" alt="Hidden connection between Stealth Address and Wallet"></p><p>A Stealth Address is an automatically generated, one-time public key (otherwise known as a random, one-time address) that is created by the sender, on behalf of the recipient, when a transaction on the Monero network is initiated ― think of this as a <strong>“burning address”</strong>. This one-time public key is recorded as part of each transaction and designates who can spend an output in a future transaction. While observing the blockchain, third parties (such as a government or a company that performs in-depth transaction analysis) are not able to link your wallet address and the merchant’s wallet address; therefore, it is not possible to tell if Monero is being sent from you to the merchant. Through the use of Stealth Addresses, when you send Monero to a merchant, the output received by the merchant is not publicly associated with the merchant’s wallet address. If you are in a position where you need proof that you sent Monero to the merchant, your wallet will be able to verify that the transaction was indeed sent. In addition, Stealth Addresses ensure that the merchant can always know that a third-party will not be able to see if or when any Monero has been sent and received. This unique feature of a Monero transaction is especially attractive to merchants, because it serves as a way to protect sensitive financial and operational information.</p><p>To better understand the concept of Stealth Addresses, let’s consider an example where you send a parcel to your friend via the postal system ― where every movement of the parcel, from sender to recipient, is tracked. At the beginning of this exchange, your friend tells you the home address. From there, you bring the parcel to the post office and send it along to your friend’s home address that was provided. During the course of this transfer, via the tracking code that was provided by the postal system, you can see the movement of the parcel between you and your friend, including your friend’s home addresses. This is analogous to Bitcoin ― where every movement of the transaction, from sender to recipient, is traceable. However, if you told your friend to use a temporary post box, no one would associate the movement of the parcel to your friend, since finding the owner of a temporary box is difficult.</p><p>How are these one-time addresses generated? Your Monero wallet’s public address is a 95-character string, which incorporates two public keys (public view key and public send key) that are mathematically derived from your seed. When a customer sends Monero to a merchant, the customer will use the public keys in the merchant’s address along with some random data to generate a unique one-time public key for the merchant’s new output. While observers of the blockchain can see the one-time public key, the customer and the merchant are the only parties who definitively know that, in fact, the customer sent the Monero to the merchant. While the merchant’s wallet is scanning or syncing, the wallet’s private view key is being used to check all transactions and accompanying outputs on the blockchain in an effort to locate the output destined for its wallet. Once the output is detected and received by the merchant’s wallet, the merchant is now able to calculate a one-time private key that corresponds with the one-time public key and, if the merchant chooses, spend the relevant output with the wallet’s private spend key. Thanks to Stealth Addresses, this transaction process occurs without publicly linking any transaction to the merchant’s wallet address.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/stealthaddress/3_burn_800px.png" alt="One stealth address and one payment"></p><p>Simply put, a Stealth Address is a powerful cryptographic technique that prevents outputs from being linked to a recipient’s public address. As described above, this is accomplished through the use of one-time public keys. Only the recipient has the ability to identify their designated output while scanning the blockchain and, once received, the output can only be spent by the recipient. Seeing that outputs are unlinkable, the recipient’s privacy is secured.</p><p>While the concept of Stealth Addresses can seem quite technical to some, one of the user-friendly features of this technology is that the sender and recipient do not need to take any further steps outside the normal process of performing a transaction, because Stealth Addresses are implemented by default. Despite being a key feature of a Monero transaction, and through being implemented by default, Stealth Addresses can fly under the radar and be considered just another cog in the well-oiled machine.</p><p>A commonly asked question is: “But if they’re randomly generated, is it possible a collision could occur?” Luigi1111, collaborator and member of the Monero Core Team, gives us an estimate. Using the birthday paradox for the calculation, it would take about 2^126 Stealth Addresses generated to have a 50% collision occur. You would need 85,070,591,730,234,615,865,843,651,857,942,052,864 transactions, when at the time of writing, the transactions within the Monero network are approximately 8 million. For comparison, there are far fewer grains of sand in the world than the number of transactions that would be needed for such a collision. This is an impressive number that confirms the security of this powerful cryptographic technique.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/stealthaddress/4_birthdays_800px.png" alt="Many stealth addresses are linked to wallet"></p><p>Lastly, an important point to make is what Stealth Addresses are not. With payment systems that accept Bitcoin or Ethereum, you might find a different payment address that is generated randomly. This is not a Stealth Address, because at the blockchain level, analysis and tracking tools would be able to find a link between the two different addresses, along with what these addresses have received and sent.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Deep Learning in Clojure with Fewer Parentheses Than Keras and Python]]>

How about the number of dreaded parentheses, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>?

</table>

<p>
As we can see from the table, on every punctuation metric that I could think
of, Deep Diamond and Clojure fare better than Keras &amp; Python.
</p>

<p>
Keras uses almost twice as much parentheses than Deep Diamond. Clojure uses <code>[]</code>
for vector literals, which Deep Diamond uses as tensor shapes. You will note that
there are more than a few of these, and argue that these are parentheses, too.
Fine. Add them up, and Clojure fares slightly better than Python!
</p>

<p>
A parenthesis here and there is not a problem, but there are horror tales of
<code>(((((((</code> and <code>)))))))</code> in Lisps. Not in Clojure. See that there is not a
single <code>((</code> in the Clojure example, and only two occurances of <code>))</code>.
In Python - there are 8.
</p>

<p>
Then we come to all additional assorted punctuation in Python: commas, dots, etc.
In Clojure, there are none, while in Python there are dozens.
</p>

<p>
Python is also riddled with redundant stuff such as <code>model.add()</code>.
</p>

<p>
Etc., etc. You get my point.

<p>Researchers&nbsp;and companies are harnessing computers to identify the emotions behind our written words. While sentiment analysis is far from perfect, it manages to distill meaning from huge amounts of data — and could one day even monitor mental health.</p>



<p>By Dana Mackenzie</p>



<p>9.14.2020</p>



<p>Many people have declared 2020 the worst year ever. While such a description may seem hopelessly subjective, according to one measure, it’s true.</p>



<p>That yardstick is the Hedonometer, a computerized way of assessing both our happiness and our despair. It runs day in and day out on computers at the University of Vermont (UVM), where it scrapes some 50 million tweets per day off Twitter and then gives a quick-and-dirty read of the public’s mood. According to the Hedonometer, 2020 has been by far the most horrible year since it began keeping track in 2008.</p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/" target="_blank">Hedonometer</a> is a relatively recent incarnation of a task computer scientists have been working on for more than 50 years: using computers to assess words’ emotional tone. To build the Hedonometer, UVM computer scientist Chris Danforth had to teach a machine to understand the emotions behind those tweets — no human could possibly read them all. This process, called sentiment analysis, has made major advances in recent years and is finding more and more uses.</p>

<p>In addition to taking Twitter user’s emotional temperature, researchers are employing sentiment analysis to gauge people’s perceptions of climate change and to test conventional wisdom such as, in music, whether a minor chord is sadder than a major chord (and by how much). Businesses who covet information about customers’ feelings are harnessing sentiment analysis to assess reviews on platforms like Yelp. Some are using it to measure employees’ moods on the internal social networks at work. The technique might also have medical applications, such as identifying depressed people in need of help.</p>



<p>Sentiment analysis is allowing researchers to examine a deluge of data that was previously time-consuming and difficult to collect, let alone study, says Danforth. “In social science we tend to measure things that are easy, like gross domestic product. Happiness is an important thing that is hard to measure.”</p>



<h2>Deconstructing the ‘word stew’</h2>



<p>You might think the first step in sentiment analysis would be teaching the computer to understand what humans are saying. But that’s one thing that computer scientists cannot do; understanding language is one of the most notoriously difficult problems in artificial intelligence. Yet there are abundant clues to the emotions behind a written text, which computers can recognize even without understanding the meaning of the words.</p>



<p>The earliest approach to sentiment analysis is word-counting. The idea is simple enough: Count the number of positive words and subtract the number of negative words. An even better measure can be obtained by weighting words: “Excellent,” for example, conveys a stronger sentiment than “good.” These weights are typically assigned by human experts and are part of creating the word-to-emotion dictionaries, called lexicons, that sentiment analyses often use.</p>



<p>But word-counting has inherent problems. One is that it ignores word order, treating a sentence as a sort of word stew. And word-counting can miss context-specific cues. Consider this product review: “I’m so happy that my iPhone is nothing like my old ugly Droid.” The sentence has three negative words (“nothing,” “old,” “ugly”) and only one positive (“happy”). While a human recognizes immediately that “old” and “ugly” refer to a different phone, to the computer, it looks negative. And comparisons present additional difficulties: What does “nothing like” mean? Does it mean the speaker is <em>not</em> comparing the iPhone with the Android? The English language can be so confusing.</p>



<p>To address such issues, computer scientists have increasingly turned to more sophisticated approaches that take humans out of the loop entirely. They are using machine learning algorithms that teach a computer program to recognize patterns, such as meaningful relationships between words. For example, the computer can learn that pairs of words such as “bank” and “river” often occur together. These associations can give clues to meaning or to sentiment. If “bank” and “money” are in the same sentence, it is probably a different kind of bank.</p>

Here, a neural network-trained language model calculates the probability that various words will follow “Thou shalt.” Once the network is fully trained, it can be reverse-engineered to generate the mathematical constructs called “word embeddings,” which link words that tend to go together. These, in turn, are used as an input to more difficult language-processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A major step in such methods came in 2013, when Tomas Mikolov of Google Brain applied machine learning to construct a tool called word embeddings. These convert each word into a list of 50 to 300 numbers, called a vector. The numbers are like a fingerprint that <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">describes a word</a>, and particularly the other words it tends to hang out with.</p>



<p>To obtain these descriptors, Mikolov’s program looked at millions of words in newspaper articles and tried to predict the next word of text, given the previous words. Mikolov’s embeddings recognize synonyms: Words like “money” and “cash” have very similar vectors. More subtly, word embeddings capture elementary analogies — that king is to queen as boy is to girl, for example — even though it cannot define those words (a remarkable feat given that such analogies were part of how SAT exams assessed performance).</p>



<p>Mikolov’s word embeddings were generated by what’s called a neural network with one hidden layer. Neural networks, which are loosely modeled on the human brain, have <a href="https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2020/why-some-artificial-intelligence-smart-until-its-dumb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enabled stunning advances in machine learning</a>, including AlphaGo (which learned to play the game of Go better than the world champion). Mikolov’s network was a deliberately shallower network, so it could be a useful for a variety of tasks, such as translation and topic analysis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2020/synthetic-media-real-trouble-deepfakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deeper neural networks</a>, with more layers of “cortex,” can extract even more information about a word’s sentiment in the context of a particular sentence or document. A common reference task is for the computer to read a movie review on the Internet Movie Database and predict whether the reviewer gave it a thumbs up or thumbs down. The earliest lexicon methods achieved about 74 percent accuracy. The most sophisticated ones got up to 87 percent. The very first neural nets, in 2011, scored 89 percent. Today they perform with upwards of 94 percent accuracy — approaching that of a human. (Humor and sarcasm remain big stumbling blocks, because the written words may literally express the opposite of the intended sentiment.)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.knowablemagazine.org/collection/coronavirus-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Explore&nbsp;<em>Knowable</em>’s coronavirus coverage</a></p>



<p>Despite the benefits of neural networks, lexicon-based methods are still popular; the Hedonometer, for instance, uses a lexicon, and Danforth has no intention to change it. While neural nets may be more accurate for some problems, they come at a cost. The training period alone is one of the most computationally intensive tasks you can ask a computer to do.</p>



<p>“Basically, you’re limited by how much electricity you have,” says the Wharton School’s Robert Stine, who covers the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-statistics-030718-105242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evolution of sentiment analysis</a> in the 2019 <em>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application</em>. “How much electricity did Google use to train AlphaGo? The joke I heard was, enough to boil the ocean,” Stine says.</p>



<p>In addition to the electricity needs, neural nets require expensive hardware and technical expertise, and there’s a lack of transparency because the computer is figuring out how to tackle the task, rather than following a programmer’s explicit instructions. “It’s easier to fix errors with a lexicon,” says Bing Liu of the University of Illinois at Chicago, one of the pioneers of sentiment analysis.</p>



<h2>Measuring mental health</h2>



<p>While sentiment analysis often falls under the purview of computer scientists, it has <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ylataus/files/TausczikPennebaker2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep roots in psychology</a>. In 1962, Harvard psychologist Philip Stone developed the General Inquirer, the first computerized general purpose text analysis program for use in psychology; in the 1990s, social psychologist James Pennebaker developed an early program for sentiment analysis (the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) as a view into people’s psychological worlds. These earlier assessments revealed and confirmed patterns that experts had long-observed: Patients diagnosed with depression had distinct <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927x09351676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing styles</a>, such as using pronouns “I” and “me” more often. They used more words with negative affect, and sometimes more death-related words.</p>



<p>Researchers are now probing mental health’s expression in speech and writing by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-030320-040844" target="_blank">analyzing social media posts</a>. Danforth and Harvard psychologist Andrew Reece, for example, analyzed the Twitter posts of people with formal diagnoses of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder that were written <em>prior</em> to the diagnosis (with consent of participants). <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9" target="_blank">Signs of depression began to appear</a> as many as nine months earlier. And Facebook has an algorithm to detect users who seem to be at risk of suicide; human experts …</p></div></div>

This is a simplified example and in reality, you probably have more complex flows with more and bigger tasks. It should still give you the possibility to see what you can do with this tool. The example contains classical parts you see in many ETL flows consisting of different steps for Gathering of data (Extract), preparing and aggregation of data (Transform), and providing them somewhere as an output (Load).</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/776/1*xOynELMPA867ESFQw5Y33g.png" width="388" height="632" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*xOynELMPA867ESFQw5Y33g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/776/1*xOynELMPA867ESFQw5Y33g.png 388w" sizes="388px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/36/1*xOynELMPA867ESFQw5Y33g.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>DAG of the flow created with flow.visualize()</figcaption></figure><p id="8e29">This example is taking daily world-wide <a href="https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data/resource/ce379c1d-066a-4de8-a195-1d5e8338142a" rel="noopener">COVID data</a>, filters them by requested countries, aggregates them up on a monthly level, and finally uploads them as a human-readable CSV on AWS S3. On the left, you can see a DAG representation of the flow as it is created by Prefect.</p><p id="4d9f">The input data is in the following format provided as JSON files via an HTTP endpoint:</p><pre><span id="93a5">{<br>   "records" : [<br>      {<br>         "dateRep" : "07/09/2020",<br>         "day" : "07",<br>         "month" : "09",<br>         "year" : "2020",<br>         "cases" : 74,<br>         "deaths" : 2,<br>         "countriesAndTerritories" : "Afghanistan",<br>         "geoId" : "AF",<br>         "countryterritoryCode" : "AFG",<br>         "popData2019" : 38041757,<br>         "continentExp" : "Asia",<br>         "Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000" : "1.04884745"<br>      },<br>   ... many more records<br>  ]<br>}</span></pre><p id="6c95">The final output in CSV format is looking like this:</p><pre><span id="4f76">year_month,cases,deaths<br>2019_12,0,0<br>2020_01,5,0<br>2020_02,52,0<br>2020_03,61856,583<br>2020_04,97206,5705<br>2020_05,22363,2212<br>2020_06,12777,473<br>2020_07,14439,168<br>2020_08,33683,157</span></pre><p id="58ac">In Prefect a flow is defined in arbitrary Python code. Following you see how the functions are wired together to produce the DAG:</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Flow definition</figcaption></figure><p id="8f4a">The context manager (<em>with</em> statement) for <em>Flow</em> is creating the space to wire tasks together. Such a task can be an arbitrary python function that is annotated with <em>@task </em>or is inherited from <em>Task</em>. Both of these <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/core/concepts/tasks.html#overview" rel="noopener">constructs</a> are from Prefect. A special kind of task is a <em>Parameter</em> which acts as inputs to your flow. In this case, it is a selection in which countries your interested in for analysis and how the AWS S3 bucket is named where you want to export your data. In the following example, we will go into detail how these task functions are built.</p><p id="bd89">Let’s start with the gathering of the data and the function <em>download_data</em>. This task is the most “heavy” task as it needs to download a comparable large chunk of data (around 25 MB) and we don’t want to repeat this over and over again e.g. when re-executing the flow. Out of this reason, there are some special Prefect settings set to store the result with a daily cache key.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Cachable task</figcaption></figure><p id="5fe7"><em>donwload_data</em> seems like an arbitrary Python function you would find in many data projects but it has the <em>@task </em>annotation so that Prefect knows that this is a unit of work to place in the DAG. Prefect is using <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/core/advanced_tutorials/dask-cluster.html" rel="noopener">Dask</a> as a framework to execute and distribute work which means that these tasks themselves can do also quite some heavy-lifting. You could also imagine doing the heavy work outside of Prefect like executing a SQL on the <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/tasks/snowflake.html#snowflakequery" rel="noopener">data warehouse</a> or submitting a <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/tasks/databricks.html#databrickssubmitrun" rel="noopener">Spark job</a> on an external Big Data cluster instead of passing this to Dask.</p><p id="fcc0">In this case, we want the data to be cached so we specify that we want to checkpoint the data and that we are going to use a <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/engine/results.html#localresult" rel="noopener"><em>LocalResult</em></a> which stores the data on the local disk with <em>cloudpickle</em>. It is also possible to specify different serializers in case you want to cache it in <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/engine/serializers.html#jsonserializer" rel="noopener">JSON</a> or your own format. The <em>target</em> is the cache key which should be used and in this case, uses some templating variables provided by Prefect. The resulting cached file on disk will be saved in the following format:</p><pre><span id="5714">download_data-2020-09-08</span></pre><p id="6591">In a more production-like setup, you can also use S3 to store the data and would therefore exchange <em>LocalResult</em> with <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/engine/results.html#s3result" rel="noopener"><em>S3Result</em></a>. You can use any Python datatype that cloudpickle can serialize and instead of passing the real data, it is also an option to only forward references to data e.g. paths in S3.</p><p id="a439">The rest of the task functions are like the following:</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Simple tasks &amp; pre-defined task</figcaption></figure><p id="e03d">If you know <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="noopener">Pandas</a> this code probably looks very familiar. The only important part here is that all the unique functions are having the <em>@task </em>decorator.</p><p id="2b60">The thing unique here is <em>upload_to_s3</em> as it is not using these decorators but a pre-defined task from the Prefect <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/core/task_library/" rel="noopener">task library</a> called <em>S3Upload</em> which allows uploading data to an S3 bucket. There are many other pre-defined tasks e.g. for submitting a Databricks job, dbt job, or executing an AWS Lambda function. It is also possible to write your own reusable and generic tasks. We were doing this in the past for a task submission to AWS ECS Fargate to do the heavy-lifting like machine learning externally from Prefect/Dask.</p><p id="780d">If you want to run this flow you can run it with <strong>Prefect Core </strong>locally on your computer or with <strong>Prefect Cloud</strong> to have a nice UI for your flow and inspect logs and task failures much nicer. In this example project, I showcase the two different options. In both cases, my flow is executed locally but in the later case, it also registered in the UI of Prefect Cloud. The annotations on the functions are not needed and in this case coming from the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/" rel="noopener">click framework</a> to allow to easily build a nice CLI for your Python applications.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Two methods of executing flows</figcaption></figure><p id="53b7">I will go into details about deployment and how your flows are run in the next section.</p><p id="d04d">After running this flow a CSV file with the results should be visible in the specified S3 bucket:</p><pre><span id="a43a">aws s3 ls s3://ludwigm-bucket<br>2020-09-08 16:57:05        187 covid-monthly-2020-09-08T16:57:00.282974.csv<br>2020-09-08 18:03:31        187 covid-monthly-2020-09-08T18:03:26.231616.csv</span></pre></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="bd9e">To get a better understanding of the different moving parts I will go into more detail on how you would deploy such flows with Prefect Cloud.</p><p id="d133">If you check out the repository for this blog article you can register the flow in Prefect cloud and run it with a local in-process agent like in the following code snippet.

This is the <a href="https://medium.com/the-prefect-blog/the-prefect-hybrid-model-1b70c7fd296" rel="noopener">hybrid execution model</a> of Prefect which means that you potentially can use their cloud offering but the real execution is happening securely in your own infrastructure without your data being transferred to the Prefect cloud. How this would look like from an architecture standpoint can be seen in the next picture. For a more production-like setup, your flows are usually <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/recipes/configuring_storage.html" rel="noopener">dockerized</a> and loaded from a private docker registry like AWS ECR and executed for example with the <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/agent/fargate.html#fargateagent" rel="noopener"><em>FargateAgent</em></a>. Other options like loading flows from GitHub or S3 are also possible.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2310/1*94GyNwN0HYXf8SjHJLCDFQ.png" width="1155" height="577" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*94GyNwN0HYXf8SjHJLCDFQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*94GyNwN0HYXf8SjHJLCDFQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*94GyNwN0HYXf8SjHJLCDFQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*94GyNwN0HYXf8SjHJLCDFQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*94GyNwN0HYXf8SjHJLCDFQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Simplified architecture with multiple environments and hybrid execution model</figcaption></figure><p id="b6ad">In the following screenshots, you can see how this example flow looks like in the UI.

<p>Ten years ago, a slick new chat app called Slack was announced. It was exactly what my startup needed at the time — a chat tool that didn’t suck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward to today. Slack has essentially the same features. You send messages. You search channels. You communicate with your team. But not everything is like it used to be.</p>



<p>Sometimes, notifications don’t work. Other times, I’ll get stale indicators of unread messages. Occasionally, messages disappear when I use Slack on my phone.</p>



<p><strong>What happened? It doesn’t do anything differently, but now it works like shit.</strong></p>



<p>Building a software company and scaling it is… hard. It’s a struggle to keep your product working like it used to, especially if it gets bloated with complex features.</p>



<p>Make something scalable that solves a big problem. It should be simple, but it won’t be easy.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-data-oriented-design">What is data-oriented design?</h2>

<p>Data-oriented design is an approach to optimising programs by carefully
considering the memory layout of data structures, and their implications
for auto-vectorisation and use of the CPU cache. I highly recommend
watching Mike Acton’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">“Data-Oriented Design and C++”</a> talk
if you haven’t seen it already.</p>

<p>In this post we will cover 4 cases, using <a href="https://docs.rs/criterion/0.3.3/criterion/">criterion</a> for
benchmarking. The cases are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Struct of arrays vs. array of structs</li>
  <li>The cost of branching inside a hot loop</li>
  <li>Linked List vs. Vector iteration</li>
  <li>The cost of dynamic dispatch vs. monomorphisation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="struct-of-arrays-vs-array-of-structs">Struct of Arrays vs. Array of Structs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA">Struct of Arrays vs. Array of Structs</a> 
refers to two contrasting ways of organising entity data to be operated
over.</p>

<p>For example, imagine we are writing a video game and we would like to
have a Player struct with the following fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Player</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>health</span><span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>location</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>velocity</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>acceleration</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then at each frame, we want to update the locations and velocities of all
Players. We could write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>run_oop</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>player</span> <span>in</span> <span>players</span><span>.iter_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>player</span><span>.location</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.location</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.location</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>);</span>
        <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.acceleration</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>player</span><span>.velocity</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>player</span><span>.acceleration</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would be the usual object-oriented approach to this problem. The
issue here is that in memory the structs are stored as follows (assuming
no field re-ordering i.e. <code>#[repr(C)]</code>), on a 64-bit architecture each field will be 64
bits (8 bytes, so each Player is 64 bytes):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-- Vec&lt;Player&gt;
name  (pointer to heap)  -- Player 1
health    
location0  (tuple split for clarity) 
location1
velocity0
velocity1
acceleration0
acceleration1
name  (pointer to heap)  -- Player 2
location0    
location1
velocity0
velocity1
acceleration0
acceleration1
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the parts we want to operate on (locations, velocities and
accelerations) are not stored contiguously across different Players.
This prevents us from using vector operations to operate on multiple
players at once (since they cannot be loaded in the same CPU cache
line, usually ~64 bytes).</p>

<p>In contrast, the data-oriented approach is to design around this
limitation and optimise for auto-vectorisation. Instead of using a
struct per Player, we now use one struct for all Players and each Player
has their values stored at their index in the separate attribute Vectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>DOPlayers</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>names</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>health</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>locations</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>velocities</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>acceleration</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>,</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can do the same calculation as in the OOP case as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>run_dop</span><span>(</span><span>world</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>DOPlayers</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>vel</span><span>,</span> <span>acc</span><span>))</span> <span>in</span> <span>world</span>
        <span>.locations</span>
        <span>.iter_mut</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>world</span><span>.velocities</span><span>.iter_mut</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>world</span><span>.acceleration</span><span>.iter</span><span>()))</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>pos</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
        <span>*</span><span>vel</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>acc</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>vel</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>acc</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case the memory layout is as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>-- DOPlayers
name1    -- names
name2
...
health1    -- health
health2
...
location1    -- locations
location2
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The relevant fields are now stored contiguously. Given that each
location tuple will be 16 bytes, we could now feasibly load 4 location
tuples on the same cache line to operate on them simultaneously with
SIMD instructions.</p>

<h3 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h3>

<p>Here are the results of the criterion benchmark for the above code (the
full code and benchmark code is available <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/data-oriented-example">in the Github repo</a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://jamesmcm.github.io/images/soa.svg" alt="AoS vs. SoA benchmark" title="AoS vs. SoA benchmark"></p>

<p>Overall, we see that the data-oriented approach finishes in half the
time. This would seem to be due to the data-oriented case operating on
two Players at a time - we can confirm this by reviewing the compiled
assembly.</p>

<p>Reviewing the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/d8bjMb">output on Godbolt</a> we see the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Relevant OOP loop

        test    r8, r8
        je      .LBB1_5
</code></pre>

<p>We can see in the data-oriented case, the loop is unrolled to operate on
two elements at once - resulting in the 50% speed up overall!</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: As noted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hxqwom/an_introduction_to_data_oriented_design_with_rust/fz8lxcq/">/u/five9a2 on Reddit</a>
the above output is specifically for the default target, which is
misleading since <code>cargo bench</code> uses the native target by default (i.e.
all possible features on your CPU), so our benchmarks are not using the
above assembly code.</p>

<p>By setting the compiler flag to <code>-C target-cpu=skylake-avx512</code> to enable 
Skylake features, we get the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/PEPdvn">following output</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// OOP loop

        vmovupd ymmword ptr [rax + rdx + 32], ymm0
        add     rdx, 80
        cmp     rcx, rdx
        jne     .LBB0_2

// DOP loop

        vaddpd  zmm0, zmm0, zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax - 64]
        vmovupd zmmword ptr [rsi + 4*rax - 64], zmm0
        vmovupd zmm0, zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax - 64]
        vaddpd  zmm0, zmm0, zmmword ptr [r10 + 4*rax - 64]
        vmovupd zmmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax - 64], zmm0

</code></pre>

<p>Here we see the OOP loop making use of the 256-bit ymm registers for the
position tuple and velocity tuple, and another for the velocity tuple
and acceleration tuple. This is possible because they are adjacent in
memory (due to the ordering of the fields). In the DOP loop,
the 512-bit zmm register is used.</p>

<p>It seems the performance differences comes from the bandwidth between
cache levels, since the performance is identical for the small examples.
This can be demonstrated further by removing the extra fields from the
struct - in this case we see only a 25% performance difference (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Th91Wa">godbolt
link</a>), and this
corresponds to Player struct now being 384 bits (and so 1/4 of the
512-bit read/write is unused).</p>

<p>This emphasises how important it is to consider your deployment target,
and if deploying performance-sensitive code, to consider setting the
target-cpu explicitly to benefit from all of its features.</p>

<p>It also demonstrates how the ordering of fields can be important to
performance. By default Rust will re-order fields automatically, but you can set
<code>#[repr(C)]</code> to disable this (necessary for C interoperability for
example).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>This example demonstrates the importance of considering memory layout
when aiming for performant code and auto-vectorisation.</p>

<p>Note that the same logic can also apply when working with arrays of
structs - making your struct smaller will allow you to load more
elements on the same cache line and possibly lead to autovectorisation.
<a href="https://github.com/Rene-007/flake_growth/blob/master/src/helpers.rs">Here is an example</a> of
a crate (which was shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hmqjvs/growing_gold_with_rust/">Rust subreddit</a>) that achieved a 40% performance
improvement by doing just that.</p>

<p>This particular re-organisation has a direct analogue in database design. A
major difference between databases aimed at transactional (OLTP)
workloads and analytical (OLAP) workloads is that the latter tend to use
columnar-based storage. Just like the case above, this means that
operations on one column can take advantage of the contiguous storage
and use vector operations, which tends to be the main access pattern for
analytical workloads (e.g. calculate the average purchase size across all rows,
rather than updating and retrieving entire, specific rows).</p>

<p>In the case of analytical databases this is actually a double win, since it also
applies to the serialisation of the data to disk, where compression can
now be applied along the column (where the data is guaranteed to be of the
same type) leading to much better compression ratios.</p>

<p>If you are working on a problem that might benefit from the struct of
arrays approach, and want to run a quick benchmark, you might be
interested in the <a href="https://github.com/lumol-org/soa-derive">soa-derive</a>
crate that will allow you to derive the struct of arrays from your
struct.</p>

<h2 id="branching-in-a-hot-loop">Branching in a hot loop</h2>

<p>Another optimisation tactic is to avoid branching in any “hot” parts of
the code (i.e. any part that will be executed many, many times).</p>

The incident occurred on July 9 on Highway 2 near Ponoka, about 100 kilometres south of Edmonton.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Alberta RCMP)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>The RCMP&nbsp;in Alberta have charged a&nbsp;20-year-old British Columbia man with&nbsp;speeding while he was asleep at the wheel of a Tesla electric car.</p>  <p>The RCMP&nbsp;received&nbsp;a call at about&nbsp;4 p.m. on July 9 concerning&nbsp;a 2019 Tesla Model S speeding south on Highway 2 near Ponoka, about 100&nbsp;kilometres south of Edmonton.</p>  <p>Both front seats were fully&nbsp;reclined, and both the driver and passenger&nbsp;appeared to be sound asleep, police say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The car appeared to be driving on&nbsp;autopilot at more than 140 km/h, RCMP&nbsp;Sgt. Darrin Turnbull&nbsp;told CBC News on Thursday. The speed limit on that stretch of highway is 110 km/h.</p>  <p>"Nobody was looking out the windshield to see where the car was going," he&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I've been in policing for over 23 years&nbsp;and the&nbsp;majority of that in traffic&nbsp;law enforcement, and I'm speechless.</p>  <p>"I've never, ever seen anything like this before, but of course the technology wasn't there."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Tesla Model S sedans have autopilot functions, including auto-steer and "traffic-aware" cruise control, and both functions appeared to be activated.</p>  <p>"We believe the vehicle&nbsp;was operating on the autopilot system, which is really just an advanced driver safety system, a driver assist program. You still need to be driving the vehicle," Turnbull said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"But of course, there are after-market things that can be done to a vehicle against the manufacturer's recommendations to change or circumvent the safety system."&nbsp;</p>  <p>After the responding officer activated emergency lights on their vehicle, the Tesla automatically began to accelerate, Turnbull said, even as those vehicles that were ahead of the Tesla on the highway moved out of the way.</p>  <p>"Nobody appeared to be in the car, but the vehicle sped up because the line was clear in front."</p>  <ul>  </ul>  <p>The responding officer obtained radar readings on the vehicle, confirming that it had automatically accelerated to exactly 150 km/h.</p>  <p>The RCMP charged the driver with speeding and issued a 24-hour licence suspension for fatigue.&nbsp;</p>  <p>After further investigation and consultation with the Crown, a Criminal Code charge of dangerous driving was laid against the driver, police said.</p>  <p>The driver was served with a summons for court in December.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-s-self-driving-autopilot-system-under-scrutiny-1.5413931" target="_blank">Tesla's self-driving Autopilot system under scrutiny after 3 deadly crashes</a></strong></li>   <li><strong><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/driverless-tesla-richmond-b-c-1.5349855" target="_blank">Driverless Tesla coasting along mall parking lot raises questions, causes confusion</a></strong></li>  </ul>  <p>Autonomous cars are in their early stages in much of Canada, with Ontario and Quebec approving pilot projects as long as a vigilant driver is present to take control of the vehicle when needed.</p>  <p>There have not been any reported self-driving car crashes in Canada, but several have been reported in the United States, putting Tesla's autopilot driving system functions&nbsp;under scrutiny.</p>  <p>On Dec. 29, 2019, a Tesla Model S sedan left a freeway in Gardena, Calif., at high speed, ran a red light and struck a Honda Civic, killing two people inside, police said. On the same day, a Tesla Model 3 hit a parked firetruck on an Indiana freeway, killing a passenger in the Tesla.</p>  <p>On Dec. 7, a Model 3 struck a police cruiser on a Connecticut highway, but&nbsp;no one was hurt.</p>  <p>Tesla's autopilot function is designed to keep a car in its lane and at a safe distance from other vehicles. Autopilot also can change lanes on its own.</p>  <ul>  </ul>  <h2>'It&nbsp;gives all of us a bad name'</h2>  <p>Angie Dean, president of the Tesla Owners Club of Alberta, said the incident is troubling for the 300 paying members of her group&nbsp;and the more than 1,000 active members of the club's online Facebook group.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dean said the driver-assist functions in Tesla vehicles are designed to enhance safety, not detract from it.</p>  <p>"This type of story is sort of next to&nbsp;a worst-case scenario," she&nbsp;said. "The only thing that would be worse than this is if someone had got hurt.&nbsp;Everyone that I've spoken with is just so disappointed and so frustrated because it's abuse of the system.</p>  <p>"It&nbsp;gives all of us a bad name, and the vast majority of us would never do something like this. We bought these cars because we want to be safer."</p>  <p>The driver-assist program&nbsp;requires&nbsp;regular input from the driver to function,&nbsp;Dean said. If the driver's hands come off the wheel, warnings begin going off every 15 seconds, she said.</p>  <p>"It asks you to put your hands on the wheel&nbsp;and&nbsp;turn it a little bit so that it knows that your hands are on the wheel," Dean said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If you don't, it starts beeping at you. And if you still don't, it gets even louder. And&nbsp;if you still don't, it actually turns the hazard lights on, slows the vehicle down and it pulls it over. It turns the car off and autopilot will not engage for the rest of that drive."</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH | Is the technology behind driverless cars ready for the road?</em></strong></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>The technology behind self-driving cars is available and in use, but there are examples showing it may not be fully ready for the real world.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:09</span></span></span></p>  <p>Despite the built-in safeguards, videos&nbsp;circulating online instruct drivers on ways to "hack" and override&nbsp;these systems, Dean&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"There are a lot of systems that are in place that are really, really trying not to make this possible. But if there's a will, there's a way, I suppose. "&nbsp;</p>  <p>Just because some vehicles can drive themselves, it doesn't mean they should, the RCMP said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;"Although manufacturers of new vehicles have built in safeguards to prevent drivers from taking advantage of the new safety systems in vehicles, those systems are just that — supplemental safety systems," said Supt. Gary Graham of Alberta RCMP Traffic Services.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They are not self-driving systems, they still come with the responsibility of driving."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

2000 by Steve Jobs<sup><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup>. Since then,
including the Public Beta of version 10.0, there have been 17 different releases
till now. The next one, version 11.0, titled Big Sur, is coming later this year.</p><p>In the intervening two decades, a lot has changed. In 2002, Steve Jobs famously
dropped support for OS 9 by staging a funeral at WWDC. Macs transitioned from
PowerPC to Intel chips and later to 64-bit only. Apple switched from naming
releases after big cats like Panther and Jaguar to naming releases after
California locations. It also renamed Mac OS X to macOS to conform better with
iOS and later iPadOS.</p><p>The interface started glassy and skeuomorphic, mimicking the materials used on
Macs. Over the decades, it went through significant
revisions<sup><a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>One thing that seems to have remained relatively unchanged over the years is the
System Preferences screen.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/457568483?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>But, at a closer glance, we’ll see that this mundane part of the operating
system has changed quite a bit and hides some fun easter eggs and surprises.</p><h2 id="how-things-have-changed">How things have changed</h2><h3 id="favorites-bar">Favorites bar</h3><p>Early versions of OS X until 10.3 included a favorites bar at the top where
users could drag and drop their favorite settings. In 10.4, this was removed and
replaced with the search feature that highlights matching icons as you type a
query.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h3 id="mouse">Mouse</h3><p>The first mouse to appear System Preferences is the black translucent Apple Pro
Mouse<sup><a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a></sup>. Between the Public Beta and the
10.0 release, an optical sensor’s red glow was added to reflect how the mouse
looks when in use. Following that is the white iteration of that mouse, the
short-lived Mighty Mouse, and then finally the Magic Mouse, which has undergone
only minor updates till today.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3><p>Similarly, the keyboard icons have represented the keyboard available at the
given time. In 10.0, it’s an Apple Pro Keyboard. From 10.1 to 10.5, it’s only a
single command key, but then in 10.6, a full keyboard is shown again.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><p>Peculiarly, in 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5, the Mouse and Keyboard settings were
combined into one, but then in 10.6, they were split up again.</p><h3 id="displays">Displays</h3><p>Unsurprisingly, the Displays icon has always reflected the latest Apple display
starting with the transparent polycarbonate Cinema Displays until today’s Pro
Display XDR. The small size allocated to the icons has meant that they usually
look a little cartoonish and out of proportion, but still consistent with the
rest of the icon set. However, in Big Sur, the display icon’s proportions were
adjusted much closer to how Pro Display XDR looks in reality.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h3 id="print--fax">Print &amp; Fax</h3><p>10.3 introduced the Print &amp; Fax setting. Then in 10.7, amidst the waning use of
fax machines, it was renamed Print and Scan. Finally, in 10.9, it was renamed
again to the nouns Printers &amp; Scanners to fit grammatically with everything
else.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h3 id="energy-saver">Energy Saver</h3><p>In the first OS X Public Beta, a shade drawn over a window represented Energy
Saver. Before release, the now recognizable light bulb took its place.</p><p>Over the years, the icon has represented the most efficient light bulb
technology of the time. So, in 10.5, the icon changed from an incandescent bulb
to a more efficient compact fluorescent. Then, in 10.10, the light bulb changed
again to an LED design.</p><p><span>

(they are keeping it for desktops), replacing it with the more intuitively
named”Battery setting. Oh, light bulb icon, you will be missed.</p><h3 id="network">Network</h3><p>In the Public Beta, Network was a globe focused on the western hemisphere, with
lines drawn as if connecting cities. Just three releases later in 10.3, that was
changed over to the abstract glass ball with circular lines, a variation of
which we still see today.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>In Big Sur, after 20 years of showing July 18, that icon has changed to July 17,
likely to conform with the Calendar app icon. iCal, as the Calendar app was
previously known, was first shown to the public on July 17, 2002.</p><h3 id="language--region">Language &amp; Region</h3><p>At first, this one was called International, then renamed to Language &amp; Text and

This expires in October.</strong></em></p><p id="viewer-3ijv9">I will start this post by getting straight to the point – I have evidence that suggests <strong>Nvidia is trying to have their cake and eat it too </strong>when it comes to the perceived price/performance of their new Ampere RTX 30-Series lineup. They are attempting to <strong>appear</strong> to be launching a lineup that is priced lower than their much maligned Turing generation, but in reality these things will cost<strong> far more </strong>than they are letting on for the overwhelming majority of shoppers this fall.</p><p id="viewer-aktp7">To be clear – <strong>most</strong> of my information comes from an industry veteran. This is a source who has<strong> never </strong>given me information that wasn’t eventually proven right, but it is still just one person who provided <strong>most</strong> of the information in this expose. I want to be honest about that with my readers from the start, but be rest assured that I did <strong>independently verify</strong> some of the details with other provenly reliable sources before this was published. I did dig into select details myself for verification, and every time I dug - nothing from the original source turned up false, and no red flags were raised. So, I am publishing this info, and making sure to do so before Ampere reviews go live. I believe <strong>this is information PC Gamers need to know as soon as possible</strong>.</p><h2 id="viewer-5pkbh"><strong><u>Nvidia’s Low Volume Loss Leaders</u></strong></h2><div id="viewer-6u1d0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/nvidia-s-ultimate-play" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd85b6_f3194379ae844f0aaa35a0d02c902c3b~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1221,h_774,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd85b6_f3194379ae844f0aaa35a0d02c902c3b~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fueup">In June, <em>Igor’s Lab</em> ran a story alleging he had sources confirming the Founders Edition coolers cost more than $150 to manufacture. My source concurs with Igor, even going as far as to say that Igor’s number may be<strong> a lowball</strong> based on what this individual has been told. Additionally, AIBs have confirmed to my source that Nvidia forced them to provide BOM (Bill of Materials) cost-downs in order for their cooling designs to be approved for sale. This is far from a normal requirement for Nvidia, and in fact it gets weirder when you learn that supposedly most AIB BOM’s detailed margins below 40% if sold even close to MSRP. Some of you probably just connected the dots to what is going on here.</p><p id="viewer-ako0d">For those who don’t know - Nvidia usually likes margins above 60%, and Nvidia’s cooler definitely costs far more to manufacture than most GPU cooler designs that will be hitting the market on Ampere cards this fall. However, they don’t plan to actually sell many of those Founders cards…</p><p id="viewer-8vlo8">I now need to mention another of <em>Igor’s Lab’s</em> published findings. According to Igor, Samsung’s 8nm node is not having bad yields. In fact, the limited launch availability is due to a shortage of Founders Edition coolers. But the truth according to my main source is that <strong>there isn’t</strong> <strong>a shortage of coolers per se</strong>. If Nvidia wanted more of them, they could have had more of them – it’s <strong>scarcity by design.</strong></p><p id="viewer-er01m">Now let me spell out the real purpose of Nvidia’s extravagant Founders Edition: making sure reviewers have the best samples, with the best coolers, and at an <strong>alluring price</strong> most gamers won’t be able to obtain <strong>by design</strong>. They are accepting lower margins than usual on their FE cards with the knowledge that these published results will set unrealistic expectations for gamers. Unrealistic expectations that will stand the test of time in Day One Reviews that will be referenced for years…</p><p id="viewer-8io8c">But this story goes much further than simply “putting your best foot forward” with Day One Review Cards most people can’t buy. Both Founders and AIB cards will be in short supply in September, <strong>but AIB cards will stuff the channels by the end of October.</strong></p><p id="viewer-fa61a">Therefore, I think this is Nvidia’s <em>Ultimate Play: </em><strong>Intentionally </strong>causing an initial dearth of Ampere stock, allowing “supply and demand” to <strong>inflate the street price </strong>of Ampere when those beautiful $699 Founders cards <strong>instantly</strong> sell out, and then ultimately forcing AIBs to sell most of their models well above MSRP due to the required BOM Cost-Downs…that will be in ample supply once the street price is elevated.</p><h2 id="viewer-1b4gs"><strong><u>The Ultimate Play</u></strong></h2><div id="viewer-a3gi1"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/nvidia-s-ultimate-play" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd85b6_c73584cea2734af194348297df12dd12~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1427,h_803,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd85b6_c73584cea2734af194348297df12dd12~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fj4qs">Nvidia knows that RADEON will be more competitive this year than they have been for the past 5 years. This means they need to go hard with aggressive marketing and <strong>perceived</strong> price/performance than they have had to for quite some time. At the same time, Nvidia’s stock price is sitting at an all-time high, above $450 as of this writing. That is<strong> over double </strong>where it was just one year ago. If what this source alleges is true, Nvidia is seemingly attempting to <strong>keep margins elevated</strong> for another killer earnings season, and yet at the same time trying not to be perceived as the “bad guy” anymore. I will now completely lay out what I am saying, and provide the remaining details:</p><ol><li id="viewer-omb6"><p>Nvidia wants to keep their 50%+ <strong>average</strong> margins while pretending they are offering good value.</p></li><li id="viewer-caq6f"><p>They seek to accomplish this by selling incredible Founders Editions with low margins (at MSRP) from their website, but with painfully limited stock <strong>by design</strong>. </p></li><li id="viewer-e9m14"><p>Nvidia knows that if they get stellar Day One reviews <strong>praising</strong> Ampere for its performance <strong>and value</strong>, they will win back the hearts of gamers – which they lost with Turing – before RDNA 2 launches. Most people only read and remember the Day One reviews.</p></li><li id="viewer-9eudd"><p>There should be AIB models available day 1, but I am told <strong>only ~20% of the stock</strong> is required to be <strong>near</strong> MSRP, and likely in models with <strong>far inferior</strong> coolers to the FE design. Already a glance at some of the announced AIB cards <strong>shows</strong> that indeed, these are <strong>not</strong> going to be sold at MSRP: <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/86681-aftermarket-rtx-3080-rtx-3090-card-prices-revealed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.techspot.com/news/86681-aftermarket-rtx-3080-rtx-3090-card-prices-revealed.html</a></p></li><li id="viewer-5tlea"><p>Additionally, Nvidia is allegedly causing supply of all Ampere models (<strong>including AIB</strong>) to be artificially limited during the first month of sales. Nvidia is supposedly doing so by controlling some key components AIBs need. I was able to <strong>independently verify</strong> this with an AIB who said “There will be low stock at launch, but <strong>it’s just propaganda</strong>.” </p></li><li id="viewer-6pj5b"><p>Ampere demand will outstrip the initial stock, and so the <strong>price will balloon </strong>by October.</p></li><li id="viewer-66ptu"><p>Eventually, this stock issue will suddenly disappear, much sooner than we have been led to believe with rumors about bad yields.</p></li><li id="viewer-5c742"><p>If all of this is true, Nvidia could state that the elevated prices <strong>aren’t</strong> their doing, and they could do so while pointing to a very limited number of cards that sell for MSRP every week. Likely models with the cheapest coolers.</p></li><li id="viewer-6nu4e"><p>The double memory versions of cards (RTX 3080 20GB, RTX 3070 16GB) should land roughly around when Nvidia stuffs the inventory in October. These will also come with<strong> a far higher price </strong>than the original models.</p></li><li id="viewer-3vnk2"><p>I can confirm that the double memory cards will <strong>not</strong> be sold from Nvidia’s website, and thus they will be able to <strong>claim </strong>AIBs are behind the price hike. These marked up cards are likely what Nvidia<strong> really </strong>wants you all to buy, and yet all those Day One reviews will say the 3080 is “Just $700.” <strong>Having your cake and eating it too.</strong></p></li><li id="viewer-eejt7"><p>Samsung’s 8nm node sounds<strong> much more </strong>able than previously reported by MLID. It doesn’t sound like there are “yield” problems on Samsung’s glorified 10nm node in 2020. At least not problems big enough to cause Ampere stock to be as low as it will be artificially at launch.</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-crqr8">I will be honest. The logical side of my brain has tortured me into admitting this plan is <strong>brilliant,</strong> if true. AMD may compete with Nvidia in price, performance, and especially efficiency this fall – but Nvidia is<strong> the master </strong>of winning mindshare and keeping margins high <strong>at the same time. </strong>In this writer’s eyes, the plan could absolutely allow Jensen to send golden samples, the best of the best, to reviewers, with a <strong>stunningly effective cooler</strong> that garners universal acclaim next to their aggressive (and mostly fake) MSRPs.</p><p id="viewer-c1534"><strong>This could go down in history as Jensen’s <em>Ultimate Play</em></strong>, and I am honestly not sure what we can do about it. But I do concur with my source that gamers deserved to know.</p><h2 id="viewer-7ug0v"><strong><u>Epilogue: A Word on Big Navi, and Some Advice for Gamers This Fall</u></strong></h2><div id="viewer-6o80q"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/nvidia-s-ultimate-play" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd85b6_b652a7e0f704478bba33c61b37de91ad~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_947,h_532,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd85b6_b652a7e0f704478bba33c61b37de91ad~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-80j5f">Finally, I would like to provide some updates – or more accurately <strong>adjustments</strong> - to what I expect from AMD’s (Always Massive Delays') “Big Navi.” I am confident that RADEON <strong>will</strong> release a Navi 21-derived card that is the following:</p><ul><li id="viewer-btai4"><p><strong><u>At least</u></strong> within spitting distance of the RTX 3080 in rasterization performance. If AMD doesn’t “beat” the 3080, they will assuredly <strong>crush</strong> the RTX 3070.</p></li><li id="viewer-5us83"><p>Substantially <strong>more efficient</strong> at originally intended clocks than Ampere, although they may <strong>push some models a bit</strong> to more directly compete with the 3080. Even when pushed, I do not expect these models to be power hogs.</p></li><li id="viewer-dgil8"><p>Potentially smaller than many people seem to expect, at least relative to Ampere. The specs I have just been made aware of are close to what I had <strong>incorrectly</strong> <strong>assumed</strong> must be Navi 22. This is made possible by incredible improvements to how RDNA <strong>manages memory and bandwidth</strong>. It should (for the first time since before GCN) make due with <strong>less bandwidth</strong> than Nvidia counterparts.</p></li><li id="viewer-7ukvn"><p>Provides Ray Tracing capabilities that overall <strong>exceed Turing</strong>, but likely <strong>underperform Ampere</strong>.</p></li><li id="viewer-e0m9m"><p><strong>No </strong>confirmation on what AMD’s answer to DLSS will be, but they<strong> are </strong>“taking it seriously.” The software stack is simply not confirmed yet.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-1p0rt">AMD is <strong>unlikely to match</strong> Nvidia in die size, but it sounds like <strong>they won’t need to</strong> in order to have RADEON cards roughly competing (or maybe even exceeding) the 3080, while using <strong>far less energy</strong>. This in some ways will disappoint those that were <strong>unrealistically</strong> hoping “Navi 2X” is secretly “Navi 2.5X”, but it should come as good news for the majority of gamers that just want a <strong>decent $400-$600 card</strong> that doesn’t require a new power supply. I have stopped <strong>just short</strong> of saying the exact specs and performance I expect out of “Big Navi,” and that’s because I should be able to provide real &amp; tested performance numbers <strong>incredibly soon</strong>. So just stay tuned for more info from MLID on this.</p><p id="viewer-fbrpi">Some advice to leakers too – many of the widely accepted “Big Navi” CU &amp; Memory Bus estimates sound <strong>entirely incorrect </strong>to me at this point.

September 17, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/oso-azure | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/oso-azure">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Securing application resources usually consists of two security processes: authentication and authorization. <em>Authentication</em> determines the identity of a user, and is often accomplished by some kind of sign-in process. <em>Authorization</em> determines whether or not a user is allowed to access a resource, typically based on their authenticated identity but often based on other factors as well, like having a certain role, being in a group, having specific attributes or meeting other criteria relevant to the use case.</p>
<p>A common authentication pattern involves the application exchanging information with an <em>Identity Provider,</em> or "IdP", to confirm the identity of the user. Well-known IdPs include Facebook, Google, and GitHub.</p>
<p>This post will show how to add authentication and authorization to a simple Flask app, using Azure Active Directory B2C as an IdP, and oso's <code>oso-flask</code> library to authorize requests.</p>
<h3>Summary of what we'll cover:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sign in users with Azure AD B2C</li>
<li>Use oso to restrict access to signed-in users</li>
<li>Add custom user attributes to our user profile</li>
<li>Write a policy to control access based on user attributes, like job title or team</li>
<li>Access Microsoft user data, like groups and managers, with the Graph API</li>
<li>Write an oso policy to implement role-based access control using Microsoft groups</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>This post uses an example application that's written in Python with Flask. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> ("AD") is Microsoft's cloud-based identity management service. We'll use it to sign in users and store user data. This example uses a newer variant of Active Directory called "<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">B2C</a>", which is designed for business-to-consumer apps to manage customer identities.</p>
<p><strong>oso</strong> is an open-source policy engine for authorization that is embedded in your application. We'll use oso to authorize user access to our application's resources. Since our example application uses Flask, we're using the <code>oso-flask</code> <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/flask.html">integration</a>, which includes middleware for authorizing Flask requests.</p>
<p>The example we'll use in this post is a very simple application that stores and displays documents. Its authorization model is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can always view documents that they are the owner of</li>
<li>Documents can belong to user groups</li>
<li>Public documents can be viewed by anyone</li>
<li>Private documents can only be viewed by users that belong to one of the document's groups</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authentication with Azure AD B2C</h2>
<p>We used a <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp">sample app</a> provided by Microsoft as the starting point for our example. Following Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-web-app-python?tabs=app-reg-ga">tutorial</a> on setting up authentication in their sample application will get you to the same starting point (you may have to complete a few prerequisite steps as well).</p>
<p>By the end of the tutorial, you should have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=app-reg-ga">registered the application</a> with your Azure AD <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant">B2C tenant</a>. We've registered ours as "python-webapp":</p>
<p><img alt="Adding%20auth%20to%20a%20Flask%20App%20with%20Azure%20Active%20Direc%20e4020384c5a348e499250ae95d24e0d1/Untitled.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/oso-azure/Adding%20auth%20to%20a%20Flask%20App%20with%20Azure%20Active%20Direc%20e4020384c5a348e499250ae95d24e0d1/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>You should also have set up several <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows">User Flows</a> in the Azure portal for signing in, profile editing, and logging out:</p>
<p><img alt="Adding%20auth%20to%20a%20Flask%20App%20with%20Azure%20Active%20Direc%20e4020384c5a348e499250ae95d24e0d1/Untitled%201.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/oso-azure/Adding%20auth%20to%20a%20Flask%20App%20with%20Azure%20Active%20Direc%20e4020384c5a348e499250ae95d24e0d1/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<p>When you set up the user flows, make sure that you check the following boxes in "User Attributes" and "Application Claims":</p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Given name</li>
<li>Surname</li>
<li>Display Name</li>
<li>Job Title</li>
<li>Object ID (Application Claims only)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've reached the end of the tutorial, your app should be able to sign users in with an email and password, allow them to edit their profile, and log them out. Each of these user flows should return an <code>id_token</code> JWT to your app's redirect handler that stores the above attributes as claims. If you use Microsoft's provided JWT decoder, <a href="https://jwt.ms/">https://jwt.ms</a>, to test your user flow, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Adding%20auth%20to%20a%20Flask%20App%20with%20Azure%20Active%20Direc%20e4020384c5a348e499250ae95d24e0d1/Untitled%202.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/oso-azure/Adding%20auth%20to%20a%20Flask%20App%20with%20Azure%20Active%20Direc%20e4020384c5a348e499250ae95d24e0d1/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<p>Once you've completed the tutorial, the application can be run with the following command from the root directory:</p>
<pre><code>flask run --host localhost --port 5000
</code></pre>

<p>If you'd like to run our <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example">sample application</a>, make sure to update the information in <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/app_config.py#L3-L17">app_config.py</a>:</p>
<pre><code># app_config.py

b2c_tenant = "your-tenant-name"
signupsignin_user_flow = "B2C_1_signupsignin1"
editprofile_user_flow = "B2C_1_profileediting1"
resetpassword_user_flow = "B2C_1_passwordreset1"
authority_template = (
    "https://{tenant}.b2clogin.com/{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/{user_flow}"
)

CLIENT_ID = (
    "Enter_the_Application_Id_here"  # Application (client) ID of app registration
)

CLIENT_SECRET = (
    "Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here"  # Placeholder - for use ONLY during testing.
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating the User model</h3>
<p>Microsoft's sample app stores a raw dictionary of the <code>id_token</code> claims globally in <code>session["user"]</code>. In our app, we created a User <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/user.py#L13-L20">class</a> to store the user data, which we'll add to later on:</p>
<pre><code># user.py

class User:
    def __init__(self, id_token_claims):
        self.id = id_token_claims.get("oid")
        self.display_name = id_token_claims.get("name")
        self.first_name = id_token_claims.get("given_name")
        self.surname = id_token_claims.get("family_name")
        self.emails = id_token_claims.get("emails")
        self.job_title = id_token_claims.get("jobTitle")
</code></pre>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/app.py#L60-L61">our redirect handler</a>, we construct an instance of the current <code>User</code> from the <code>id_token_claims</code> dictionary, and store it on the <code>session</code> object:</p>
<pre><code># app.py

@app.route(app_config.REDIRECT_PATH)
def authorized():
    # ...
    user = User(id_token_result.get("id_token_claims"))
    session["user"] = user
</code></pre>

<p>We've successfully added authentication to our app. Now let's use oso to authorize our authenticated users' requests.</p>
<h2>Adding oso</h2>
<p>Since we're building a Flask app, we're going to use the <code>flask-oso</code> package to add oso to our application. <code>flask-oso</code> is an even lighter weight form of the <code>oso</code> package that provides convenient middleware for authorizing Flask requests. You can find a helpful guide to using <code>flask-oso</code> in our <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/flask.html">docs</a>.</p>
<p>We followed three steps to add oso to the application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>.polar</code> policy file</li>
<li>Initialize the global oso instance by loading the policy and registering relevant application classes</li>
<li>Add calls to <code>flask_oso.FlaskOso.authorize()</code> at authorization enforcement points</li>
</ol>
<h3>Writing a policy</h3>
<p>oso policies are written in a declarative policy language called Polar, and are stored in files with the <code>.polar</code> extension. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/index.html">Writing Policie</a>s for an overview of how to use oso policies.</p>
<p>The policy file in this example is called <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/authorization.polar#L1-L3">authorization.polar</a>. We started with a simple rule to allow any logged-in user to get a public document:</p>
<pre><code># authorization.polar

# allow anyone to get public documents
allow(_actor: User, "GET", doc: Document) if
    not doc.is_private;
</code></pre>

<p>This rule works by specializing the <code>_actor</code> on the <code>User</code> class, which means that only actors of type <code>User</code> are allowed to take any action on any resource. Since <code>get_current_user()</code>, which is used to get the default actor, returns <code>None</code> when the current user is not logged in, the rule only applies when the current user is authenticated. The <code>doc</code> argument is specialized on the <code>Document</code> class, which allows us to safely access the <code>is_private</code> field.</p>
<h3>Initializing oso</h3>
<p>We wrote a function called <code>init_oso()</code>, which we put in a file called <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/master/oso_auth.py">oso_auth.py</a>:</p>
<pre><code># oso_auth.py

from oso import Oso
from flask_oso import FlaskOso

from document import Document
import user
from user import User

def init_oso(app):
    """ set up the `Oso` and `FlaskOso` objects, and add them to the global `app` instance."""
    oso = Oso()
    oso.register_class(Document)
    oso.register_class(User)
    oso.load_file("authorization.polar")

    flask_oso = FlaskOso(app=app, oso=oso)
    flask_oso.set_get_actor(user.get_current_user)

    app.oso = oso
    app.flask_oso = flask_oso
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>init_oso()</code> function creates an <code>Oso</code> instance, on which it registers the <code>User</code> class and the <code>Document</code> class that represents the app's document resources (registering Python classes with oso lets us reference them in our oso policies).</p>
<p>The function then uses the <code>Oso</code> instance to create the <code>FlaskOso</code> instance that we'll use to authorize requests. We call the <code>set_get_actor()</code> method to set the default actor to the current user. This default is used when we make calls to <code>flask_oso.authorize()</code> later on. The <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/user.py#L56-L57">method</a> we pass in, <code>get_current_user()</code> looks up the user on the session object:</p>
<pre><code># user.py

from flask import session

def get_current_user():
    return session.get("user")
</code></pre>

<h3>Authorizing requests</h3>
<p>We're now ready to use the oso library to authorize requests. In this example application, the resources we want to secure are documents, represented by the <code>Document</code> <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/document.py#L11-L46">class</a> in <code>document.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code># document.py

@dataclass
class Document:
    id: int
    owner_id: str
    groups: list
    is_private: bool
    content: str

def find_by_id(id):
    return DOCUMENTS.get(id)

DOCUMENTS = {
    1: Document(
        id=1,
        owner_id="5890e32a-c2ac-4aa0-902d-0717017d1bc3",
        groups=["engineering"],
        is_private=True,
        content="This is a private engineering doc.",
    ),
    2: Document(
        id=2,
        owner_id="273dd85f-0728-44c0-8588-c130f39c900b",
        groups=["marketing"],
        is_private=True,
        content="This is a private marketing doc.",
    ),
    3: Document(
        id=3,
        owner_id="273dd85f-0728-44c0-8588-c130f39c900b",
        groups=["admin"],
        is_private=False,
        content="This is a public admin doc.",
    ),
}
</code></pre>

<p>For this example we've simply hardcoded the document data, but this data would normally be stored in a database.</p>
<p><code>document.py</code> has a <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-azure-ad-example/blob/11aa2c113b7802b3136575e9900420511089834d/document.py#L55-L59">route</a> for viewing the documents, to which we've added a call to <code>flask_oso.FlaskOso.authorize()</code>:</p>
<pre><code># document.py

@bp.route("/docs/&lt;int:id&gt;", methods=["GET"])
def get_doc(id):
    doc = find_by_id(id)
    current_app.flask_oso.authorize(resource=doc)
    return str(doc)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>authorize()</code> method accepts the same arguments as the <code>is_allowed()</code> method of the <code>oso</code> package (actor, action, and resource), but provides sensible defaults for working with Flask. With our call to <code>set_get_actor()</code>, we set the default actor to the current user. The action defaults to the method of the current request, <code>flask.request.method</code>. We have to provide the resource we want to authorize; in this case, we pass in the <code>Document</code> instance that is being …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This is the first in a series of posts describing how we can debug applications in production using eBPF, without recompilation/redeployment. This post describes how to use <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a> and uprobes to build a function argument tracer for Go applications. This technique is also extendable to other compiled languages such as C++, Rust, etc. The next sets of posts in this series will discuss using eBPF for tracing HTTP/gRPC data, SSL, etc.</p><p>When debugging, we are typically interested in capturing the state of a program. This allows us to examine what the application is doing and determine where the bug is located in our code. A simple way to observe state is to use a debugger to capture function arguments. For Go applications, we often use Delve or gdb.</p><p>Delve and gdb work well for debugging in a development environment, but they are not often used in production. The features that make these debuggers powerful can also make them undesirable to use in production systems. Debuggers can cause significant interruption to the program and even allow mutation of state which might lead to unexpected failures of production software.</p><p>To more cleanly capture function arguments, we will explore using enhanced BPF (<a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBPF</a>), which is available in Linux 4.x+, and the higher level Go library <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a>.</p><p>Extended BPF (eBPF) is a kernel technology that is available in Linux 4.x+. You can think of it as a lightweight sandboxed VM that runs inside of the Linux kernel and can provide verified access to kernel memory.</p><p>As shown in the overview below, eBPF allows the kernel to run BPF bytecode. While the front-end language used can vary, it is often a restricted subset of C. Typically the C code is first compiled to the BPF bytecode using Clang, then the bytecode is verified to make sure it's safe to execute. These strict verifications guarantee that the machine code will not intentionally or accidentally compromise the Linux kernel, and that the BPF probe will execute in a bounded number of instructions every time it is triggered. These guarantees enable eBPF to be used in performance-critical workloads like packet filtering, networking monitoring, etc.</p><p>Functionally, eBPF allows you to run restricted C code upon some event (eg. timer, network event or a function call). When triggered on a function call we call these functions probes and they can be used to either run on a function call within the kernel (kprobes), or a function call in a userspace program (uprobes). This post focuses on using uprobes to allow dynamic tracing of function arguments.</p><p>Uprobes allow you to intercept a userspace program by inserting a debug trap instruction (<code>int3</code> on an x86) that triggers a soft-interrupt . This is also <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/01/27/how-debuggers-work-part-2-breakpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how debuggers work</a>. The flow for an uprobe is essentially the same as any other BPF program and is summarized in the diagram below. The compiled and verified BPF program is executed as part of a uprobe, and the results can be written into a buffer.</p><div><figure>

  </figure></div><p>Let's see how uprobes actually function. To deploy uprobes and capture function arguments, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> simple demo application. The relevant parts of this Go program are shown below.</p><p><code>main()</code> is a simple HTTP server that exposes a single <em>GET</em> endpoint on <em>/e</em>, which computes Euler's number (<strong>e</strong>) using an iterative approximation. <code>computeE</code> takes in a single query param(<em>iters</em>), which specifies the number of iterations to run for the approximation. The more iterations, the more accurate the approximation, at the cost of compute cycles. It's not essential to understand the math behind the function. We are just interested in tracing the arguments of any invocation of <code>computeE</code>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>To understand how uprobes work, let's look at how symbols are tracked inside binaries. Since uprobes work by inserting a debug trap instruction, we need to get the address where the function is located. Go binaries on Linux use ELF to store debug info. This information is available, even in optimized binaries, unless debug data has been stripped. We can use the command <code>objdump</code> to examine the symbols in the binary:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From the output, we know that the function <code>computeE</code> is located at address <code>0x6609a0</code>. To look at the instructions around it, we can ask <code>objdump</code> to disassemble to binary (done by adding <code>-d</code>). The disassembled code looks like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From this we can see what happens when <code>computeE</code> is called. The first instruction is <code>mov 0x8(%rsp),%rax</code>. This moves the content offset <code>0x8</code> from the <code>rsp</code> register to the <code>rax</code> register. This is actually the input argument <code>iterations</code> above; Go's arguments are passed on the stack.</p><p>With this information in mind, we are now ready to dive in and write code to trace the arguments for <code>computeE</code>.</p><p>To capture the events, we need to register a uprobe function and have a userspace function that can read the output. A diagram of this is shown below. We will write a binary called <code>tracer</code> that is responsible for registering the BPF code and reading the results of the BPF code. As shown, the uprobe will simply write to a perf-buffer, a linux kernel data structure used for perf events.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/9f8b26f88f9b132440ef1b9d48b5a341/app-tracer.svg"><figcaption>High-level overview showing the Tracer binary listening to perf events generated from the App</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we understand the pieces involved, let's look into the details of what happens when we add an uprobe. The diagram below shows how the binary is modified by the Linux kernel with an uprobe. The soft-interrupt instruction (<code>int3</code>) is inserted as the first instruction in <code>main.computeE</code>. This causes a soft-interrupt, allowing the Linux kernel to execute our BPF function. We then write the arguments to the perf-buffer, which is asynchronously read by the tracer.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/87301c7282e8f8270fee2afb9fe85c81/app-trace.svg"><figcaption>Details of how a debug trap instruction is used call a BPF program</figcaption></figure></div><p>The BPF function for this is relatively simple; the C code is shown below. We register this function so that it's invoked every time <code>main.computeE</code> is called. Once it's called, we simply read the function argument and write that the perf buffer. Lots of boilerplate is required to set up the buffers, etc. and this can be found in the complete example <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/trace_example/trace.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMzIiIGhlaWdodD0iMzIiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj4KPHBhdGggZmlsbC1ydWxlPSJldmVub2RkIiBjbGlwLXJ1bGU9ImV2ZW5vZGQiIGQ9Ik0yMC4zMzYgNUg4LjA0OEM2LjkxNjQ4IDUgNiA1LjkxNjQ4IDYgNy4wNDhWMjEuMzg0SDguMDQ4VjcuMDQ4SDIwLjMzNlY1Wk0yMy40MDggOS4wOTZIMTIuMTQ0QzExLjAxMjUgOS4wOTYgMTAuMDk2IDEwLjAxMjUgMTAuMDk2IDExLjE0NFYyNS40OEMxMC4wOTYgMjYuNjExNSAxMS4wMTI1IDI3LjUyOCAxMi4xNDQgMjcuNTI4SDIzLjQwOEMyNC41Mzk1IDI3LjUyOCAyNS40NTYgMjYuNjExNSAyNS40NTYgMjUuNDhWMTEuMTQ0QzI1LjQ1NiAxMC4wMTI1IDI0LjUzOTUgOS4wOTYgMjMuNDA4IDkuMDk2Wk0xMi4xNDQgMjUuNDhIMjMuNDA4VjExLjE0NEgxMi4xNDRWMjUuNDhaIiBmaWxsPSIjNEE0QzRGIi8+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Now we have a fully functioning end-to-end argument tracer for the <code>main.computeE</code> function!

Many aspects of Go, such as nested pointers, interfaces, channels, etc. make this process challenging, but solving these problems allows for another instrumentation mode not available in existing systems. Also, since this process works at the binary level, it can be used with natively compiled binaries for other languages (C++, Rust, etc.). We just need to account for the differences in their respective ABI's.</p><p>BPF tracing using uprobes comes with its own set of pros and cons. It's beneficial to use BPF when we need observability into the binary state, even when running in environments where attaching a debugger will be problematic or harmful (ex. production binaries). The biggest downside is the code required to get even trivial visibility into the application state. While BPF code is relatively accessible, it's complex to write and maintain. Without substantial high-level tooling, it's unlikely this can be used for generic debugging.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/12645e1cb582041085ede1877e97c812/wavingnaut.svg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Go dynamic logging is something we are working on at Pixie.

      <p>I've gotten really into writing parsers lately, and Rust has turned out to be
        the perfect language for that. In the course of my adventures, I came up with
        the following:</p>
      <pre><code><span>fn</span> tokenize<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>code<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> str<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>impl</span> Iterator<span>&lt;</span>Item<span>=</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> str<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>and it really deepened my appreciation for Rust.</p>
      <h2 id="what-does-this-function-do%3F">What does this function do? </h2>
      <p>For those not familiar with parsing, tokenization is the first step of the
        process. It takes a raw code string, like this:</p>
      <pre><code>let a = "foo";
</code></pre>
      <p>and turns it into a linear series of meaningful tokens, like so:</p>
      <pre><code>["let", "a", "=", "\"foo\"", ";"]
</code></pre>
      <p>This phase isn't terribly complicated, but it simplifies the mental model for
        the next pass: constructing an "abstract syntax tree". It removes whitespace
        from the equation, bundles up segments like strings and numbers, and just
        generally makes the code in the next pass cleaner.</p>
      <p>The downside is that, if you perform this as a separate pass, your parser now
        has to iterate over all of the source code <em>twice</em>. This may not be the end of
        the world: tokenizing isn't the most expensive operation. But it isn't ideal,
        so some parsers combine the two passes into a single one, saving cycles at the
        expense of readability.</p>
      <h2 id="what's-going-on-in-the-rust-version%3F">What's going on in the Rust version? </h2>
      <p>I'll copy the signature here again for reference:</p>
      <pre><code><span>fn</span> tokenize<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>code<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> str<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>impl</span> Iterator<span>&lt;</span>Item<span>=</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> str<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>There are several things going on here.</p>
      <p><code>&amp;str</code>, in Rust, is a "string slice". It's effectively a character pointer and a
        length. The contents of the slice are guaranteed to be in valid, alive memory.
        <code>&amp;'a str</code> is a string slice <em>with a lifetime</em>. The lifetime <code>'a</code>, to be
        exact. This lifetime describes a limited span of time in which the
        reference (and the full contents of the slice) are guaranteed to be in valid,
        alive memory. More on this later.</p>
      <p><code>Iterator&lt;Item=&amp;'a str&gt;</code> is an iterator over elements of type <code>&amp;'a str</code>. This
        is a <em>trait</em>, though, not a concrete type. Rust needs a concrete type with a
        fixed size when you're defining something like a function, but luckily we can
        say <code>impl Iterator&lt;Item=&amp;'a str&gt;</code>, which tells Rust, "fill in some type that
        implements <code>Iterator&lt;Item=&amp;'a str&gt;</code>, to be inferred at compile-time". This is
        very helpful because in Rust there are lots and lots of different concrete types
        for <code>Iterator</code>; applying something like a <code>map()</code> or a <code>filter()</code> returns a whole
        new concrete type. So this way, we don't have to worry about keeping the
        function signature up to date as we work on the logic.</p>
      <h2 id="so-what's-so-great-about-all-this%3F">So what's so great about all this? </h2>
      <p>Okay, so we have a function that takes a reference to a string slice and returns
        an iterator over string slices. Why's that special? There are two reasons.</p>
      <h3 id="iterators-let-you-treat-one-pass-like-it's-two">Iterators let you treat one pass like it's two </h3>
      <p>Remember how I said you traditionally have to pick between doing a separate
        tokenization pass, and doing a single pass with all the logic interleaved? With
        an iterator, you can have the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>When this function completes, it hasn't yet iterated over the string. It hasn't
        allocated any kind of collection in memory. It returns a structure that's
        <em>prepared</em> to iterate over the input string slice and produce a sequence of new
        slices. When this value later gets <code>map()</code>ed into something else, or
        <code>filter()</code>ed, or any other <code>Iterator</code> transformations get applied, the stages
        of the process get interleaved, and the "loops" effectively get folded into a
        single one. By doing this, we're able to get the clean abstraction of a
        tokenizing "pass" without the runtime overhead of a second loop!</p>
      <p>But other languages have iterators. Rust's may be extra powerful and ergonomic,
        but they aren't a totally unique feature. The next part is very much unique to
        Rust.</p>
      
      <p>The <code>tokenize()</code> function doesn't allocate any new memory for a collection of
        tokens. That's great. But what may be less obvious is that it <em>also</em> doesn't
        allocate any memory for the tokens themselves! Each string slice representing a
        token is a <em>direct pointer to part of the original string</em>.</p>
      <p>You can do this in C/C++, of course, but there's a danger: if those tokens are
        ever accessed after the original code string has been freed, you'll have a
        memory error.</p>
      <p>For example: let's say you open a file and load the source code from it, and
        store the result in a local variable. Then you <code>tokenize()</code> it and send the
        tokens on to somewhere else outside of the function where the original string
        lived. Voilà, you've got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer">use-after-free error</a>.</p>
      <p>One way to guard against this is by copying each string segment into a <em>new</em>
        string, allocated on the heap, which allows you to safely pass it on after the
        original string is gone. But this comes with a cost: creating, copying, and
        eventually disposing of each of those new strings takes time (and memory). Code
        down the line also has to be aware that it's responsible for de-allocating those
        strings, otherwise they'll leak.</p>
      <p>This is where the magic of lifetimes comes into play.</p>
      <p>Rust prevents the above situation entirely. Normally, though, to accomplish this
        a <code>&amp;str</code> coming into a function from elsewhere must be assumed to be <em>static</em>,
        or to be alive for the entire duration of the program's execution. This is the
        status assigned to, for example, a string literal that you've manually entered
        into your Rust code. Rust doesn't know, in the context of the function, how
        long that reference will be valid, so it must be pessimistic.</p>
      <p><strong>But.</strong> That little <code>'a</code> says: "these things all live for the same span of time". We
        can <em>assert</em> that the original source code string lives at least as long as the
        <em>tokens</em> that reference it. By doing so, Rust can reason about whether or not
        those resulting token references are valid at a given point, and therefore
        doesn't have to assume them to be static! We can do <em>whatever we want</em> with
        those tokens and the compiler will guarantee that they always point to something
        valid, even if the source code is loaded in dynamically at runtime (from a file
        or otherwise). If we find out later via a compiler error that they really do
        need to outlive the source string, then we can copy them ("take ownership") at
        that point. If the compiler doesn't force us to do so, we know we're safe,
        and we know we can continue using the most efficient possible approach,
        <em>fearlessly</em>.</p>
      <p>What we've effectively done is written the most optimistic possible function
        (in terms of memory safety), with no downsides, because the Rust compiler will
        tell us if we're misusing it and force us to then "step down" to whatever level
        of extra accommodation is needed.</p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>
      <p>I've been using (and loving) Rust for about a year and a half now. And there are
        many things to love, but when I got this function working I immediately saw it
        as a microcosm of what really sets the language apart. This is something that
        you <strong>cannot do</strong> both a) this safely and b) this efficiently <strong>in any other
language</strong>. This is the power of Rust.</p>

<p>We have a mechanism that can conceive unhappiness, difficulty changing habits, relationship problems, frustration, anger, and disappointment. We are usually not aware, but it’s happening continuously and in all of us.</p>
<p><strong>It’s us unconsciously telling stories to ourselves.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We tell ourselves stories in order to live…We look for the sermon in the suicide, for the social or moral lesson in the murder of five. We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely, especially if we are writers, by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the “ideas” with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience.”
– <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em><strong>Joan Didion</strong>, The White Album</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good story can entertain, motivate, teach valuable lessons, and solidify good habits.</p>
<p>A bad story can demotivate, cause frustration and anger, and curb our capability to be fully ourselves.</p>
<p>These stories are not necessarily false but usually, they don’t tell the entire truth — just one perspective. Another person could look at the same situation and tell a very different story. Telling ourselves stories is natural — we all do it, all the time. There’s nothing inherently wrong with it. That said <strong><em>if we aren’t aware of this happening, we won’t understand how they shape our mood, actions, happiness, and relationships.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="an-example-of-such-a-story">An example of such a story:</h3>
<p><strong>The event:</strong> You submitted a pull request for review after half a day of work. Another engineer asked you to change half of your code and to increase your test coverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Your story:</em></strong> A nitpicking a**hole commented on every single thing I did in that pull request; I guess he has nothing better to do. I wish people stopped blocking me from making progress. Why are they always making game of me?!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The other engineer’s story:</em></strong> Some terrible code almost went live today; thank god I checked that pull request! Why does it always have to be me to watch quality? It’s so sad it’s only important to me in this whole company…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A bystander’s story:</em></strong> Whoa, that was some tense back-and-forth in the comments of that pull request. I wish people were just nicer to each other; we all want to do a good job at the end of the day, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="roots-of-these-stories">Roots of these stories</h2>
<p>The most common origins of these stories are cognitive biases, our self-image made by / combined with our limiting beliefs, and our fears.</p>
<h3 id="our-self-image-and-limiting-beliefs">Our self-image and limiting beliefs</h3>
<p>Ultimately we all have an idea about what kind of a person we are. This idea subconsciously influences how we think, react, and make decisions. The image is usually closely tied to our fundamental values and worldview. Most of us want to be <em>good persons</em> in the end. What ‘right’ is is defined by these very values and core beliefs.
Our self-image influences the stories we tell ourselves because we’re looking for ways to find justification in our day-to-day experience.</p>
<p>Thus this image can limit our perceived set of options and understanding of the world around us.</p>
<p>Related to the personas in the previous example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m the guy who gets things done (<em>might imply that I think others are slowpokes</em>)</li>
<li>As a professional software engineer I am the sole guardian of quality in the company (<em>might imply that I think others are careless or unprofessional</em>)</li>
<li>I’m the kind of person who cares for others' feelings (<em>might imply that I think others have lower EQ</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course these are simply bits and pieces of the whole image.</p>
<p>In all of the narratives above there are (hopefully unfounded) assumptions, lots of jumping to conclusions and unproductive, limiting language. In this particular situation, this locks the actors in the status quo, lowering the hope for change. It feels like a stalemate unless someone is willing to be more open.</p>
<p>By the way I’ve written a bit about this earlier in the post titled <a href="https://ochronus.online/this-is-how-i-am/"><em>This is how I am</em></a></p>
<h3 id="our-fears">Our fears</h3>
<p>Fear also changes the kind of stories you tell yourself. Living in fear means giving up agency, seeing yourself as a passive spectator or a victim. It means seeing yourself as being controlled by circumstances, the actions of others, or your own emotions. And once the story you tell yourself becomes the story of a victim, you will be more and more likely to think and behave like a victim.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-biases">Cognitive biases</h3>
<p>A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.
They are basically ‘shortcuts’ our brains take so it can increase our mental efficiency by enabling us to make quick decisions without any conscious deliberation.
Cognitive biases impact us in many areas of life, including social situations, memory recall, what we believe, and our behavior.</p>
<p>Some relevant and common cognitive biases from the staggering list of more than 180:</p>
<h4 id="self-serving-bias">Self-serving bias</h4>
<p>Self-serving bias is our tendency to blame external forces when bad things happen and give ourselves credit when good things happen. Although it can mean evading personal responsibility for your actions, self-serving bias is a defense mechanism that protects your self-esteem. In the example above, this means that if your pull request gets thumbs up from everyone, you attribute that to you being a fantastic engineer. On the other hand, if you get three comments asking you to change things, you might see others as nitpickers or your environment to be non-supportive instead of realizing you might have some room for improvement.</p>
<h4 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation bias</h4>
<p>Confirmation bias, also known as confirmatory bias or the “myside bias,” is people’s tendency to seek out information that supports something they already believe. This type of bias affects our critical thinking, causing people to remember the hits and forget the misses — a flaw in human reasoning. People will often cue into things that matter to them (the things that support their own beliefs) and dismiss those that don’t. Think about the other engineer overly obsessed with test coverage.</p>

<p>The tendency to attribute greater weight and accuracy to an authority figure’s opinion is at play here. Authority bias is the tendency to blindly follow or believe the instructions and views of a person in authority. We have a deeply rooted sense of duty to obey authority. How do you react when you get a comment on your pull request from a senior engineer you respect? How about if you get the same comment from a junior who just recently started at the company?</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do-about-it">So what can we do about it?</h2>
<p>Don’t forget that <em>we are the storytellers</em> - we have full control over the stories we make up.
Everything starts with <strong>awareness</strong>.
Stories are part of the software of our brains. They influence how we act, what’s important, and what to do when something goes wrong. But every software program has bugs. Awareness is your first step towards debugging.</p>
<p>Stop from time to time and think about the possibility that the story you’ve just created is nothing more than a story. Consider alternative stories. Try telling the same story from other characters' side, think about what their narrative would look like.</p>
<p>Next time you find yourself in an upsetting situation, consider changing your story. Try this exercise:
Recognize and acknowledge any feelings of fear. Hint: you may need to look underneath your anger!
Ask yourself, what is it about this situation that is so upsetting? What do you believe to be “true” about it that feels threatening to you?
As pretty much anything else, fear can be tackled one step at a time. There are ways to re-learn to say what you mean and to do what you feel is right. The good news here is that self-reinforcement works both ways. Once you’ve practiced a bit and proven to yourself that it works (and that it’s less complicated than you thought), it gets easier to continue doing it.</p>
<p>We also must <strong>allow ourselves to be wrong.</strong> If we want to get closer to objective truths, we have to be able and ready to admit we were wrong, especially in the face of new data. If we can’t admit defeat, it makes us less capable of making discoveries in this world. We can avoid biases by being aware of our belief systems, whether our belief is for a religion, a political ideology, a cultural worldview, etc.. Let’s be open to disconfirmation, and allow ourselves to be wrong.</p>
<p>Self-compassion is an instrumental skill for reducing defensiveness and increasing your self-improvement motivation. It involves being kind and forgiving towards yourself, understanding that you are human and that other humans experience the same sort of experiences and failure and being able to identify uncomfortable thoughts without judging them.</p>

<h3><strong>As part of our partnership with OpenCV, we are launching the best free annotation tool for the computer vision community.</strong></h3>

<p><em>In this post, I will be introducing SuperAnnotate’s new free-to-use desktop app, discuss some of the reasons why we built it, and share more about many of the features which we feel will dramatically increase the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of annotation projects. There is a massive functionality gap between free and commercial image annotation tools. SuperAnnotate Desktop is closing this gap by providing the fastest all-inclusive software tool for computer vision engineers to complete their annotation tasks.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2><strong>1. The World of Free Image Annotation Tools</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of writing a rather long introduction on the universe of free image annotation tools, I will quickly summarize many of the well-written articles, blogs, and websites covering the topic. Probably the most informative website discussing free tools is <a href="https://awesomeopensource.com/"><span>https://awesomeopensource.com/</span></a>, which ranks open source tools based on the number of&nbsp; GitHub stars each tool has received. The list for image annotation tools can be found<a href="https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/annotation-tool"> <span>here</span></a>. According to the list, it becomes apparent that CVAT (managed by Intel) and VOTT (managed by Microsoft) are among the most popular free tools for image annotation. There are several other interesting articles that include CVAT and VOTT among the best annotation tools available for free. Here are a few examples:<a href="https://bohemian.ai/blog/image-annotation-tools-which-one-pick-2020/"> <span>Bohemian.ai</span></a>,<a href="https://www.sicara.ai/blog/2019-09-01-top-five-open-source-annotation-tools-computer-vision"> <span>Sicara.ai</span></a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manual_image_annotation_tools"> <span>Wikipedia</span></a>.</p>
<p>These articles are wonderful resources, and I strongly recommend reading them to learn about the different tools available and even try some of them if you have the time. However, what you soon start to realize is that free tools are lacking in many areas resulting in slow speeds, disjointed project management, and an overall non-intuitive user experience - especially when you consider what we’ve come to expect from software today.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Introducing SuperAnnotate Desktop </strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>The founding team of SuperAnnotate (my brother and I) were PhD students in biomedical imaging and computer vision, respectively. During the course of our PhDs, we spent a considerable amount of time working with images, particularly with annotations. In 2018, free annotation tools were as incredibly inconvenient as they are today, and it was quite painful using them. They were not only extremely slow and clunky, but also lacked many key annotation functionalities. These pains led us to launch SuperAnnotate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since founding SuperAnntotate, we have always been focused on releasing software that is lightning-fast, easy to use, and extremely functional for all types of computer vision tasks. Over the last two years, we’ve worked hard to build what we think is the fastest and most efficient annotation platform for computer vision pipelines. And, as we came from academia, we also wanted to make a version of our platform easily installable and free for anyone, to help eliminate many of the pains my brother and I faced as PhD students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in June we announced our partnership with OpenCV to bring a free annotation tool to the broader computer vision community that is a significant upgrade over the current free tools available.</p>
<p>A few days ago we released software for <strong>Mac</strong>, <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong> users. Despite being the initial release, the software already provides multiple advanced features that will accelerate your labeling process by 3–5x.</p>

<p>We will keep updating our desktop app on a monthly basis and would love to get the community’s feedback on features you all like, as well as the ones that are missing. We’re excited to be a bigger part of the OpenCV community, and to help provide the best computer vision tools to its members.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Eight reasons why you should use SuperAnnotate Desktop&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, I will do a deeper dive into some of the features that make our app unique compared to some of the most popular alternatives. As I mentioned above, the paid version of our platform is focused on delivering lightning-fast speed, robust workflows, and a delightful user experience. We tried to bring that focus (and a few of the features) into our desktop app. Here we go:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: I strongly recommend watching the video below which summarizes all these components.</em></p>

<div data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true"><div><p data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wFYtQY3v14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" xml="lang" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wFYtQY3v14?feature=oembed" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></p></div></div>

<p><strong>3.1 Born out of SuperAnnotate’s Core Platform</strong>&nbsp;—  We’ve spent the last two years and we have invested hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and millions of dollars on the core web version of SuperAnnotate, building what we feel is the fastest and most efficient annotation platform for computer vision. It incorporates feedback from annotators working hundreds of thousands of hours in the web version of our platform as well. This has allowed us to deliver our desktop editor with some of the designs, features, and refinements from our core product offering. We hope the result is a 100% free product that is delightful, feature-rich, and professional grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Advanced polygon tool </strong>— Polygon annotation is often the most time-consuming annotation task. Anyone who has tried free annotation tooling knows how poor the experience can be. We made several additions to traditional polygon tools in order to make manual polygon creation and editing much faster. Some of these features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pen-polygon tool  </em>— use the polygon as a pen making curved annotations much faster</li>
<li><em>Point addition/removal </em>—<em> Add</em> <em>and remove</em> polygon points with just a couple of clicks<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><em>Edit polygon</em> —  Substantially increase the speed of editing polygons with our pen polygon tool&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Share polygon boundaries</em> — draw polygons with shared boundaries 2x faster than traditional tools</li>
<li><em>Polygon move</em><span>/group/delete — select, drag, drop, or delete individual or groups of polygons wherever you want</span></li>
</ul>
These are just some of the features that allow us to reduce polygon annotation times by 20-60% while making polygon annotations significantly more accurate.&nbsp;
<p><strong>3.3 Filtering </strong> —  Most annotation tools lack the ability to filter images. Yet we have found that class filtering has a dramatic impact on speeding up the annotation review process. Through SuperAnnotate’s filtering menu, users can display only images with certain classes they are interested in reviewing, avoiding the need to comb through all of the images and saving tremendous amounts of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Tracking multiple objects between frames</strong> —  Tracking multiple objects between consecutive frames can dramatically improve the annotation experience while also making annotating much faster. Our desktop app allows users to select multiple objects and perform operations such as move, delete, group, copy, paste, and duplicate. Users can copy and duplicate annotations in successive frames while keeping the same attribute ID so that a particular attribute can be tracked through multiple frames easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.5 Huge list of shortcuts</strong> — Gamers and power users of tools like excel and photoshop know how a robust list of shortcuts can both improve the user experience and add considerable speed. That was why we made a huge list of shortcuts for actions like tool selection, on-screen navigation, copy/paste/group/ungroup objects, switching between frames, and others. All shortcuts take place on the left side of the keyboard (similar to gaming), so your right hand can stay focused on the mouse, and your left hand does not have to move while finding the right shortcut.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.6 Labeling Flexibility</strong>  — Current platforms (both free and paid) limit you to one labeling workflow: you set the attributes and then draw the shapes. Oftentimes, it can be significantly more efficient to have different workflows such as drawing shapes first, or copying classes between instances. With SuperAnnotate, we allow for a wide range of labeling workflows, giving users the flexibility they need to be most efficient.</p>
<p><strong>3.7 Classes/attributes/point labels  </strong>— Creating, adding, or deleting classes and attributes is made very simple in the SuperAnnotate desktop app. Users can easily import classes from previous projects saving the time needed to define projects. In addition, we allow users to annotate individual points with free text. This can have multiple uses such as, describing the object by a sentence, giving a tag to the object, or describing the specific point in the polygon (e.g. rear-right wheel).</p>
<p><strong>3.8 Leveling up your annotations</strong> — As your annotation needs increase, you will likely find yourself looking for things like increased automations, ML features, more robust project management, detailed quality assurance, team collaboration, and user roles. You might also find yourself needing outsourced annotation teams. At SuperAnnotate, we can satisfy all of these needs and much more via our core platform. <span>Our core platform leverages ML and workflow-based features to help computer vision teams increase annotation speed by up to 10x, while dramatically improving the quality of training data and increasing the efficiency of managing annotation projects. We also have integrated services on the platform, giving customers the ability to access thousands of professionally managed outsourced annotators armed with our lightning-fast tooling. If you are interested in learning more about our core platform and services, please fill out </span><a href="https://www.superannotate.com/contacts?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=SuperAnnotate_Desktop_Launch" rel="noopener"><span>this form</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><strong>4. Importing annotations from other platforms or open-source tools</strong></h2>
<p>Migrating to SuperAnnotate from other software is something important to our customers. This was a common request from our users as many of them wanted to use our platform to quality check their previous work and transition over from other tools. We’ve made it super easy to import annotated data from other annotation tools using only a few lines of code, which I’ve described below. Then, once in our platform, users can leverage features described above like filtering and advanced …</p></span></p></div></div>

<h3>The Government’s proposed new internet regulator will infringe free speech</h3>



<p>The Government published the Online Harms White Paper in April 2019 and intends to put a Bill before Parliament next year. The proposals aim to make the UK “the safest place in the world to go online”, but they will seriously infringe free speech.</p>



<p>Some of the harms the White Paper identifies are real, including distributing images of child abuse and online activities by terrorists. But these would be better dealt with by simpler legislation and more resources for law enforcement.</p>



<p>However, some of the harms the White Paper describes are vague, such as “unacceptable content” and “disinformation”. These are not fixed but would be determined by a future regulator. This will lead to sweeping censorship. Online Harms does not even properly define “harm”, so the definition risks being outsourced to activists and lobby groups.</p>



<p>A proposed new regulator will even have the power to censor lawful content: the government says new regulation should prohibit material “that may directly or indirectly cause harm” even if “not necessarily illegal”. The Government also singled out “offensive material”, as if giving offence is a harm the public should be protected from by the state.</p>



<h3>The proposals move the UK towards the internet laws of China, Russia and Belarus</h3>



<p>The Government’s proposals are partly inspired by Germany’s 2017 “NetzDG” internet law, but Human Rights Watch has called for Germany to scrap the law, saying it “turns internet companies into censors”. President Lukashenko of Belarus, Vladimir Putin’s United Russia Party and the Venezuelan government have cited NetzDG as the model for their online laws.</p>



<p>Our government’s plans also bear a worrying similarity to Beijing’s internet censorship policies. Beijing censors “rumours” because they cause “social harms”. Our government’s proposals describe “disinformation” as “harmful”, and will make “content which has been disputed by reputable fact-checking services less visible to users”, forcing companies to promote “authoritative news sources”. This contradicts our government’s claim that “the regulator will not be responsible for policing truth and accuracy online”.</p>



<p>While the authors of the White Paper believe their proposals will mean more “tolerance” and less “hate”, they will likely have the opposite effect, as people respond angrily to censorship and conspiracy theorists enjoy the cachet of being banned by the state.</p>



<p>In this briefing we outline the Government’s Online Harms plans and explain why they are a danger to freedom of speech. Later this year, the Free Speech Union will propose alternative regulation to protect the vulnerable without jeopardising free speech.</p>

<p><em>FSU research papers are designed to promote discussion of free speech issues. As with all FSU publications, the views expressed are those of the author(s) and not those of the FSU, its directors, Advisory Councils or other senior staff.</em></p>

<p>Within the past few years I’ve really ramped up the number of books I’ve read. There was a lull after university where I had just finished four years worth of studying and wanted nothing more just to relax, but the demands of starting a new career and moving to a new city kept me more busy than ever. During the evenings of the first couple years of my first job I spent them working towards qualifications that I needed to advance in my field. This bled into the weekend, and I found myself with little time to do much else.</p>



<p>But then I finished all that. Suddenly, outside of the occasional late day at the office, I had a lot of free time outside my 9-5. I spent a lot of time just sitting on Reddit and YouTube. Way too much time. It was a bit ridiculous, to be honest – I live in New York City and had every opportunity at my fingertips. Once I realized this, I started readapting my habits to things that I actually enjoyed. The first novel that I read (and probably the first I had read voluntarily in years) was George Orwell’s 1984. I was inspired to read it based on the current events of the world, and found it ominously on point.</p>



<p>I find it curious how so many people are anti-ebook for reasons like “real books are just better!”. Ironically a significant portion of people sharing this opinion that I’ve spoken to struggle to name the last real book that they read. I say this lovingly, as I was absolutely one of those people. One day while walking through the SoHo Amazon 4-Star store, I bought a Kindle Oasis on a whim. It was close to my birthday and I thought it might be easier to haul around with me through the city and on the subway. For once, an impulse purchase was the right choice. I now bring my Kindle everywhere I with a full with a library the width of a single book and a fifth of the thickness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the discounted $2 books from Amazon’s daily newsletters and the Libby service through the New York Public Library, I always have a story on the go. I downloaded Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five before a long flight and was immersed until I landed. Periodically I receive a push notification from Libby on my phone letting me know the high demand book I put on hold two weeks ago is available to borrow – usually requiring me to hit the “deliver later” button because I’m already engulfed in something else.</p>



<p>Herein lies the subject of this post. As the books build up and the GoodReads wishlist expands, I’m finding myself more distraught about when am I ever going read all these books! I was forced to send a large chunk of my physical books to Goodwill when I moved into a cramped NY studio apartment, but I still have a couple shelves worth of books bought years ago that still have perfect spines from never being open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the books I’ve read lately can be found on those listicles of “250 of the Best Classic/Modern/Fiction/Whatever Books” you see online. Even if I were to read a book a week, it would be years before there weren’t any titles left that people would say “I can’t believe you haven’t read _____!” to me. And while reading all those books, there would be at least a few books to enter the public zeitgeist that everyone was talking about while I was reading the classics. I haven’t yet read The Catcher in the Rye, a book that has been on my reading list for years, and who knows when I’ll get to it.</p>



<p>One of my favorite parts about finishing a book is getting to join in on the discussions on Reddit, Goodreads or even in person in the rare case. It’s like getting into an exclusive club, if you’re like me an avoid spoilers at all costs before reading or watching something new. While it’s always nice to have some of my opinions reaffirmed by others, it’s also interesting to see situations where I totally despised a character that apparently everyone else loved and vice versa. Adding to distress is knowing there are countless threads and discussions that I will avoid until the end of time solely because I’ll never read the books in their title.</p>



<p>I enjoy reading books because it’s rewarding. It feels like a much more productive hobby than aimlessly refreshing social media or doom scrolling through the news. It’s an escape from everyday life and it’s amazing how words on a page can evoke emotions in you as you connect with characters and settings. I’ve been forced to consider perspectives or situations that I would never come across in real life and I feel like a more well rounded person for it. I’m sad to think about all the “unknown unknowns” that exist in the minds of the world’s greatest authors which I’ll never be exposed to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are worse problems in the world to have. But it’s still something that irks me each time I finish a book and start scrolling through my Kindle library for the next one. Even if I were to quit my job and laze at the beach reading all day, I’d hardly put a dent in the vast expanse of available literature before I went broke or dried up into a raisin in the sun. I’m writing this to look back on. I’m writing this so that the next time I find myself an hour into a YouTube hole I might consider jumping back into my current read instead. I’m writing this to make a positive change in behavior, however slight, and appreciate the free time I do have to read books that much more.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The intent of the <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/keywords/brazil/">Brazilian</a> President, Jair Bolsonaro, of privatizing the Brazilian post office is known for a while now. But if it was looking like just a far away idea until some weeks ago, could be closer than ever to get out of the paper after the nomination of a new president for the Correios last week. </p>



<p>Understand the whole story about the change of presidency in Correios:</p>



<ul><li>“<a href="https://labsnews.com/en/ecommerce/correios-president-exits-the-organization/">Correio’s President exits the organization</a>“</li><li>“<a href="https://labsnews.com/en/economy/bolsonaro-announces-new-correios-president/">Bolsonaro announces new Correio’s president</a>“</li></ul>



<p>While the ex-president didn’t agree with the privatization idea, the General Floriano Peixoto, the new president in charge of the Brazilian post office, is more opened to the possibility, and that’s what is keeping Amazon and <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/why-the-nine-year-rise-of-aliexpress-means-big-plans-for-latin-american-ecommerce/">Alibaba’s</a> attention. </p>



<p>According to the Brazilian news site O Dia, the global giants are already studying the possibility to buy the Correios if it really happens someday.  The main reason for the two companies is very simple: <strong>to improve logistics in Brazil</strong>. </p>



<p>Since the companies are not interested in the postal service offered by Correios, another possibility on the table is that they could buy it in a partnership with some national bank, according to O Dia. </p>



<p>The end of this story we cannot know for now, but an important new chapter for cross-border e-commerce in Brazil can be just about to begin. </p>



<p>Know more about Amazon and AliExpress in Brazil: </p>

<p>Stories of Chinese Intelligence Firms leveraging <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3691999">Big Data Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/inside-us-china-espionage-war/595747/">Social Media Platforms</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53544505">LinkedIn, </a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/china-ai-surveillance/614197/">Mobile Devices</a>, <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/Chapter%202,%20Section%203%20-%20China's%20Intelligence%20Services%20and%20Espionage%20Threats%20to%20the%20United%20States.pdf">SIGINT, </a>etc are all over the internet.&nbsp; However the recent stories about the Zhenhua Data Leak in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/express-exclusive/china-watching-big-data-president-kovind-pm-narendra-modi-opposition-leaders-chief-justice-of-india-zhenhua-data-information-technology-6594861/">Indian Express</a> caught our attention and we decided to leverage our ShadowMap platform to get some more insight on the Zhenhua Data operation.</p>
<p>After spending several days deep into this rabbit hole of vague corporations, a wide range of collection systems, some really interesting correlation use-cases – we’ve been able to put together a fairly comprehensive image of the Zhenhua Data operation.</p>
<p>While on the surface Zhenhua Data seems to be “just another” firm capturing, processing and selling publicly available information, the story changes rapidly once you look beyond the surface.</p>
<p>This blog post covers four key sections: <strong>Data Collection</strong>, <strong>Data Correlation</strong>, <strong>Identified</strong> <strong>Targets</strong>, <strong>Conclusion.</strong></p>
<h3>Zhenhua Data &amp; Affiliates</h3>
<p>According to the Zhenhua Data website (which has been taken offline, but is still accessible via ShadowMap) – “Zhenhua Data focuses on integrating overseas data and information to provide services for domestic institutions”. In-addition to Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co., Ltd. (china-revival.com) that has already received wide-spread coverage, we also found the involvement of Weiju (aggso.com) &amp; SocialDataMax (socialdatamax.com).</p>
<p>Weiju, started out as a “location-based, instant messaging application that enables users to chat with nearby strangers.”, however the last update on its website (in 2015) mentions “Public opinion monitoring and early warning”, “Communication analysis statistics”, etc.</p>
<p>There are also several mentions of the underlying platforms being developed by “Beijing Juwei Hezhi Information Technology Co., Ltd.”, which has a very limited public presence but is listed online as “Juwei Hezhi is a company that analyzes social media big data”.</p>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Zhenhua Data has a large number of platforms that are used for data collection. These include platforms monitoring your standard social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, VK, Instagram etc. They also monitor a wide range of media outlets, news websites, news aggregators such as Reddit, etc.</p>
<p>In-addition to this, they also seem to have private sources of data such as near real-time movement of warships, satellite tracking, troop movements, etc. More so we were able to find references to private feeds that have access to data from “affiliate apps &amp; websites”, but have not been able to discover or access these portals directly.</p>
<p>Some examples of the public data collection systems that are publicly accessible:</p>
<p><b>LinkedIn – </b>This particular system is configured to continuously search LinkedIn for a range of keywords and then downloads the matching profiles, photos, etc.</p>

Another interesting note here, a lot of the accounts being monitored are related to US Army recruitment and active duty forces.</p>

<p>While some of the Data Collection systems may seem like they would be part of the scope of any average social media big data company, the use-cases and correlations that we have been able to discover are where it really gets interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Big Data Military Intelligence System</strong></p>
<p>One of the early systems that our platform discovered that is directly linked to Zhenhua Data. This platform certainly tells a different story from the “social media monitoring” cover that has been used. The platform seems to have 4 modules: <strong>Internet Information Collection System</strong>, <strong>Big Data Cleaning &amp; Processing System</strong>, <strong>Foreign Army Internet Intelligence System</strong> &amp; <strong>Key Group Monitoring and Analysis System</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Real-time War Ship Monitoring &amp; Correlation Platform</strong></p>
<p>This platform allows for tracking near real-time movements of both commercial and military naval ships. In-addition, it can correlate a wide range of information such as Social Media information of the crew on-board each vessel, photos and videos from individuals and official social media accounts, news stories, weapons manifests, historical location data, etc.</p>
<p>The strike chain functionality tracks key personnel as well, which are in-turn related with the much talked about OKIDB (Overseas Key Information Database), which allows you to get more relevant and correlated data about each individual target.</p>

<p><b>Some of the other systems which are online but not accessible since they are behind login pages:</b></p>

<h3><strong>Identified</strong> <strong>Targets</strong></h3>
<p>The OKIDB has been covered in-depth by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/express-exclusive/china-watching-indian-politicians-big-data-hybrid-cyber-warfare-shenzhen-information-technology-6594805/">several</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-firm-harvests-social-media-posts-data-of-prominent-americans-and-military/2020/09/14/b1f697ce-f311-11ea-8025-5d3489768ac8_story.html">media</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/14/zhenhua-data-full-list-leak-database-personal-details-millions-china-tech-company">organisations</a> that have dissected the list of targets in detail. Generally speaking the OKIDB seems to contain information about anybody that has any level of influence or is affiliated with any such person. The influence is determined on the basis of social media relationships, news mentions, face recognition in public photographs, etc.</p>
<p>We also found several target keyword lists that are actively being used as part of the data collection platforms and seem to be focusing on a wide range of keywords related to Hong Kong. These include key events such as “2019 Prince Edward station attack”, famous protestors such as “Black super brother”, phrases such as “Trying to decrypt” and hundreds of political individuals on both sides.</p>

<h3><b>Conclusion to the Zhenhua Data Story</b></h3>
<p>After studying the ShadowMap reports for&nbsp;Zhenhua Data, we are reasonably certain that everything we have seen so far is only scratching the surface of the Data Collection and Internet Intelligence Systems in place.</p>
<p>While most folks brush off concerns around social media monitoring, as the “price of admission”, privacy and security professionals understand the true risks and have been raising warnings for years. From something as simple as when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases">Fitbit tracking app Strava disclosed the location of secret US army bases</a>, to modernising and automating the process of gaining “kompromat” on a target.</p>
<p>The technology and capabilities we have seen with Zhenhua Data show us that the dystopian future that George Orwell’s 1984 warned us about, is here to stay. From silencing political opponents, quashing protests, spreading misinformation to influence elections or attacking enemy militaries – Big Data Surveillance systems will continue to have a significant role to play in geo-politics.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- same but the player list is a CSV string</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but the player list is a JSONB array</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>jsonb_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but returns a nice JSONB object like so:</span>
<span>-- { guild1: [ playerid1, playerid2, .. ], .. }</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>jsonb_object_agg</span><span>(</span><span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>players</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>q</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

<hr>

<p>Many users of Python deprioritize performance in favor of soft benefits like ergonomics, business value, and simplicity. Users who prioritize performance typically end up on faster compiled languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>One group of users is left behind, though. The scientific computing community has lots of raw data they need to process, and would very much like performance. Yet, they struggle to move away from Python, because of network effects, and because Python’s beginner-friendliness is appealing to scientists for whom programming is not a first language. So, how can Python users achieve some fraction of the performance that their C++ and Java friends enjoy?</p>
<p>In practice, scientific computing users rely on the NumPy family of libraries e.g.&nbsp;NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CuPy, JAX, etc.. The sheer proliferation of these libraries suggests that the NumPy model is getting something right. In this essay, I’ll talk about what makes NumPy so effective, and where the next generation of Python numerical computing libraries (e.g.&nbsp;TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) seems to be headed.</p>
<h2 id="data-good-pointers-bad">Data good, pointers bad</h2>
<p>A pesky fact of computing is that computers can compute far faster than we can deliver data to compute on. In particular, data transfer <em>latency</em> is the Achille’s heel of data devices (both RAM and storage). Manufacturers disguise this weakness by emphasizing improvements in data transfer <em>throughput</em>, but latency continues to stagnate. Ultimately, this means that any chained data access patterns, where one data retrieval must be completed before the next may proceed, are the worst case for computers.</p>
<p>These worst-case chained data access patterns are unfortunately quite common – so common that they have a name you may be familiar with: a pointer.</p>
<p>Pointers have always been slow. In the ’80s and ’90s, our hard drives were essentially optimized record players, with a read head riding on top of a spinning platter. These hard drives had physical limitations: The disk could only spin so fast without shattering, and the read head was also mechanical, limiting its movement speed. Disk seeks were slow, and the programs that were most severely affected were databases. Some ways that databases dealt with these physical limitations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using binary trees (requiring <span>\(\log_2 N\)</span> disk seeks), B-trees with a much higher branching factor <span>\(k\)</span> were used, only requiring <span>\(\log_k N\)</span> disk seeks.</li>
<li>Indices were used to query data without having to read the full contents of each row.</li>
<li>Vertically-oriented databases optimized for read-heavy workloads (e.g.&nbsp;summary statistics over one field, across entire datasets), by reorganizing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA">arrays of structs to structs of arrays</a>. This maximized effective disk throughput, since no extraneous data was loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, compute speed is roughly <span>\(10^5 - 10^6\)</span> times faster than in 1990. Today, RAM is roughly <span>\(10^5\)</span> times faster than HDDs from 1990. I was amused and unsurprised to find that Raymond Hettinger’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg">excellent talk on the evolution of Python’s in-memory <code>dict</code> implementation</a> plays out like a brief history of early database design. Time, rather than healing things, has only worsened the compute-memory imbalance.</p>
<h2 id="numpys-optimizations">NumPy’s optimizations</h2>
<h3 id="boxing-costs">Boxing costs</h3>
<p>In many higher-level languages, raw data comes in boxes containing metadata and a pointer to the actual data. In Python, the PyObject box holds reference counts, so that the garbage collector can operate generically on all Python entities.</p>
<p>Boxing creates two sources of inefficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>The metadata bloats the data, reducing the data density of our expensive memory.</li>
<li>The pointer indirection creates another round trip of memory retrieval latency.</li>
</ul>
<p>A NumPy array can hold many raw data within a single PyObject box, <em>provided that all of those data are of the same type</em> (int32, float32, etc.). By doing this, NumPy amortizes the cost of boxing over multiple data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_dive_mcts">my previous investigations into Monte Carlo tree search</a>, a naive UCT implementation performed poorly because it instantiated millions of UCTNode objects whose sole purpose was to hold a handful of float32 values. In the optimized UCT implementation, these nodes were replaced with NumPy arrays, reducing memory usage by a factor of 30.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-lookup-function-dispatch-costs">Attribute lookup / function dispatch costs</h3>
<p>Python’s language design forces an unusually large amount of pointer chasing. I mentioned boxing as one layer of pointer indirection, but really it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Python has no problem handling the following code, even though each of these multiplications invokes a completely different implementation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mixed_list = [1, 1.0, 'foo', ('bar',)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for obj in mixed_list:
...     print(obj * 2)

2
2.0
'foofoo'
('bar', 'bar')</code></pre>
<p>Python accomplishes this with a minimum of two layers of pointer indirection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look up the type of the object.</li>
<li>Look up and execute the <code>__mul__</code> function from that type’s operation registry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional layers of pointer indirection may be required if the <code>__mul__</code> method is defined on a superclass: the chain of superclasses must be traversed, one pointer at a time, until an implementation is found.</p>
<p>Attribute lookup is similarly fraught; <code>@property</code>, <code>__getattr__</code>, and <code>__getattribute__</code> provide users with flexibility that incurs pointer chasing overhead with something as simple as executing <code>a.b</code>. Access patterns like <code>a.b.c.d</code> create exactly the chained data access patterns that are a worst-case for data retrieval latency.</p>
<p>To top it all off, merely <em>resolving</em> the object is expensive: there’s a stack of lexical scopes (local, nonlocal, then global) that are checked in order to find the variable name. Each check requires a dictionary lookup, another source of pointer indirection.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: “We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection… except for the problem of too many levels of indirection”. The NumPy family of libraries deals with this indirection, not by removing it, but again by sharing its cost over multiple data.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; homogenous_array = np.arange(5, dtype=np.float32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; multiply_by_two = homogenous_array * 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(multiply_by_two)
array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8.], dtype=float32)</code></pre>
<p>Sharing a single box for multiple data allows NumPy to retain the expressiveness of Python while minimizing the cost of the dynamism. As before, this works because of the additional constraint that all data in a NumPy array must have identical type.</p>
<h2 id="the-frontier-jit">The Frontier: JIT</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve seen that NumPy doesn’t solve any of Python’s fundamental problems when it comes to pointer overhead. Instead, it merely puts a bandaid on the problem by sharing those costs across multiple data. It’s a pretty successful strategy – in my hands (<a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/vectorized_pagerank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_dive_mcts">2</a>), I find that NumPy can typically achieve 30-60x speedups over pure Python solutions to dense numerical code. However, given that C code typically achieves <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/data_oriented_python/(https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gcc.html)">100-200x performance</a> over pure Python on dense numerical code (common in scientific computing), it would be nice if we could further reduce the Python overhead.</p>
<p>Tracing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JITs</a> promise to do exactly this. Roughly, the strategy is to trace the execution of the code and record the pointer chasing outcomes. Then, when you call the same code snippet, reuse the recorded outcomes! NumPy amortizes Python overhead over multiple data, and JIT amortizes Python overhead over multiple function calls.</p>
<p>(I should note that I’m most familiar with the tracing JITs used by TensorFlow and JAX. <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/">PyPy</a> and <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> are two alternate JIT implementations that have a longer history, but I don’t know enough about them to treat them fairly, so my apologies to readers.)</p>
<p>Tracing unlocks many wins typically reserved for compiled languages. For example, once you have the entire trace in one place, operations can be fused together (e.g., to make use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set">fused multiply-add instructions</a> common to most modern computers), memory layouts can be optimized, and so on. TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graph_optimization">Grappler</a> is one such implementation of this idea. Traces can also be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">walked backwards</a> to automatically compute derivatives. Traces can be compiled for different hardware configurations, so that the same Python code executes on CPU, GPU, and TPU. JAX can <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html#Auto-vectorization-with-vmap">autovectorize traces</a>, adding a batch dimension to all operations. Finally, a trace can be exported in a language-agnostic manner, allowing a program defined in Python to be executed in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Javascript</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving">C++</a>, or more.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a catch to all this. NumPy can amortize Python overhead over multiple data, but only if that data is the same type. JIT can amortize Python overhead over multiple function calls, but only if the function calls would have resulted in the same pointer chasing outcomes. Retracing the function to verify this would defeat the purpose of JIT, so instead, TensorFlow/JAX JIT uses array shape and dtype to guess at whether a trace is reusable. This heuristic is necessarily conservative, rules out otherwise legal programs, often requires unnecessarily specific shape information, and doesn’t make any guarantees against mischievous tinkering. Furthermore, data-dependent tracing is a known issue (<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html">1</a>, <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#python-control-flow-+-JIT">2</a>). I worked on <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/07/autograph-converts-python-into-tensorflow-graphs.html">AutoGraph</a>, a tool to address data-dependent tracing. Still, the engineering benefits of a shared tracing infrastructure are too good to pass up. I expect to see JIT-based systems flourish in the future and iron out their user experience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The NumPy API’s specifically addresses Python’s performance problems for the kinds of programs that scientific computing users want to write. It encourages users to write code in ways that minimize pointer overhead. Coincidentally, this way of writing code is a fruitful abstraction for tracing JITs targeting vastly parallel computing architectures like GPU and TPU. (Some people argue that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3321441">machine learning is stuck in a rut</a> due to this NumPy monoculture.) In any case, tracing JITs built on top of …</p></div></div></div>

<p><small>17 Sep 2020</small></p><p>This is not going to be my normal kind of post, it’s not very focused, and
going to be a bit rambley, as I talk about a problem I thought about one day.</p>
<p>Magic: The Gathering is a card game where players construct decks, typically of
60 cards plus a 15 card sideboard, for 75 cards total.</p>
<p>Periodically, the company that makes the game,
Wizards of the Coast (WotC) publishes a
list of decks that did well recently.
Just recently they
<a href="https://magic.gg/news/esports-update-grand-finals-formats-decklist-hub-and-more">announced</a> that they were going to start doing this for their most recent digital offering of the game.
Stay with me! This isn’t a post about card games.
This list, however, is doctored: they want the data shown to be broad and not repetitive, so they perform some amount of deduplication on the data.
This means that if two “similar” decks do well, only one will be shown in the dump.
The linked article outlines what is meant by “similar:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will be publishing lists from Standard Ranked, Traditional Standard Ranked, Historic Ranked, and Traditional Historic Ranked play queues. Like we do for Magic Online Leagues, we will be posting an example list for each category of deck that share a minimum number of cards: at least 55 of 75 cards (across main deck and sideboard) shared in Traditional (best of three games, or Bo3) or at least 45 of 60 main deck cards shared in best of one (Bo1). All lists published will have won at least six consecutive matches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seemed to me like an interesting problem!
Given a raw set of decks that did well, how could we produce such a
deduplicated set of decks?</p>
<p>At a high level, we might envision the set of decks as a bunch of points in some
space, where points are closer together if the decks are more “similar” (for some
meaning of “similar” we haven’t made precise yet).</p>
<p><img src="http://justinjaffray.com/images/decks1.png">
</p>
<p>With a solution being a set of decks which “cover” the set of all other decks
(for some meaning of “cover” we haven’t made precise yet).</p>
<p><img src="http://justinjaffray.com/images/decks2.png">
</p>
<p>To be slightly more precise, given a set \(D\) of “decks,” we want to find a
minimal set \(D^\prime \subseteq D\) such that every \(d \in D\) is
“sufficiently close” to some \(d^\prime \in D^\prime\).</p>
<p>Let’s define what we mean by “deck” and “sufficiently close.” We can represent
decks as maps from the set of cards \(C\) to some integer \(n \in \mathbb N\)
denoting how many copies of a given card are in the deck.
We might also think of this as an \(\mathbb N\) vector indexed by \(C\), which can be denoted \(\mathbb N ^ C\).
That’s all to say, you should think of one of these decks as just a sequence of numbers denoting how many of a given card were included,
where each index corresponds to a particular card:
\[
\langle
\ldots, 4 \ldots, 2, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 4, \ldots
\rangle
\]
The sequence is finite, since there’s a finite number of Magic cards (about twenty thousand).</p>
<p>For “closeness” of two decks, per the statement above from WotC we are interested in the <em>total number of different cards between them</em>.
That is, the distance between two decks \(a\) and \(b\) is the sum
of the absolute difference of the quantity of each card:
\[
|a - b| = \sum_{c \in C} \left| a_c - b_c \right|.
\]
This way of measuring distance is pretty natural, and satisfies some
nice properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(|a - b| = 0\) if and only if \(a = b\),</li>
<li>\(|a - b| = |b - a|\) (symmetry), and</li>
<li>\(|a - c| \le |a - b| + |b - c|\) (triangle inequality).</li>
</ol>
<p>A notion of distance that satisfies properties 1, 2, and 3 happens to be called a <em>metric</em>,
and a set combined with a metric on that set is called a <em>metric space</em>.
This particular metric we’ve stumbled on is actually well known, and is called
the \(\ell_1\)-norm.</p>
<p>We’ll be a little abstract here, but when you hear “metric” you should just
think “way of thinking about distance.”
If you look at the three properties, they’re all pretty natural things you’d want from a measure of “distance:”</p>
<ol>
<li>says the only thing “zero distant” from a thing is the thing itself,</li>
<li>says that \(a\) is exactly as far from \(b\) as \(b\) is from \(a\), and</li>
<li>says two things can’t be further away than the sum of their distances to a third thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of metrics people use for various things.
Another one is the \(\ell_2\)-norm, which you might also know as Euclidean distance:
if you have two points in Euclidean space and draw a straight line between
them, their \(\ell_2\)-distance is the length of that line.
In two-dimensional space,
\[
|a - b| = \sqrt{(a_x - b_x)^2 + (a_y - b_y)^2}
\]
Which is just the Pythagorean theorem.
For our problem we’re concerned with the \(\ell_1\)-distance, as described above.</p>
<p>Why bother introducting this abstraction?
Well, mostly I just thought it was kind of neat, but
I think making this kind of hop upwards the abstraction hierarchy can be useful to understand problems sometimes,
because it lets us make concrete the link between our actual problem, \(\ell_1\)-distance of 20,000-dimensional \(\mathbb N\)-points, weird, scary, hard to visualize, to
a problem which is easier to conceptualize: \(\ell_2\)-distance of two-dimensional points.</p>
<p><img src="http://justinjaffray.com/images/decks2.png">
</p>
<p>Seen this way, this kind of picture isn’t just a helpful mental model,
but it actually has a real, quantifiable link to the original problem we were trying to solve.</p>
<p>When thinking about this problem, it’s not completely accurate, but it’s not
too bad to just imagine the \(\ell_2\) picture above.</p>
<p>Remember that the thing we’re primarily interested in is going to be
all the points “sufficiently close” to a given point,
where “sufficiently close” means “has distance less than some \(r\).”
It turns out this thing has a name, the <em>(closed) ball of radius \(r\) centered at \(p\)</em> is
the set of points \(x\) satisfying \(|x - p| \le r\).
A “ball” is basically what you expect in most contexts, in 2D space, under the \(\ell_2\)-norm (our diagram above)
a ball is a (filled in) circle.
In 3D it’s a sphere.
In “deck-space,” it’s the set of decks you can make from \(p\) by adding and removing at most \(r\) cards.</p>
<p>This lets us rephrase our problem a bit more generally.
Given a metric space \(M\), a finite set of points \(P \subseteq M\), and a radius \(r\),
we want to find a set \(P^\prime \subseteq P\) such that every \(p \in P\)
is within some ball of radius \(r\) centered at some \(p^\prime \in P^\prime\).</p>
<p>So, can we solve <em>this</em> problem, in a <em>general</em> metric space, efficiently?
It turns out we actually can’t!
Why did I bother going down this road of generalization if it was going to lead to a dead-end?
Well, it’s the road I took when thinking about this problem and it’s my blog,
and also it’s actually easy to show that the problem at this level of generality is NP-hard.
As a reminder, to show this is NP-hard for metric spaces in general, we must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix some metric space, and</li>
<li>show that computing the size of the cover is NP-hard by showing that an
efficient solution to <em>that</em> would allow us to solve some other NP-hard
problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider a graph \(G\):</p>
<p><img src="http://justinjaffray.com/images/petersen.png">
</p>
<p>The <em>dominating set problem</em> is this:
given a graph \(G = (V, E)\), find a set \(V^\prime\) of vertices such that every \(v \in V\) is adjacent to some
\(v^\prime \in V^\prime\).
That is, we want to choose some set of vertices that “cover” all other vertices: every other vertex is adjacent to one we chose.
Finding a minimum dominating set is a well known NP-complete problem,
and already smells similar to our problem!</p>
<p>If we define a binary function on the vertices of \(G\):
\[
d(a, b) = \text{the length of the shortest path between $a$ and $b$},
\]
it turns out \(d\) is a metric (check this yourself, it’s easy)!</p>
<p>If we take this metric and set \(r\) to 1, we’ve exactly recreated the
dominating set problem, which, being NP-complete, means our problem
in a general metric space is also NP-complete.
While this doesn’t mean that our original problem about Magic decks is
NP-complete (though it’s evidence that suggests this might be the case),
it does mean that any algorithm that <em>only</em> uses the properties of a metric space
probably doesn’t have an efficient solution.</p>
<p>When asked about this, my friend <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~fshinko/">Forte</a>
found a nice reduction from 3SAT to the deck problem if \(r\) is at least four.
The gist of it is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given an instance of 3SAT with \(n\) variables \(\{v_1, \ldots, v_n\}\), let your set of “cards” be
\(\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\} \cup \{y_1, \ldots, y_n\}\).</li>
<li>For each clause \(a \vee b \vee c\), take the vector that is 1 at \(x_i\) for the variable for \(a\) if \(a\) is not negated, and -1 if it is, and the same for \(b\) and \(c\).</li>
<li>For each variable \(v_i\), add three vectors that are all 2 at \(y_i\), and -1, 0, and 1 at \(x_i\), respectively (the choice of the one at 1 or -1 will correspond to whether we take that variable to be true or not, and the 0 one is there to ensure you need to take at least one of them).</li>
<li>This set of decks has a cover of size \(n\) (for radius 4) if and only if the 3SAT instance was satisfiable (the numbers can be tweaked to support radii larger than 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>If \(r\) is one then there actually <em>is</em> an efficient solution,
because in this case the adjacency graph is bipartite, and a dominating set of a
bipartite graph can be found in polynomial time.
I don’t know if there’s an efficient solution when \(r\) is two or three.</p>
<p>Ok, well, we are probably not going to find an efficient solution then, how about an
inefficient solution?
Wizard of the Coast must have <em>some</em> way of doing that, since they regularly
publish such deduplicated decklists.
The likely answer, I’d guess, is that they don’t fret about finding the minimum cover,
and just do something like “output uncovered decks until none remain.”
Or possibly there are just few enough decklists that they have an excel spreadsheet
or something that makes sure their stated invariants are upheld. Unsure!
If you work at WotC and somehow came across this post I’d be curious to learn the real answer.</p>
<p>I can’t say how they actually do it, but there are plenty of heuristic methods
for solving this kind of thing that they might employ if you’re actually
interested in finding a good solution.</p>

<h2>1. A big single state file is not going to help you.</h2>
<p>When a new user starts with Terraform, it could seem easier to manage all the infrastructure code under one big repository and one big state file (To who doesn’t know what a state file is, check out this page -&gt; <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html">https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html</a>)</p>
<p>However, this design will soon show its downsides and limits.</p>
<p><strong>Why is a mono state file, not a good idea in terms of performance?</strong></p>
<p>One of the reason is that during the ‘terraform plan’ command there’s an action called “refresh”. This step means that Terraform is about to “reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world infrastructure.”<br>
If there’s a big state file with the whole infrastructure mapped and a person wants to change just a single GKE cluster, remove a single EC2 instance or create a new bucket.<br>
Guess what? <strong>It will require the refresh on the whole infrastructure</strong> (and trust me, it will take a while!)</p>
<p><strong>But what about the infrastructure reliability?</strong></p>
<p>What happens if accidentally someone runs ‘terraform destroy’ against that mono state file?<br>
Yes. It’s all gone. You would have to recreate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>What happens if someone uses a new terraform version? (e.g.: from terraform 0.11 to terraform 0.12)<br>
Everyone would have to upgrade the CLI version, and if you’re unlucky, you might also need to update the actual terraform code.<br>
There are other reasons, but I’m sure I’ve made this point clear enough: don’t use a single state file! -.-’</p>
<h2>2. Monorepo is evil.</h2>
<p>Someone  might say: let’s put all together, modules, code, everything in a single repository but in different directories with different state files: brilliant -.-’</p>
<p>Trust me when I say that I’ve seen the worst things with Terraform: repositories with symlinks to share/copy variables in different directories, I’ve seen gigantic mono repositories, terraform files generated from bash scripts and an SQL database, trust me it’s not fancy out there.</p>
<p>Why is a huge repository NOT a good idea in terms of code reliability?<br>
Plain and simple: it doesn’t scale.<br>
Now imagine you’re a small team of 5 engineers, pushing all the infrastructure code together might seem a good idea.<br>
You all have permission to create/remove/edit the terraform code, and this way, you would not have to deal with multiple pipelines, etc.</p>
<p>However after a year, your small team of 5 becomes 100. Other engineers now want to use Terraform to manage their infrastructures (network engineers, DBAs, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, etc.).</p>
<p>It will become tricky (not impossible) to manage permissions, coordinate terraform changes, and create a whole pipeline/automation that can satisfy everyone’s need.</p>
<p>And what if you have used modules inside that single repository?<br>
How are you going to manage modules versions?<br>
A poor repositories structure design generates all these obstacles.</p>
<p>What if you are already there?<br>
My piece of advice is start by moving modules to different repositories.<br>
You can also start to automate testing and tagging on modules.<br></p>
<p>After this first step is done, split your infrastructure into layers, and start to divide the layers inside different repositories managed by the owners of that layer of infrastructure.<br>
It will be painful!<br>
Remember, no pain, no gain!</p>
<h2>3. Don’t run Terraform manually: use pipelines.</h2>
<p>Here too, I’ve seen the worst things. I’ve once worked for a company that used to have a Slack channel where they “locked” Terraform by basically sending messages like “I’m using Terraform” or “terraform locked”: I mean… seriously? “Terraform locked”?  -.-’</p>
<p>Having the right orchestration and automation will help your team to don’t override each other changes.<br>
If you plan to work with pipelines, my advice is to have <em>no</em> concurrent builds and run the automation on tiny parts of the infrastructures.<br>
By doing this, there won’t be long pipelines but quick flows with an effective feedback cycle.</p>
<p><em>Always tag your infrastructure code</em>, and treat it as a real software/application.</p>
<p><em>Run tests.</em> Testing Terraform code might look complicated but there some useful tools out there such as “terratest”.<br>
If you’re comfortable with Go, you can follow Hashicorp’s tutorials about unit testing with Terraform.</p>
<p><em>You should have a tool to handle the CI and another to run the deploy.</em><br>
In my opinion, the desired situation is that the CI tool would push an artifact with the tested Terraform code in it, and the deploy would pick the artifact and deploy it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The perfect way to run Terraform doesn’t exist.<br>
In most cases, it depends on the use case, BUT there are some errors that I’d define common mistakes that everyone should avoid.<br>
Remember: well begun is half done :)</p></div></div>]]>

    <div>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> (command name <code>rg</code>) is a <code>grep</code> tool, but supports search and replace as well. <code>rg</code> is far from a like-for-like alternate for <code>sed</code>, but it has nifty features like multiline replacement, fixed string matching, <code>PCRE2</code> support, etc. This post gives an overview of syntax for substitution and highlights some of the cases where <code>rg</code> is a handy replacement for <code>sed</code>.</p>
<h2 id="global-search-and-replace">Global search and replace<a href="#global-search-and-replace" aria-label="Anchor link for: global-search-and-replace">🔗</a></h2>
<pre><code><span>$ cat ip.txt

</span><span># by default, line number is displayed if output destination is stdout
# by default, only lines that matched the given pattern is displayed

<h2 id="matching-nth-occurrence">Matching Nth occurrence<a href="#matching-nth-occurrence" aria-label="Anchor link for: matching-nth-occurrence">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As seen in previous example, <code>rg</code> will search and replace all occurrences. So, you'll have to be creative with regexp to replace only a specific occurrence per input line.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'see bat hot at but at go gate at sat at but at'

</span><span># replace first occurrence only
# same as: sed 's/\bat\b/[xyz]/'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>N </span><span>'\bat\b(.*)' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'[xyz]$1'</span><span>
see bat hot [xyz] but at go gate at sat at but at

</span><span># same as: sed 's/\bat\b/[xyz]/3'
# the number within {} is N-1 to replace Nth occurrence, for N&gt;1
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>N </span><span>'^((.*?\bat\b){2}.*?)\bat\b' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'$1[xyz]'</span><span>
see bat hot at but at go gate [xyz] sat at but at

</span><span># replace last but Nth occurrence, for N&gt;=0
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>N </span><span>'^(.*)\bat\b((.*\bat\b){3})' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'$1[xyz]$2'</span><span>
see bat hot at but [xyz] go gate at sat at but at
</span></code></pre><br>
<h2 id="in-place-workaround">In-place workaround<a href="#in-place-workaround" aria-label="Anchor link for: in-place-workaround">🔗</a></h2>
<p><code>rg</code> doesn't support in-place option, so you'll have to do it yourself.</p>
<pre><code><span># -N isn't needed here as output destination is a file
# same as: sed -i 's/blue/red/g' ip.txt
</span><span>$ rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>'blue' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'red'</span><span> ip.txt </span><span>&gt;</span><span> tmp.txt </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> mv tmp.txt ip.txt

$ cat ip.txt
dark red, light red
light orange
red sky
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you have <a href="https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/">moreutils installed</a>, then you could use <code>sponge</code> as well.</p>
<pre><code><span>rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>'blue' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'red'</span><span> ip.txt </span><span>|</span><span> sponge ip.txt
</span></code></pre><br>
<h2 id="rust-regex-and-pcre2">Rust regex and PCRE2<a href="#rust-regex-and-pcre2" aria-label="Anchor link for: rust-regex-and-pcre2">🔗</a></h2>
<p>By default, <code>rg</code> uses Rust regular expressions, which is much more featured compared to <code>GNU sed</code>. The main feature not supported is backreference within regexp definition (for performance reasons). See <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.9/regex/index.html">Rust regex documentation</a> for regular expression syntax and features. <code>rg</code> supports Unicode by default.</p>
<pre><code><span># non-greedy quantifier is supported
</span><span>$ s=</span><span>'food land bark sand band cue combat'</span><span>
$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>'foo.*?ba' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'[xyz]'
</span><span>[xyz]rk sand band cue combat

</span><span># unicode support
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>'fox:αλεπού,eagle:αετός' </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>'\p{L}+' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'($0)'
</span><span>(fox)</span><span>:</span><span>(αλεπού),(eagle)</span><span>:</span><span>(αετός)

</span><span># set operator example, remove all punctuation characters except . ! and ?
</span><span>$ para=</span><span>'"hi", there! how *are* you? all fine here.'</span><span>
$ echo </span><span>"$para" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>'[[:punct:]--[.!?]]+' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>''</span><span>
hi there! how are you? all fine here.
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>-P</code> switch will enable <a href="https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/index.html">PCRE2</a> flavor, which has even more tricks. You can also use <code>--engine=auto</code> to allow <code>rg</code> to automatically use <code>PCRE2</code> when needed (for example: useful as an alias for <code>rg</code> command so that it gives performance of Rust engine by default and use <code>PCRE2</code> only when needed).</p>
<pre><code><span># backreference within regexp definition
</span><span>$ s=</span><span>'cocoa appleseed tool speechless'</span><span>
$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>wP </span><span>'([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'{$0}'</span><span>

</span></code></pre><br>
<h2 id="extract-and-modify">Extract and modify<a href="#extract-and-modify" aria-label="Anchor link for: extract-and-modify">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The <code>-r</code> option can be used when <code>-o</code> option is active too. The example shown below is not easy to do with <code>sed</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'0501 035 154 12 26 98234'

</span><span># numbers &gt;= 100 and ignore leading zeros
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>-</span><span>woP </span><span>'0*+(\d{3,})' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'"$1"' </span><span>|</span><span> paste </span><span>-</span><span>sd,
</span><span>"501"</span><span>,</span><span>"154"</span><span>,</span><span>"98234"
</span></code></pre><br>
<h2 id="fixed-string-matching">Fixed string matching<a href="#fixed-string-matching" aria-label="Anchor link for: fixed-string-matching">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Like <code>grep</code>, the <code>-F</code> option will allow fixed strings to be matched, a handy option that I feel every search and replace tool should provide.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ </span><span>printf </span><span>'2.3/[4]*6\nfoo\n5.3-[4]*9\n' </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>F </span><span>'[4]*' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'2'
</span><span>2.3</span><span>/</span><span>26</span><span>
foo
</span><span>5.3</span><span>-</span><span>29
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>-F</code> doesn't extend to replacement section though, so you need <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code> character to represent it literally.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>'a.*{2}-b' </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>F </span><span>'.*{2}' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'+$x\tc'</span><span>
a</span><span>+</span><span>\tc</span><span>-</span><span>b

a</span><span>+</span><span>$x</span><span>\tc</span><span>-</span><span>b
</span></code></pre><br>
<h2 id="multiline-matching">Multiline matching<a href="#multiline-matching" aria-label="Anchor link for: multiline-matching">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Another handy option is <code>-U</code> which enables multiline matching.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'hi there\nhave a nice day\nbye'

</span><span># (?s) flag will allow . to match newline characters as well
</span><span>$ </span><span>printf </span><span>'</span><span>%b</span><span>' "$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>U </span><span>'(?s)the.*ice' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>''</span><span>

</span></code></pre><br>
<h2 id="handling-dos-style-input">Handling dos-style input<a href="#handling-dos-style-input" aria-label="Anchor link for: handling-dos-style-input">🔗</a></h2>
<p><code>rg</code> provides support for dos-style files with <code>--crlf</code> option.</p>
<pre><code><span># same as: sed -E 's/\w+(\r?)$/xyz\1/'
# note that output will retain CR+LF as line ending
# similar to the sed solution, this will work for unix-style input too
</span><span>$ </span><span>printf </span><span>'hi there\r\ngood day\r\n' </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>--</span><span>crlf </span><span>'\w+$' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'xyz'</span><span>

<h2 id="speed-comparison-with-gnu-sed">Speed comparison with GNU sed<a href="#speed-comparison-with-gnu-sed" aria-label="Anchor link for: speed-comparison-with-gnu-sed">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Another advantage of <code>rg</code> is that it is likely to be faster than <code>sed</code>. See <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/">ripgrep benchmark with other grep implementations</a> by the author for a methodological detailed analysis and insights.</p>
<pre><code><span># for small files, initial processing time of rg is a large component

<p>Fuzzing is a software testing method that involves passing malformed
data as input to the program and monitoring it for misbehavior.
Today, fuzzing is one of the most effective ways to find software security problems.
In 2014, Michał Zalewski presented American Fuzzy Lop, the first coverage
guided fuzzer. This started the modern world of fuzzing solutions and
techniques on the market.</p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss libFuzzer, a LLVM utility that allows you to integrate fuzzing
methodology into your libraries, and briefly introduce techniques to maximize the effectiveness
of catching problems.</p>



<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a>
is part of the <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>
package. It allows you to integrate the
coverage-guided fuzzer logic into your C / C++ application. A crucial feature
of libFuzzer is its close integration with
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html">Sanitizer Coverage</a>
and bug detecting sanitizers, namely:
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">Address Sanitizer</a>,
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html">Leak Sanitizer</a>,
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">Memory Sanitizer</a>,
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html">Thread Sanitizer</a>
and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">Undefined Behavior Sanitizer</a>.
The use of these projects
ensures that a wide range of memory corruption bugs and undesired
application behavior are detected. A few examples of these are: Heap/Stack/Global Out Of Bounds,
Use After Free, Use After Return, Uninitialized Memory Reads, Memory Leaks
or Uninitialized Mutex Use.</p>

<p>Everything is provided with a relatively low performance and memory overhead.
The project requires merely a functional LLVM 5.0 toolchain or newer (release date: 07 Sep 2017).</p>



<p>AFL has been on the market since 2014 and has been able to detect
over 1000 different types of software errors.  When the development of
the <a href="https://github.com/google/AFL">original AFL repository</a> stalled for
a long time, the community created a fork called
<a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus">AFL++</a> in 2018.
The development of Google hosted project was eventually resumed
by a different team of Google employees (as Michał Zalewski changed
his workplace). Therefore, there are two independent versions of AFL
in active development today.</p>

<p>The design of AFL is primarily based on code coverage through tracing code path execution
(with SanitizerCoverage), then providing feedback to the fuzzer (again with SanitizerCoverage callbacks),
and then using genetic algorithms to craft new inputs
(using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard input</a>) to widen the code coverage.
The <a href="https://github.com/google/AFL#2-the-afl-fuzz-approach">simplified algorithm of AFL</a> is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load user-supplied initial test cases into the queue,</li>
<li>Take the next input file from the queue,</li>
<li>Attempt to trim the test case to the smallest size that doesn’t alter the measured behavior of the program,</li>
<li>Repeatedly mutate the file using a balanced and well-researched variety of traditional fuzzing strategies,</li>
<li>If any of the generated mutations results in a transition to a new state recorded by the instrumentation, add mutated output as a new entry in the queue.</li>
<li>Go to point 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>The readers might ask, why create a new fuzzer?</p>

<p>First of all, AFL was incapable of handling different types of coverage, such as
tracking the evaluation of comparison instructions (in C <code>==</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>!=</code>, etc.).
Next, AFL was unaware of tracking the evaluation of standard (and non-standard)
functions that return certain values depending on the input, such as
the functions for comparing strings (in C <code>strcmp()</code>, <code>strncmp()</code>, etc.).
Finally, AFL was not sufficiently flexible to integrate in environments that
accept input from a different source than the <code>standard input</code>.</p>

<p>The Google employees created a new fuzzer to overcome all the mentioned limitations
and take advantage of the bug detecting features that were already present in LLVM.
The libFuzzer philosophy was to create a tool that operates
similarly to unit testing. We write a small fuzzing program (called the “harness”)
and create programming environment to quickly integrate it into projects
that consists of callable set of functions, typically API of a library.
The fuzzer input is provided as parameters to a regular C function (instead of stdin),
and if possible the fuzzing process is run in persistent mode that
avoids respawning it for every input.</p>

<p>The simplest integration of libFuzzer is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// fuzz_API.cpp
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  DoSomethingWithMyAPI(Data, Size);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two arguments to the <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()</code> function, Data and Size.
This is the buffer of a fixed length that then has to be processed by our
unit testing-like program and passed on to our API.</p>

<p>That said, libFuzzer is tailored towards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuzzing libraries and their APIs, rather than standalone programs.</li>
<li>The behavior should be as deterministic as possible. The same input must result in the same output.</li>
<li>The called library should avoid exiting (by <code>exit()</code> or raising signals) for valid code paths.</li>
<li>It should avoid mutating the global state as otherwise it will confuse the fuzzer.</li>
<li>It should evaluate as quickly as possibly, returning to the fuzzer.</li>
<li>It may use threads, but all newly spawned threads should be joined before returning to libFuzzer.</li>
<li>Collecting diverse sources of coverage as productive as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>AFL is better for one type of projects and libFuzzer for another one.
For example, projects that are not designed as libraries
are hard to integrate with libFuzzer, while entry barrier to AFL testing
can be lower. It is a matter of rebuilding the software and running the fuzzer as-is.</p>

<p>As we presented above libFuzzer operates entirely inside the memory while AFL
feeds the fuzzed program with specially crafted files and passed them to its input.</p>



<p>The fuzzing process begins with the construction of test corpora.
In the case of libFuzzer, this is not necessarily true - it
can generate entirely random input. Of course, this implies practically
no code coverage at the start, and many hours of work before the first
input passing initial integrity checks is produced. Therefore, it is
worth having even a few/odd test cases to start with.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/fuzzing_corpora.svg" alt="Fuzzing corpora"></p>

<p>The goal of minimizing the test files is to get as much code coverage as possible
with as small input file size as possible. The relation is simple:
the smaller the file, the more executions per second can be achieved. It is worth adding that
there is also a process of minimizing a single input file. This operation aims
to remove any redundant data from the test case causing the crash to capture
what exactly happened. According to the libFuzzer documentation, the minimum speed
at which it is worthwhile to start meaningful fuzzing with a prepared body is
1000 iterations per second.</p>

<p>Crash management usually boils down to deduplicating a set of test cases by
comparing the function call stack or a stack trace. Due to limited fuzzer
information during a crash, there are different approaches to solve the
problem here. libFuzzer does not have a module for managing test cases,
and every new fuzzing job is a “clean card” for it. The user must automate
this process by writing the report parser himself/herself.</p>

<p>Readers are encouraged to create and maintain their test corpora - in
the long run, and this is much better than using the “ready-made”
ones found on the Internet or, as mentioned earlier, generating one from scratch.
It is worth categorizing the corpus per application (in case of a single
application) or per file type - if we test many different programs, using
the same file formats.</p>

<p>The more diverse the initial test data, the better. The corpus continuously
evolves during fuzzing: you find inputs that pass through previously unknown
paths in the code. During the operation, smaller files push large files
out of the corpus (if they provide equivalent code coverage). Of course,
you find test cases that cause the program to terminate. The process of
merging the corpus is nothing more than minimizing the sum of the sets:
the corpora that started fuzzing and the newly created test cases.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, to use libFuzzer in your projects, you need to prepare
a lightweight library entry code.</p>

<p>Let’s see at a real world example from the LLVM libFuzzer test-suite, an
example called
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/compiler-rt/test/fuzzer/SingleStrcmpTest.cpp">SingleStrcmpTest.cpp</a></p>

<pre><code>// Part of the LLVM Project, under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions.
// See https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt for license information.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception

// Simple test for a fuzzer. The fuzzer must find a particular string.
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  if (Size &gt;= 7) {
    char Copy[7];
    memcpy(Copy, Data, 6);
    Copy[6] = 0;
    if (!strcmp(Copy, "qwerty")) {
      fprintf(stderr, "BINGO\n");
      exit(1);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we have two conditions for triggering the bug (in our case, calling <code>exit(2)</code> and exiting):</p>

<ul>
<li>Size of the input buffer is larger or equal to 7 bytes.</li>
<li>The first 6 bytes store the sequence <code>"qwerty"</code>, followed by <code>\0</code>.</li>
<li>The rest of the input buffer is ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>We note that there is no <code>main()</code> function in the program, as it is provided directly by the
libFuzzer library. Besides that, the code contains SanCov instrumentation that feedbacks the fuzzer.</p>

<p>This fuzzer uses the <code>strcmp(3)</code> function interceptors that are integrated through Address Sanitizer
into the coverage reporting mechanism in libFuzzer. Thus, there are two ways of executing the program,
with Address Sanitizer enabled and without, and we can see the difference. This also illustrates that
even if the code path is relatively simple, AFL would be totally incapable of guessing code
to break <code>strcmp(3)</code> conditionals in the code and passing random inputs, possibly even never breaking
the program in a finite time.</p>

<p>This happens inside
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/compiler-rt/lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc">sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc</a>:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE_WEAK_INTERCEPTOR_HOOK(__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp, uptr called_pc,
                              const char *s1, const char *s2, int result)

INTERCEPTOR(int, strcmp, const char *s1, const char *s2) {
  void *ctx;
  COMMON_INTERCEPTOR_ENTER(ctx, strcmp, s1, s2);
  unsigned char c1, c2;
  uptr i;
  for (i = 0;; i++) {
    c1 = (unsigned char)s1[i];
    c2 = (unsigned char)s2[i];</code></pre></div></div>

He is the co-author of “<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/exit-to-community">Exit to Community: A Community Primer</a>” and author of“Everything for Everyone: The Radical Tradition That Is Shaping the Next Economy.”</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you remember the time, in the fall of 2016, when rumors swirled that Twitter might be up for sale. As a reporter, I’d come to depend on Twitter. I first started using it heavily during the Arab Spring in 2011, enabling me to follow events on the ground in real-time and connect with activists directly. It felt shocking to me that this tool, which had become so important to my work and my life, was also a commodity. The news reports said maybe Disney or Google would buy it, or maybe Salesforce. This all seemed so arbitrary.</p>



<p>With some nudging from friends, I wrote an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership">article</a> in the Guardian suggesting Twitter should be owned by its users instead. What if that mere feeling that I had of ownership, as a participant in the Twitter-verse, was actually expressed in how the company was owned? I’ve written a lot of articles over the years that propose fantastical ideas; usually, they just plunk in the water. But this time, people around the world actually started organizing. I wasn’t the only person who felt this way. And we had a head start: Many of us had already been working together under the banner of “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40575728/worker-owned-co-ops-are-coming-for-the-digital-gig-economy">platform cooperativism</a>,” trying to graft the lessons of old worker-owned factories and member-owned credit unions into the online economy.</p>



<p>First, we circulated a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/twitter-inc-vote-yes-to-a-co-op-with-your-users">petition campaign</a>, asking Twitter to consider user ownership. Then we realized we had shares of Twitter stock in our community, and we could use those to make a shareholder proposal to the company itself. We had a bit of a legal battle with the company, which tried to strike down our proposal through the American Securities and Exchange Commission. But we won, and the proposal went forward. At the annual meeting in early 2017, we won nearly 5% of the vote — which doesn’t sound like a lot, but it was more than we expected, and it meant we could resubmit later. We also got a lot of attention: articles covered us in <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/lets-build-next-twitter-like-green-bay-packers/">Wired</a>, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/twitter-users-petition-co-op-shareholder-meeting">Vanity Fair</a> and about a <a href="https://www.buytwitter.org/press/">hundred other places</a>. The press thought what we were doing was crazy enough to be interesting. And then life went on.</p>



<p>Or did it? Something weird keeps happening. Those of us working on platform cooperativism have tended to think of ourselves as radicals working against Big Tech. So it came as a surprise to me when, in 2018 and 2019, several of the biggest, baddest tech companies began filing letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking it to allow them to share ownership with their users — to distribute company stock among the very user-workers the platforms refused to classify as employees. </p>



<p>These platforms included the likes of Airbnb and Uber. Like Twitter, these are multi-sided marketplaces that leverage user loyalty to entice fickle investor-owners. Their demand was a modest step, to say the least, yet it looked eerily like a step in the direction of the radicalism we had been calling for — building democracy into the businesses themselves, into how they are owned and governed. The Airbnb letter even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/business/dealbook/airbnb-hosts-shareholders.html">articulated</a> a lot of the rationales that we had been harping on in our little radical world for a few years.</p>



<p>The companies, of course, had their own interests at heart — several seemed to think it might buttress going public on Wall Street — but the letters made me wonder if a deal could be struck. At a time when regulators are starting to clamp down on the big platform companies, what if we could meet the companies in the middle and create a new kind of paradigm, a kind of race to the top? What if companies competed with each other not to extract more data from their users or suppress working conditions, wiping away rights that people have fought for over generations, but instead to offer better deals through shared ownership? </p>



<p>For the same reasons that startups often share stock with early employees, the platforms would get economic alignment with their users and loyalty. Society as a whole would get more built-in accountability for our platforms, a kind of accountability that doesn’t rely on any one jurisdiction or legislature. What if, in turn, we had a new kind of story available to tech startups, a new mythology?</p>

<h5><strong>Another Narrative</strong></h5>



<p>If you’re forming a startup, there are generally two kinds of stories to choose from about what the startup is for. Keep in mind that startups are companies that are trying to take over some subsection of the world. It’s ambitious stuff, so they tend to take on lots of early investment. They get somebody to give them a lot of money so they can hit the market with disproportionate force. And in order to pay that investment back, they need what’s called an “exit,” which usually comes in two forms: You’re either acquired by a larger company or you go public, selling your company on a market where people can trade your shares based on their speculations about what it’s worth. In both cases, you’re passing the company that you’ve worked to build off to new owners, who in turn might be buying it just to convince future buyers to pay even more for it later. It’s a weirdly normal pyramid scheme of capitalism.</p>



<p>What if there were another way? What if a startup that successfully builds a community could opt for an exit to ownership by that community?</p>



<p>This is not so crazy. The more I look, the more I find activists, lawyers, investors and entrepreneurs around the world who are exploring options along these lines, often while seeking to address some of the deep problems of internet culture. Community ownership could be a way of rooting out the abuses that we often see with the billion-dollar “unicorn” startups that make it big and lose their souls to satisfy financial markets, building accountability into the structure of the companies themselves. Too often, tech platforms get caught in the position of trying to extract as much as they possibly can from their users on behalf of their investor-owners, getting away with as much as they think they can.</p>

      “What if a startup that successfully builds a community could opt for an exit to ownership by that community?”    </p>

    
    
  </div>

<p>There’s also a category in the Silicon Valley lexicon called “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drew-houston-dropbox-startup-advice-2018-12">zombies</a>” — the companies that don’t quite become unicorns but aren’t failures either. They’re a dead weight on the investors’ balance sheets because, for one reason or another, nobody wants to buy them. Even if a company like that is making a profit and pleasing users, it can be worthless in the eyes of financial markets if it isn’t poised for the kind of exit options that investors need. What if the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/exit-to-community">exit to community</a> strategy could enable these zombies to be cured of their condition?</p>



<p>I have been working with Morshed Mannan, a legal scholar at the Leiden Law School, to sketch out <a href="https://ntnsndr.in/E2C-strategies">different strategies</a> for this based on what has been done before and what seems at least approximately plausible. Allow me to introduce you to our imaginary company, CoSocial. It’s a social network that managed to sprout a gig marketplace and payment system. It’s more or less a combination of Reddit and TaskRabbit — or, if you’re familiar with the Chinese online ecosystem, just think WeChat.</p>



<p>CoSocial has positioned itself as an upstart alternative to the big platform giants. It has taken a small, energetic slice of the market share, especially among people who want to opt out from the giants. Fees from marketplace payments have even made it at least mildly profitable. But its growth has stalled. Every pathway toward unicorn status seems to point in a direction that would drive away its most loyal users — incentivizing clickbait, adopting dismal labor standards — which puts the whole enterprise at risk. The founders and early investors are at a loss about what to do until they started thinking about their user community itself as the answer, and they come up with three ideas for how to proceed.</p>



<h5><strong>Option 1: Trust Buyout</strong></h5>



<p>The first is for users to buy out the investors. But let’s be reasonable: Even the most loyal users probably wouldn’t have the means or inclination to pony up cash to buy the company. Instead, CoSocial could follow the pattern of the U.S. employee stock ownership plan, in which a trust operating on the employees’ behalf borrows money to buy shares in the company — except in this case, on behalf of users. </p>



<p>At first, commercial banks might be reluctant to participate in the deal, but if a foundation committed a significant portion of mission-related investment funds, for instance, other institutions might join in. Within a few years, CoSocial’s profits would pay off the loan and the users’ trust would become able to keep and distribute the dividends. At first, the company would appoint an initial trustee for the trust, but within five years, the position would be elected by user-members.</p>



<p>This kind of shared pool could take a few forms. For instance, CoSocial’s gig workers might want to supplement their incomes with a proportional cut of the profits on a regular basis. But that benefit might be less important for users primarily interested in the social media features; their contribution to the profits might be much smaller when divided among individuals, but significant when pooled. </p>



<p>In that case, perhaps the dividends derived from their use could become a user-controlled fund for developing features or other initiatives that users choose through a participatory budgeting process. Those funds could also be used to support an independent oversight board — a user-accountable version of the one …</p></div></div>

<h2>The distribution that will not lead you into temptation</h2>

<h3>What is <a href="http://pudge.net/jesux/jesux.html">Jesux</a>?</h3>

<p>
Jesux (pronounced Hay-sooks) is a new Linux distribution for Christian hackers, schools, families, and churches.  There is already a core distribution being prepared, based on RedHat's distribution.
</p>

<p>
Jesux will aim to be an environment that is pleasant for Christians to work in, with all the amenities a Christian might expect, and when possible, free from worldly influences.
</p>

<h3>What is different about Jesux?</h3>

<p>
Below is a short list.  As we get more information, we will put it here.  Send more suggestions to <a href="mailto:jesux@pobox.com">jesux@pobox.com</a>.  Send your suggestions for content in the bookmark, fortune, and .newsrc files, too, and we will start posting some of this stuff.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>default fortune file contains quotes from the scriptures, Augustine, C.S. Lewis, Chuck Swindoll, etc.</li>
    <li>Christian Enlightenment themes featuring Jesus, the cross, and other Christian icons</li>
    <li>Login screen has full text to Lord's Prayer and Pledge of Allegiance, with Christian and American symbols
    <ul>
        <li>Provide alternate screens for non-Americans, perhaps</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pregenerated Netscape bookmarks and .newsrc files pointing to prescreened Christian web sites and newsgroups</li>
    <li>cal(1) includes Christian holidays</li>
    <li>Special hack of emacs "M-x doctor" mode, "M-x pastor"</li>
    <li>Optional technical support and basic counseling services provided by Christian hackers
        <ul>
            <li>The current plan is to double up the tech support line as a crisis line, where people in need can be redirected to people who can really help them</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Online Bible in King James Version
        <ul>
            <li>no other versions will be provided by default; we feel the KJV is the only English version that can be fully trusted</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Addition of <a href="http://pudge.net/jesux/kjv.words.gz">/usr/dict/kjv.words</a> (exhaustive)</li>
    <li>Removal of some of the RedHat games
        <ul>
            <li>we don't play them much, but several of you have noted that some of them are clearly inappropriate</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Squid proxy server (plus squidGuard) bundled and configured for blocking illicit web sites (including a regularly updated list of illicit sites and URL patterns to install on your own; we will be looking for mature and diligent volunteers to help maintain it)</li>
    <li>Optionally disable logins on Sunday, the day of rest</li>
    <li>bash(1) is default
        <ul>
            <li>the "Bourne-Again" shell is already the default; but we like the shell, and we love the name :)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>chmod(1) accepts hexadecimal modes, such as 0x01B6</li>
    <li>qmail replaces sendmail as the standard MTA (sendmail was written by a prominent homosexual)
    <!-- Happy Birthday, Funny Little Man!  sweeeet.  -->
        <ul>
            <li>we are considering postfix too, due to popular request</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hierarchical user structure, so parents and teachers can easily access children's files without needing to become root</li>
    <li>No encryption provided; Christians have nothing to hide
        <ul>
            <li>We have had concerns about the "no encryption" item ... but no worries, crypt(3) will still be there.  Sorry for the confusion, we do not generally consider it as encryption, though, of course, technically it is.  But since it is generally unsuitable for anything other than password authentication, we don't see any problem with it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>No cracking utilities provided; SAINT can be acquired from us later, after the user has proven his worth</li>
</ul>

<p>
All new code will be provided under the <a href="http://pudge.net/jesux/cspl.html">Christian Software Public License</a>, an Open Source-compatible license.  Go ahead and <a href="http://pudge.net/jesux/cspl.html">check it out</a>.  The final CSPL is very similar to the BSD license, where the required advertising is the text of John 3:16 from the King James Version of the Bible.  <em>(Note: the requested requirement that only Christians could redistribute the code was considered and rejected, in accordance with the "No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups" section of the Open Source Definition.  We actually agree with this section of the OSD ... the more people that use our software, the more that see the Gospel; the more that distribute it, the more that advertise His word in His name!)</em>
</p>

<p>
Also, we are seriously considering changing some fundamental OS features.  The idea would be that function calls and features suggesting evil and otherwise pagan ideas would be changed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>abort(3)</li>
    <li>kill(1)</li>
    <li>references to "daemon"</li>        
</ul>

<p>
NOTE: we do <strong>not</strong> believe words are inherently bad.  We simply do not like these words because of their connotations in different contexts.  You do not have to agree, but you will not change our minds.  However, because this is not a point of religious contention but of linguistics and meanings and associations, and because the solution seems like the easiest one to implement, the current plan is to provide symlinks, headers, macros, etc. so that the existing names will still exist, but those who want to use alternate symbols (words) can do so.
</p>

<p>
In the interest of getting out a functional system, these will all wait for some future release anyway.
</p>


<h3>When will it be out?</h3>

<p>
Jesux will be here in late December (hopefully before Jesus arrives :).  Contact <a href="mailto:jesux@pobox.com">jesux@pobox.com</a> for more information.  Ask to be put on our announcement list.
</p>


<h3>Latest News</h3>

<p>
We have been asked several times about "corporate information."  We are not a company, and will not be.  We are volunteers doing this in our free time, and seek not a dime of profit, not a penny of contribution or charity.  We have all been involved in open source projects for a few years, and this one is no different in that respect.  It is different in that it is closer to our hearts and can possibly make a real difference in people's lives.
</p>

<p>
We have been getting lots of requests about whether or not this site is a hoax.  We understand the reasons why, but it saddens us.  What has become of our society that it is so hard to believe that people are earnestly seeking to do good in God's name, to follow Him, and to help others through the power of the Holy Spirit?  Please do keep the mail coming, but don't bother asking us if this is a hoax.  We are here to do what we think is good and right.  We don't have time to answer such frivolous mail anymore.  Please keep all your other messages coming, though!  We still don't have time to answer all of them, but we answer what we can, and we will add you to our announcement list if you request it.  Thank you!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Apologies</strong>:  We rightfully criticized slashdot.org previously, but we did not do so with a loving spirit.  For that, we apologize.  We still will not bow to the media, we do not need the media, and we will succeed in providing a distribution for you.  If God is for us, who can be against us?
</p>

<p>
We are considering making the first distribution of Jesux as a set of patches over the most recent RedHat distribution.  This will make "time-to-market" quicker, and make distribution easier, too.  Many of you have requested that we post what we have, so people can start using it, and participating in the development.  We are planning on it!  Be patient; good things come to those who wait.  :)
</p>

<p>
We are getting great feedback (even from some of you who don't like us, or what we are doing).  Keep it coming!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>How I think I want to drop modern Python packages into a single program</h2>

	<p><small>September 16, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>For reasons beyond the scope of this blog entry, I'm considering
augmenting <a href="https://github.com/siebenmann/exim-attachment-logger">our Python program to log email attachment information
for Exim</a> to
use <a href="https://github.com/decalage2/oletools">oletools</a> to peer
inside MS Office files for indications of bad things. Oletools is
not packaged by Ubuntu as far as I can see, and in any case it would
be an older version, so we would need to add the oletools Python
packages ourselves.</p>

<p>The official oletools install instructions talk about using either
pip or setup.py. As a general rule, we're very strongly against
installing anything system-wide except through Ubuntu's own package
management system, and the environment our Python program runs in
doesn't really have a home directory to use pip's --user option, so
the obvious and simple pip invocations are out. I've used a setup.py
approach to install a large Python package into a specific directory
hierarchy in the past (Django), and it was a big pain, so I'd like
not to do it again.</p>

<p>(Nor do we want to learn about how to build and maintain Python
virtual environments, and then convert how we run this Python program
to use one.)</p>

<p>After some looking at pip's help output I found the '<code>pip install
--target &lt;directory&gt;</code>' option and tested it a bit. This appears to
do more or less what I want, in that it installs oletools and all
of its dependencies into the target directory. The target directory
is also littered with various metadata, so we probably don't want
to make it where the program's normal source code lives. This means
we'll need to arrange to run the program so that <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> is
set to the target directory, but that's a solvable problem.</p>

<p>(This '<code>pip install</code>' invocation does write some additional pip
metadata to your <code>$HOME</code>. Fortunately it actually does respect the
value of the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable, so I can point that at
a junk directory and then delete it afterward. Or I can make <code>$HOME</code>
point to my target directory so everything is in one place.)</p>

<p>All of this is not quite as neat and simple as dropping an <code>oletools</code>
directory tree in the program's directory, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/UpdatingToRarfile30">in the way that I could
deal with needing the rarfile module</a>, but then
again oletools has a bunch of dependencies and pip handles them all
for me. I could manually copy them all into place, but that would
actually create a sufficiently cluttered program directory that I
prefer a separate directory even if it needs a <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> step.</p>

<p>(Some people will say that setting <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> means that I should
go all the way to a virtual environment, but that would be a lot
more to learn and it would be more opaque. But looking into this
a bit did lead to me learning that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python 3 now has standard
support for virtual environments</a>.)</p>

    <p>Scott H Young a writer, programmer, traveler and avid reader of interesting things. For the last ten years he's been experimenting to find out how to learn and think better. Today he swings by the show and talks to us about how we can master hard skills faster!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTES</strong><br>
"What you need is not just motivation, but you need some kind of system. You need some way to channel that initial burst of enthusiasm into creating structures for your life so that you will kind of consistently re-engage with it and consistently do what you need to do to learn things better." [00:07:37] </p>

<p>"The way that mental models become useful is when you really spent a lot of time thinking about them, not when you just heard their name and kind of written them down and understood a few sentences." [00:13:54] </p>

<p>"There is a certain type of person, I guess you could say that like they do need to stop reading, they need to actually start just taking action on things and implementing things." [00:24:23] </p>

<p>"The possibilities of learning are a lot more vast than you've maybe previously considered." [01:02:17]</p>

<p>This article marks ten years of writing about news on Safari for mobile (see the <a href="https://firt.dev/ios-4.2">first article on the series</a>). It's been a bumpy ride, detecting many new APIs and bugs, and asking questions the Safari doesn't want to respond. Of course, you may know about the <a href="https://firt.dev/lazy">bullying I've got from the team lately</a>. But here I am, keeping the story alive :).</p>

<h2 id="what's-new-in-a-nutshell">What's new in a nutshell <a href="#what's-new-in-a-nutshell">#</a></h2>
<p><em>New Safari features for users</em>: Page translation, Privacy Report, Performance Improvements<br>
<em>Default browser</em>: You can change the Default Browser App－Chrome or Edge now available, but there are some UX issues including reset choice on restart, and they are still not full browsers.<br>
<em>New Abilities and APIs</em>: Updated JS engine (BigInt, public class fields), HTTP/3 experiment, TouchID and FaceID for Web Authentication, SMS One Time codes supported.<br>
<em>New for Design &amp; Media</em>: WebP 🥳, HDR video, Picture in Picture for video playing, new Image Picker, some CSS additions<br>
<em>Geolocation</em>: Now Safari can expose the accurate or an approximate location based on the user's decision. Be aware of this!<br>
<em>Service Worker</em>: Safari and a PWA now share the registration and the cache storage, Chrome and Edge now support SWs as well as your web views if you follow some rules<br>
<em>Progressive Web Apps</em>: They don't appear in the new App Library, some bugs were solved, the white theme color is not supported anymore, and some limitations are still there. No better support for Web App Manifest or other PWA-related APIs<br>
<em>iPadOS</em>: Now PWAs can share the screen with other apps (including other PWAs), and with Apple Pencil, web apps can receive handwriting text over editable elements<br>
<em>WebViews and PWAs in AppStore:</em> Still no getUserMedia; a new feature to register safe domains that will give more power to a web view (such as Service Workers).<br>
<em>Security bug:</em> A significant security bug with Web Share is still there</p>
<h2 id="new-features-for-users">New Features for Users <a href="#new-features-for-users">#</a></h2>
<p>Safari users on iOS and iPadOS now have a couple of features that will impact how they browse our websites.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-report">Privacy Report <a href="#privacy-report">#</a></h3>
<p>The new privacy report is available in Safari (not in standalone PWAs). It will let the user know what ITP (Intelligent Tracking Prevention) has done to reduce tracking around the Web. The most visible enemy of this is Google Analytics, as it always appears as the most blocked target.</p>
<h3 id="website-translation">Website Translation <a href="#website-translation">#</a></h3>
<p>Safari now can translate a webpage into different pages (something that Chrome has supported for years). Unfortunately, I didn't find a way for a web owner to disable that feature as Chrome has with a meta tag.</p>
<h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements <a href="#performance-improvements">#</a></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-14-beta-release-notes">Safari Release Notes</a> (published in beta only for some reason), these are the new performance advantages for iOS and iPadOS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported the incremental loading of PDF files.</li>
<li>Improved tab closing performance.</li>
<li>Improved IndexedDB performance.</li>
<li>Improved JavaScript cookie access performance.</li>
<li>Improved for-of performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="default-browser-change">Default Browser Change <a href="#default-browser-change">#</a></h2>
<p>iOS 14 supports the <em>browser entitlement</em>, a right granted by Apple to apps that are web browsers as their primary goal (also known as "not Facebook"). This entitlement must be required from the browser team by email, and it will be granted if your App has web browsing as its primary purpose.</p>
<p>Right now, only the latest versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge in the AppStore have granted access to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Brave from the App Store are not Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Brave. They are just skins with UI behavior on top of WebKit's web view. The amount of things they can add or replace is limited. iOS 14 hasn't changed this situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-change2.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-change2.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="729"><figcaption>At this point, only Chrome and Edge have the browser entitlement to appear in this list</figcaption></figure>
<p>The place to change the default browser is a little odd, however. I was expecting one setting option in General. But instead, we have the setting screen available inside each browser. You will find the same settings within Safari settings, Edge settings, and Chrome settings; that panel will let you change it from a list.</p>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/edge.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/edge.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="2436"><figcaption>Microsoft Edge offers you to set itself as a default browser sending you to Settings</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not even an action such as "Set this App as the default browser"; every browser will contain the full list of available browsers.</p>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-chrome.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-chrome.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="2436"><figcaption>From Settings &gt; Chrome you can access the default browser list</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-safari.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-safari.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="2436"><figcaption>From Settings &gt; Safari you can also access the default browser list</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a bug right now that will reset your choice of default Browser App every time your phone restarts. Also, the option to set the choice again dissapears from Safari when restarted. It needs to be re-defined on Edge or Chrome Settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="hello-service-worker">Hello Service Worker <a href="#hello-service-worker">#</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="#app-bound-domains">App-Bound Domains</a>, browser apps with the browser entitlement will have app-bound domains enabled for the entire Web. That means that Service Workers are now available in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple didn't document anywhere that App-bound domains will grant Service Workers to Web View. Still, the reality is that they are enabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Worker registration and Cache Storage is unique to each browser. So if you browse the same web app in Safari, Chrome, and Edge, you will end up with three copies of the files. This situation is expectable, and the same happens on Android and desktop.</li>
<li>I'm not 100% sure about the storage limits and lifespan yet; my current estimation is that it won't follow the current WebKit 7-day limit but, who knows for sure 😐</li>
<li>Read more about this at the <a href="#service-workers-in-web-views">Service Workers in Web Views</a> section</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-changing-a-default-browser-means-and-what-it-doesn't-mean">What changing a default browser means and what it doesn't mean <a href="#what-changing-a-default-browser-means-and-what-it-doesn't-mean">#</a></h3>
<p>When you change the default browser, all <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> URLs that we use within the <code>openURL</code> native API will now be sent to that default browser instead of Safari. Clicking links on different apps is the most common example of this action.</p>
<p>We need to remember that browsers other than Safari on iOS and iPadOS are not full browsers. I used to call them pseudo browsers. They look like a browser, but it's just WebKit's web view (not even Safari) from a rendering engine perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not completely clear what happens with news URLs that seem to be captured by Apple News when the user has a subscription. <a href="#news%2B-reading-web-links">See more</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main problems that pseudo browsers on iOS and iPad have today are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>They can't use their web rendering and execution engines</em></li>
<li>They can't add icons (WebClips) to the home screen as Safari (therefore, <em>no PWA installation support</em> for alternative browsers)</li>
<li>They can't be used as a replacement of SafariViewController when other apps (such as Twitter) are creating an In-App browser; therefore, you will still use a forced Safari within apps (including session issues)</li>
<li>They are tied to WebKit APIs for the WebView; for example, WebRTC and getUserMedia are still not fully supported there (no raw camera access)</li>
<li>While they could add more API bridging with native, Most big players don't want to play on that field; it's never clear when Apple will approve that, as well as it might open some security risks</li>
<li>Now users can enable WebKit's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) on every WebView-based App, including browsers. The browser itself can't decide about that feature that may be enabled within its boundaries and affect how it renders content.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ux-inconsistencies">UX Inconsistencies <a href="#ux-inconsistencies">#</a></h4>
<p>There is no API for browsers to request being the default browser, or for other apps to query about the current browser. And the latter is leading to some UX inconsistencies. Let's see them.</p>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-svc.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-svc.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="2436"><figcaption>SafariViewController renders a Safari icon (bottom-right) that can now point to other browsers, such as Chrome. UI does not update to reflect that situation.</figcaption></figure>
<p>SafariViewController is the first victim of this issue. When you render a website in SafariViewController, such as when you click on a link within Twitter, the UI has a Safari icon that now may point to other browsers, such as Chrome.</p>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-fb.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-fb.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="1408"><figcaption>Facebook Mobile Browser also shows an 'Open in Safari' menu item that now may open a different browser</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, Facebook Mobile Browser has a menu item to "Open in Safari" that opens Chrome instead, if the latter is defined as default.</p>
<p>As far as I know today, there will be no way now to open a URL in Safari.  Apps that let you choose the browser you prefer to open links should change their behavior. Feedly is one example of this kind of Apps.</p>
<figure><img src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-feedly.png?auto=format" alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://firt.imgix.net/img/notes/ios14/browser-feedly.png?auto=format" width="1125" height="1063"><figcaption>Feedly lets you define your preferred browser; this will be a problem from iOS …</figcaption></figure></section></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Like many people across the world, I’m using my quarantine effectively: by catching up on all the video games I wasn’t able to play while traveling. The game at the top of my list? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)">Spider-Man</a>, which was widely recognized as one of the top games of 2018. The game is features an open-world, which means you can travel around the game map as you see fit. And since Spider-Man, canonically, lives in real-life New York City, this means you’ll spend hours webbing around an incredibly detailed version of the city that never sleeps.</p>

<p>If you’ve spent any appreciable amount of time in New York, the in-game world will immediately feel familiar. The developers nailed the look and feel of the city. I found myself using real-world landmarks to orient myself as I slinged (slunged?) across Manhattan. The game leans into this realism—it even includes a challenge where you can take photos of in-game landmarks. While some are unique to the Marvel universe, like Avengers Tower and Uncle Ben’s grave, many exist in the real world and are faithfully reproduced within the game: Williamsburg/Brooklyn/Manhattan/Queensboro Bridges all make an appearance, as does Grand Central, Madison Square Garden, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, Columbus Circle, the High Line and many more points of reference. As you’re swinging through the city, you’re treated to great views of Manhattan’s skyline, anchored by the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Freedom Tower. Except, it’s <em>not</em> the Freedom Tower, despite being located in the exact same location as its real-life counterpart. Why are equally famous buildings like the Empire State Building accurately depicted, but the Freedom Tower isn’t?</p>

<p>Here’s what the “Freedom Tower” looks like in the game:
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/spiderman-1wtc.png" alt="In-Game 1WTC">
<em>(credit to Polygon because I was too lazy to get this off my PS4 myself)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the in-game design looks to be based on Libeskind’s original design for Freedom Tower (an interesting recap of the changes can be found <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/daniel-libeskinds-world-trade-center-change-of-heart">here</a>), lending further credence to the theory that this building is supposed to be 1WTC.</p>

<p>My curiosity was further piqued when I learned that the <em>real</em> One World Trade Center was actually in the game during a demo at E3 in June of 2018, less than 4 months before the final game was set to be released to the public!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/1wtc_e3.png" alt="Real-life 1WTC in Spider-Man demo from E3 2018"></p>

<p>This deadline is even closer than it appears at first glance as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#RTM">“gold master”</a> is finalized weeks before release date so manufacturers have time to make and distribute the game to retailers. This change must have been implemented at the 11th hour.</p>

<p>And even after swapping the model out, they featured the building prominently on the home screen in the released version of the video game!
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/spiderman-start.png" alt="Start screen">
<em>(<a href="https://www.noobfeed.com/features/1119/marvel-s-spider-man-how-do-you-access-new-game-plus-and-ultimate-difficulty">credit</a>)</em></p>

<p>So <em>why</em> isn’t the real-life 1 WTC featured? At this point, we can eliminate time and budget constraints because we know the model already existed and was implemented before launch. We know that the designers thought this building was important as it’s the first thing you notice when starting the game.</p>

<p>I wish to briefly introduce <strong>Buccini’s razor</strong>—if something fun disappears unexpectedly, the cause is litigation (real or imagined).</p>

<p>It turns out that just like an author can copyright their book and a musician can copyright a song, an architect can copyright a building. Sure enough, here’s the copyright record for One World Trade Center:
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/copyright_record.png" alt="Record from [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/); can't deeplink the record but you can find it yourself by using the document record seen above"></p>

<p>At this point, I had a strong feeling copyright law was the reason for the change. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/9grnr8/freedom_tower/">internet</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/9d3paw/the_real_reason_for_the_redesigned_freedom_tower/">seems</a> <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/191635-marvels-spider-man/76988485">to</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/one-world-trade-center-has-been-removed-from-spider-man-ps4.1465315/">agree</a>.</p>

<p>As luck<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> would have it, there was <a href="https://www.nexsenpruet.com/professionals/jeff-reichard">an expert in architectural copyright</a> right around the corner from my house here in Greensboro! Jeffrey was kind enough to spend a few minutes of his time thinking about this not-at-all-important question.</p>

<p>First, Jeffrey noted that <em>copyrights expire</em>. Just as music and books can pass into the public domain for anyone to replicate freely, you can also build an exact replica of the Empire State Building here in the United States if you so choose. Generally, any building constructed after December 1, 1990 is covered by the <a href="https://www.djc.com/news/ae/11151054.html">Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act</a>. This would explain why older structures are replicated faithfully but the Freedom Tower is not.</p>

<p>However, this doesn’t tell the full story. As Jeffrey noted, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120">17 U.S. Code § 120(a)</a> “provides an exception related to pictorial representations of of buildings that are visible from a public place. Therefore, I am not sure exactly why they changed it in the video game.”</p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle lies at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo5A_fuDgtk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2666">end of the credits</a>, where the creators of the game specifically thank the owners of certain famous buildings in New York, including the Empire State Building. I found this curious as the Empire State Building should be doubly safe: it was constructed long before 1990 so it is not covered under copyright law, and it is visible from a public place so it should be exempt from any potential copyrights. But look closer. You’ll see that they are acknowledging the <em>trademark</em> holders, NOT the <em>copyright</em> holders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.photosecrets.com/buildings-copyright-and-trademarks">As this page</a> helpfully explains, applying a trademark to the building limits how the building’s image can be used in the sale of goods and services (like video games)! The credits hint that the video game creators obtained limited licenses to use the trademark, i.e. the distinctive design and appearance of the building, for certain buildings such as the Flatiron Building.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore, the most likely answer is that the distinctive shape of 1 World Trade Center is either trademarked (although I could not find it within USPTO databases) or is so recognizable that it is easily defensible via a common law trademark and the game developers were unable to secure a license to use the trademark before their deadline.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzuHo80U2M">Sony just announced</a> an expansion to the Spider-Man video game, so perhaps the additional time and the demonstrated popularity of the first installment will help resolve this issue for the upcoming title.</p>

    <p>I saw this great meme today:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/console-wars/meme.png" alt="Meme"></p>

<p>Here we are, about three months out from the biggest shopping period of the year. Both Microsoft and Sony announced their next-generation consoles with splashy livestreams. They announced off new titles, showed off tech demos, and talked up their hardware specs. But both events had one glaring omission: the price.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is game theory in action. There are two main ways to make revenue in the console business: selling the hardware and taking a rake on video game sales via a licensing fee. For the most part, consoles are at feature parity. Many titles are available on both platforms and the graphics are of similar quality. Therefore, prcee is one of a few key differentiators between products, yet pricing the product correctly requires balancing many different factors.</p>

<p>We’ve seen how sensative consumers are to price in the last two generations. Sony tried to position the PlayStation 3 as a hulking machine meant for hard-core gamers who demanded the top performance, launching their the base model at $499.99. Meanwhile, the Xbox base model launched at $299. The cheaper price made the Xbox more appealing for the average family, and the Xbox moved nearly double the number of units in the US when compared to the Playstation 3.</p>

<p>But it was Microsoft who made a pricing mistake in the next genreation. They priced their console at $499, a price that was significantly higher than many expected. This was most likely to cover the cost of the Kinect sensor, which was bundled with the console at launch. Instead, it was Sony that announced that the Playstation 4 would launch ath the $399 price point that many analysts expect Microsoft to anchor at. Microsoft’s fatal mistake was to bet big on Kinect being a hit with casual gamers, even though casual gamers are much less likely to shell out big bucks for video game consoles. The PS4 has more than doubled the sales of the Xbox One.</p>

<p>Selling more consoles is crucial for another reason: per-unit profit. Consoles are overbuilt when first released. The hardware has to last for an entire “generation” which, on average, lasts about 5-7 years. Since the components are so cutting edge, they are expensive to manufacture and acquire. Even pricing consoles at their true cost, and taking no profit whatsoever, would mean setting a price so high that it is beyond the reach of many consumers. Manufacturers have decided it’s better to take a loss on the unit upfront in order to move more units. Why? Because the more units you produce, the cheaper the consoles are to make. Ordering more parts amortizes the huge upfront design expenses over a larger base and gives you greater negotiating power over your suppliers. Your employees get better at making the devices so your defect rate drops. These factors combine to increase your margins, which allows you in turn to cut the price of your console to make it even more attractive, which causes you to sell even more units, and so on.</p>

<p>The second key is that video game developers go where the gamers are. If your platform has a significant portion of the market for video games, you have more pricing power when it comes to the licensing fee you charge developers. And the larger your install base, the more games you will sell in aggregate.</p>

<p>Sony and Microsoft are probably just now ramping up their assembly lines for the holiday shopping boom. They’re probably only now understanding what their defect rate is and how certain design decisions are affecting the cost of the machine. Each knows the price that they would <em>like</em> to sell the console for. The question remains: how high can they go without getting kneecapped by the other? And is their price low enough that they can do the same to their rival? One has to wonder how long this game of chicken can go on for. But one way or another, come Black Friday, a price will be set.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/LearningEdge/simulations/platform-wars/Pages/default.aspx">play around with the pricing simulator</a> built by MIT/Sloan and read the associated case studies to develop a more intuitive feel for the forces at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept <a href="https://kubeedge.io/en/">KubeEdge</a> as an incubation-level hosted project.</p>



<p>KubeEdge is an open source system for extending containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at the edge. It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides infrastructure support for network, application deployment, and metadata synchronization between the cloud and the edge.</p>



<p>“We designed KubeEdge to address three major challenges in edge computing – network reliability between the cloud and edge, resource constraint on edge nodes, and scalability challenges of highly distributed edge architectures,” said Zefeng Wang and Yin Ding, KubeEdge maintainers. “By extending cloud native technologies to the edge, KubeEdge forms a complete edge cloud computing ecosystem. We are very excited to continue to make the project more robust as it moves to incubation.”</p>



<p>KubeEdge was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project in March 2019, and released version 1.0 in June 2019. The KubeEdge team now releases quarterly, timed with the release of upstream Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since joining CNCF, KubeEdge has added more than <a href="https://kubeedge.devstats.cncf.io/d/18/overall-project-statistics-table?orgId=1">395 Contributors</a> from 25 organizations. The project has 14 maintainers from 5 different organizations, including Arm, China Unicom, Huawei, infoblox.com, and inovex.de, and is used in production by <a href="https://huaweicloud.com/">Huawei Cloud</a>, <a href="https://kubesphere.io/">KubeSphere</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md#raisecom-technology-coltd">Raisecom</a>, <a href="https://cucc.wocloud.cn/">WoCloud</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md#xinghai-iot">Xinghai IoT</a>, and more.</p>



<p>“KubeEdge solves a complex and unique use case of running containerized applications on edge devices, which benefits the cloud computing ecosystem as a whole,” said Alena Prokharchyk, CNCF TOC member. “Its architecture meets the reliability, availability, and extensibility criteria needed for further growth and adoption. We look forward to seeing new and improved features as the project moves to this new level.”</p>



<p><strong>Main KubeEdge Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Cloud-Edge Reliable Collaboration: Ensure reliable messages delivery without loss over an unstable cloud-edge network.</li><li>Edge Autonomy: Ensure edge nodes run autonomously, and the applications on edge run normally, even when the cloud-edge network is unstable, or the edge is offline and restarted.</li><li>Edge Device Management: Managing edge devices through Kubernetes native APIs implemented by CRD.</li><li>Lightweight Edge Agent: Extremely lightweight Edge Agent&nbsp; (EdgeCore) to run on the resource-constrained edge.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Notable Milestones:</strong></p>



<ul><li>&gt; 2,500 Commits</li><li>&gt; 2,900 GitHub Stars</li><li>&gt; 780 Forks</li></ul>



<p>KubeEdge is an active participant in the CNCF community and contributes to the upstream Kubernetes project to solve common issues. The project is built on Kubernetes and integrates with other CNCF projects, including containerd and CRI-O as a lightweight container runtime, Prometheus for metrics on the edge, and Envoy for ingress. It also uses gRPC to offer cloud edge remote calls for applications.</p>



<p>The KubeEdge team also <a href="https://thenewstack.io/kubeedge-and-its-role-in-multi-access-edge-computing/">collaborated with LF Edge</a> in setting up the Akraino KubeEdge Edge Service Blueprint Family and Akraino Eliot Blueprint Family projects, which can be deployed at enterprise edges or as a cloud edge extension interfacing to the core telco network.</p>



<p>“Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestrator for cloud native services and is starting to evolve in future edge computing deployments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO/COO of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “KubeEdge plays an important role in bringing Kubernetes to the edge. We look forward to seeing how the project develops and pushes the Kubernetes community into new areas.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a CNCF-hosted project, joining incubating technologies Argo, CloudEvents, CNI, Contour, Cortex, CRI-O, Dragonfly, etcd, Falco, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS, Notary, OPA, OpenTracing, Operator Framework, Rook, SPIFFE, SPIRE, and Thanos, KubeEdge is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">CNCF Graduation Criteria</a>.</p>

		<p><span>Go, sometimes referred to as Golang, is Google’s programming language and was released in 2009 with a huge growing community of developers. Go makes it easier for developers to write solid and efficient code. It’s a statically typed, compiled and open source programming language.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Go has a lightweight architecture and suitability for use in microservice and serverless architecture. Go also helps working on large scale projects that require high-level multiprocessing and networking.</span></p>

<p><span>Due to its usability and simplicity, it’s categorized as one of the first-class citizens of serverless architecture like AWS Lambda and Microsoft Azure and has also found its way up to large organizations like Netflix, Cloudflare, Docker, Adobe and and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>As more people and companies are using open source elements in their Go projects, it’s always advisable to stay updated on known vulnerabilities affecting.</span></p>

<p><span>Go doesn’t provide a lot of features and capabilities on its own, so the community is still figuring out the best packages and frameworks to use.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Everyday, lots of packages pop up on the internet and gain popularity due to their features, however if these packages are not reviewed by the Go security community, they can introduce vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In this article, we are going to explore common Go vulnerabilities and how to fix them.</span></p>


<h2><b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks</b></h2>
<p><span>Cross-site scripting, usually known as XSS, is one of the most common security vulnerability exploits found in modern web applications. This usually happens when user inputs without being validated or encoded are used as outputs to the browser directly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>With this vulnerability, attackers can easily inject malicious code into the browsers of visitors.</span></p>

<p><span>This malicious code is executed via the unsuspecting user’s web browser by maliciously manipulating the contents of JavaScript and HTML scripts. This exploit can be used to embed malicious scripts into a web page.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>These scripts are usually executed when a user opens the web page or whenever a specific action is performed by the user.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A successful Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be used to:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span>Redirect users to phishing sites</span></li>
<li><span>Steal cookies and session information</span></li>
<li><span>Change and manipulate portions of the web page the user is opening.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>This can cause a lot of problems if this attack is successful on Go web server applications, especially on company web servers, and can lead to user data theft.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s look at the example below:</span></p>



<p><span>and </span><span>index.html</span><span> template:</span></p>



<p><span>This example code is vulnerable to xss attack as we are passing the </span><span>name</span><span> data without encoding or escaping it to the browser.&nbsp; If we pass a malicious code like </span><span>&lt;script&gt;alert(“I’m Malicious”)&lt;/script&gt;</span><span>, it would execute the JavaScript code and pops up </span><span>I’m Malicious</span><span> alert.</span></p>



<p><span>In this example, we are using</span><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/"> <span>text/template</span></a><span> to read and render the html template. </span><span>Text/template</span><span> doesn’t encode or escape output to the browser as HTML response.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>To fix this, we should use</span><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/"> <span>html/template</span></a><span> to render our html templates and as well as escape and validate user generated inputs. </span><span>html/template</span><span> generates correctly escaped html content safe from xss attacks on the web browser.</span></p>

<p><span>When building web apps that renders html templates, you should consider using </span><span>html/template</span><span> to render your html final output.</span></p>

<h2><b>SQL Injection Attacks</b></h2>
<p><span>When building Go applications that deal with databases, it’s always good to be conscious of SQL injection attacks. This is not a new type of vulnerability attack, but a very old and common attack where users with malicious intent inject a malicious SQL command into your database which is then executed by the application.</span></p>

<p><span>This would open up a vulnerability in your application that exposes your application database to attackers. This usually happens when user inputs are not properly validated and encoded before passing them to the database.</span></p>

<p><span>The SQL commands tricks the application into executing unintended actions which could end up in data modification or data theft. The SQL interpreter is not able to differentiate between intended and unintended commands and just executes all commands passed to it without checking how they’re being constructed as long as they’re valid.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>With this vulnerability, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to confidential data.</span></p>

<p><span>In Go applications, there are many ways to handle SQL operations. One common way is to simply use </span><span>fmt.Sprintf()</span><span> to create and construct your SQL queries.</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s take a look at the example below:</span></p>



<p><span>This would query users with the matching email.</span></p>

<p><span>While this might look okay initially, it actually has a some potential vulnerabilities and they are not something you can ignore.</span></p>

<p><span>In the above example you are handling user inputs and not doing any form of sanitation or encoding to ensure the inputs are safe and not with malicious code.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance we can enter a malicious SQL command to drop the whole database instead of our email. Let’s take a look at the example below:</span></p>



<p><span>Instead of passing in our email – </span><span>oyetoketoby80@gmail.com</span><span>, we passed in </span><span>‘; DROP TABLE users;’</span><span> which would output the command:</span></p>



<p><span>If this command is being executed, the whole database would be dropped and deleted. Whoops! That’s quite huge as this could shutdown an application with no backups.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>If you look at the command you would notice that another command </span><span>; DROP TABLE users;</span><span> has been added and the command is used for dropping a table. So basically any command could be passed and executed with nothing holding them back.</span></p>

<p><span>To fix this, you should always escape and encode user inputs and consider using SQL libraries that escape and validate all user inputs against SQL queries before running them. Libraries like </span><span>database/sql</span><span> help prevent this kind of vulnerability automatically.</span></p>

<p><span>With the </span><span>database/sql</span><span> package, you will be able to construct SQL statements that are automatically escaped properly.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance:</span></p>



<p><span>The first </span><span>buildSql</span><span>&nbsp; would return users matching the email, while the second would return nothing and won’t drop any database either. Since </span><span>”’; DROP TABLE users;”’</span><span> is seen as a normal string rather than a command.</span></p>

<p><span>Ensure you are using libraries like</span><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/"> <span>database/sql</span></a><span> to construct and run your SQL queries as it helps automatically escape queries properly.</span></p>

<h2><b>OS Command Injections</b></h2>
<p><b>OS Command injection</b><span> which is also referred to as shell </span><b>injection</b><span> is a security vulnerability that lets a malicious user run malicious arbitrary </span><b>operating system</b><span> (</span><b>OS</b><span>) </span><b>commands</b><span> on the web server where the application is hosted and running. This will basically compromise the application and all its data.</span></p>

<p><span>The goal of the attack is to execute malicious commands on the host operating system of the application. This is usually possible when application interfacing with the system shell passes an unsafe user supplied data to the system shell directly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>With this, the attacker can run commands using the same privileges of the vulnerable application making it possible to use any kind of commands.</span></p>

<p><span>If successful, this could lead to the leakage of data, disruption of service, or other undesirable events as the attacker has full access to the server to do anything.</span></p>

<p><span>In Go 1.9.4 version downward, the </span><span>go get</span><span> implementation, when the -insecure command-line option is used,</span><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php"> <span>does not validate</span></a><span> the import path (</span><span>get/vcs.go</span><span> only checks for </span><span>“://”</span><span> anywhere in the string). This as a result, could “allow remote attackers to run arbitrary malicious OS commands through a malicious web server”.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance:</span></p>



<p><span>Where </span><span>https://khasheav.ru/go-vuln</span><span>:</span></p>



<p><span>With this a user can successfully run malicious code on your server. To fix this, you would need to upgrade to the latest version starting from Go 1.10 upward.</span></p>

<h2><b>CSRF Protection Attacks&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) which is also known as one-click attack is simply an attack that lures users into performing actions they do not intend to perform on a web application in which they are currently logged in and authenticated.</span></p>

<p><span>A CSRF attack uses stolen session cookies provided to an authenticated user to send requests to the server which the user didn’t intend to do. The attacker can disguise a button/link as a normal button/link on the webpage. Clicking that could end up performing an action you didn’t intend to do since there’s no way to validate that the request is triggered “cross-site”.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance, a software for money transfer services could be exploited by an attacker to have a button/link to transfer money to their account by tricking the victim into clicking that button which sends the authenticated request.</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s take a look at the form below:</span></p>



<p><span>If you look at the form above, you can see that it’s used to transfer money to an account. An attacker could steal the cookies from the vuln website and when you click on </span><span>Click to send money</span><span>, it would use the cookies to send authenticated requests for you to transfer </span><span>$8100</span><span> to the accounts with </span><span>attacker@email.com</span><span> without your knowledge. Scary right?</span></p>

<p><span>This could be hosted anywhere as a clone of the application and the link sent through a phishing mail to the victim.</span></p>

<p><span>However, this could be prevented, if you have CSRF protection enabled. One way to do this, for each request, there should be a way to generate a one-time unique token from the web-server that must be provided when sending back a request once the page has loaded.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This token is usually referred to as CSRF token and it’s a random string that’s being generated on every request to a webpage and available to use in the html forms and ajax requests. This token can’t be replayed or forged.</span></p>

<p><span>Implementing this from scratch might seem stressful and time consuming, but the good thing we already have a library doing just that.</span><a href="https://github.com/gorilla/csrf"> <span>gorilla/csrf</span></a><span> middleware library is a library for adding CSRF token protection on your website.</span></p>

<p><span>To implement this on your website:</span></p>





<p><span>the template..</span></p>



<p><span>With this, your website is protected against any CSRF attacks. This will add a random string to the page which attackers can’t guess.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>To implement …</span></p></div></div></section></div>

					<h2>What, why &amp; who for ?</h2>
					<p>This document essentially contains an introduction to the relational algebra that is implemented in SIRA_PRISE. Depending on your background, you may already have some or very extensive knowledge about the subject, in which case you probably do not need to read this document.</p>
					<p>If, however, your knowledge of and about the Relational Model of Data was primarily/solely obtained through the usage of SQL-based systems, and terms such as "relvar", "relation" and "tuple" sound completely unfamiliar to you, then carefully studying this document is probably a sine qua non for you to
						understand and effectively use this new system you've got in your hands.</p>
					<p>This introduction is subdivided in several parts :&nbsp;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The first part, "<a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a>", defines the components that lay the foundation for any relational database : type, value, tuple, relation, ... &nbsp;It is rather mathematical in nature and may therefore seem to be a bit alienating ("What the hell do IT&nbsp;professionals need
							mathematics for ?"), but let me assure you that understanding&nbsp;this part really is relevant and really is needed for you to understand part two properly.
						</li>
						<li>Part two, "<a href="#Relational_Algebra">Relational Algebra</a>", offers a detailed definition and discussion of all the operators of the algebra, which is the part of the relational model that every database user employs in every single query he/she writes and/or&nbsp;executes.
						</li>
						<li>Part two introduces the operators of the algebra, making abstraction of a very particular data type called the interval type. SIRA_PRISE offers support for interval types, and the third part, "<a href="#interval_types">The RA and interval types</a>", introduces how the operators of the algebra behave
							when faced with relations that hold interval-typed attributes.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>
						<a id="Terminology"></a>Terminology
					</h2>
					<p>You may have wondered, at some time, why "Relational databases" (and "Relational dbms's") are called how they are. You may have assumed that it must have had something to do with this thing called "Entity-Relationship modeling" that you may already have practiced at some point in your career. Your
						assumption was wrong. In fact, the first mention of the term "relational" in the context of data management even predates the invention of E/R modeling ... So where dóes the term come from ?</p>
					<p>Well, the term comes from something that we have presumably all been taught about in our math classes, somewhere between the age of 10 and 20, that thing being the "relation". The Relational Model of Data (RM for short) is no more or less than a mechanism to represent data in general, and which has that
						same mathematical concept of a relation as its key building brick. Before digging into the details of the algebra, it is first necessary to define a couple of terms that are frequently used when talking about the RM. That is where we will start this introduction of the relational algebra.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Set</i>
							</h3>
							<p>Lots of people collect things. Stamps, coins, rare books, art reproductions or even original art masterpieces, just name it and someone exists who collects it. You probably have spent some time in your life too, trying to build up some collection. If you have, doubtless that there have been some items
								that you have managed to collect more than once. It was problaby fun trading those "duplicates" with fellow collectors for items that you had not yet managed to collect. Well, a "collection" is a very fundamental concept in mathematics, one that is in fact needed to define what a "set" is.</p>
							<p>In mathematics, a "collection" is, loosely speaking, any possible gathering in any possible quantity of any possible things. The gathering of (chair, cloud, oak tree, chair) is a collection. Note that the collection has two chairs.</p>
							<p>Now, if a collection has the particular property that none of the items in the collection appear more than once, then we call this collection a "set". This property turns out to be a very useful and important one, and therefore sets, and set theory, are very important in mathematics. So important in fact
								that relational database technology could and would not even have been invented without them. Important enough also, to be repeated in bold :</p>
							<p>
								<b>A set is a collection that does not contain duplicates.<br> Something that does contain duplicates, is not a set.
								</b>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Type/Value</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>So {A,1,oak tree,patent} is a set. {A,patent,A} is not. Now, in the context of data management problems, which is what we're interested in, sets such as those&nbsp;are of course not very useful. In the context of data management, sets are mostly useful only if the items they contain are in some way
										"alike". In that context, we usually deal with sets that contain only numbers, only dates, or some such. Useful sets in data management are sets such as {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday} and {true, false}. Without attempting a formal and precise definition of the term, we can (and do) say that a
										Type is such a "useful" set. And a Value is one of the items contained in a Type. Which brings us to :</p>
									<p>
										<b>A Type is a set of Values.</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Additional remarks</i>
									</h4>
									<p>In data management, we will often need to speak about, or refer to, such Types. For that reason, it is customary that all the Types we use are assigned a name. The type {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday}, e.g. could be assigned the name 'Weekdays'. The type {true, false}, e.g. could be
										assigned the name 'Boolean'. Such that we can say :</p>
									<p>
										<b>A Type is a named set of Values.</b>
									</p>
									<p>You might wonder at the mutual dependency in the definition here. A type is a set of values, and a value is an item in a type. In the end, that doesn't really define much, does it ? Shouldn't we have some other definition of what a 'Value' is ? Well, for the purpose of this introduction, that isn't
										really necessary. The reason for this is that the RM (and the algebra) can work with just any set of types. The RM does not "fall apart" if the set of integers is not defined as a type, nor does the algebra. (It would be difficult to build a useful database without that type, but that's another issue.) And
										the most important consequence is that this observation is equally valid "the other way round" : the RM does not stop you from defining whatever type you like. The RM gives you no answer to the question when or why something is a value, and when or why not. As far as the RM is concerned, a value is whatever
										you want it to be, and a type is whatever set you define it to be. It only depends on whether you have a useful purpose for the type or not. A set such as {Em, C, G, ...} might look pretty insane and useless to most readers, but a guitar player would certainly have some good uses for a type holding the guitar
										chords as values ...</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Cartesian product</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Looking at our example types Weekday and Boolean, it's not difficult to see how one can "pick a value from the first type, then pick a value from the second one, then arrange those two picked values to form a pair.". One example of such a pair would be (Monday, false). There are 10 such pairs possible,
										and those 10 pairs can be gathered into a set. Such a set turns out to be a very important concept in mathematics too, so important in fact that the concept of such a set is given a name : the "Cartesian Product".</p>
									<p>
										<b>The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all possible pairs formed from the items in those two sets.</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Remarks</i>
									</h4>
									<p>The term "Cartesian product" is not often encountered in the world of RM. The reason for&nbsp;this will become clear in the next few sections. Nevertheless it is worthwhile to reiterate in a more informal manner : A Cartesian product is a set, and the things that we find in that set are "pairs of other
										things", and those "other things" are precisely the things that are part of one of the sets that were used to form the Cartesian product.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Relation (Traditional mathematics version)</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Traditional set theory then goes on to define the concept of a "Relation" :</p>
									<p>A Relation is a subset of a Cartesian product of two sets.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Remarks</i>
									</h4>
								</li>
								<p>Examples of such relations are then : {(Monday, false),(Monday, true)}, {}, {(Tuesday, false),(Thursday, true)}, ...</p>
								<p>Once again it is worthwhile to reiterate in a more informal manner : A Relation is a set, and the things that we find in that set are "pairs of other things", and those "other things" are precisely the things that are part of one of the sets that were used to form the Cartesian product of which the
									Relation happens to be a subset.</p>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Generalized product</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Following this definition, a relation can be (and is indeed) defined as being a set of pairs. For the context of data management problems, this definition isn't so useful, however. Indeed, when recording data about our customers, sales, ..., we usually record a lot more things than just two. So for the
										specific purpose of data management, the concept of a relation had to be "adapted" somewhat ("generalised" is the correct word, actually) to cater for that problem. It is not difficult to see how this can be done : instead of "picking values from two types and arrange those", one can also "pick one value from
										each of any number of types, and arrange those". The set that is formed by …</p></li></ol></li></ol></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 16 January 2015</em></p><p>It’s easy to view yourself as “not a <em>real</em> programmer.”  There are programs out
there that everyone uses, and it’s easy to put their developers on a pedestal.
Although developing large software projects isn’t easy, many times the basic
idea of that software is quite simple.  Implementing it yourself is a fun way to
show that you have what it takes to be a real programmer.  So, this is a
walkthrough on how I wrote my own simplistic Unix shell in C, in the hopes that
it makes other people feel that way too.</p>

<p>The code for the shell described here, dubbed <code>lsh</code>, is available on
<a href="https://github.com/brenns10/lsh">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>University students beware!</strong> Many classes have assignments that ask you to
write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code.  If you’re
a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code
without permission.  And even then, I would <a href="https://brennan.io/2016/03/29/dishonesty/">advise</a> against heavily relying on this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="basic-lifetime-of-a-shell">Basic lifetime of a shell</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a shell from the top down.  A shell does three main things in its
lifetime.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialize</strong>: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
configuration files.  These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret</strong>: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be
interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminate</strong>: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are so general that they could apply to many programs, but we’re
going to use them for the basis for our shell.  Our shell will be so simple that
there won’t be any configuration files, and there won’t be any shutdown command.
So, we’ll just call the looping function and then terminate.  But in terms of
architecture, it’s important to keep in mind that the lifetime of the program is
more than just looping.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Load config files, if any.
</span>
  <span>// Run command loop.
</span>  <span>lsh_loop</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Perform any shutdown/cleanup.
</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I just came up with a function, <code>lsh_loop()</code>, that will
loop, interpreting commands.  We’ll see the implementation of that next.</p>

<h2 id="basic-loop-of-a-shell">Basic loop of a shell</h2>

<p>So we’ve taken care of how the program should start up.  Now, for the basic
program logic: what does the shell do during its loop?  Well, a simple way to
handle commands is with three steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong>: Read the command from standard input.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse</strong>: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute</strong>: Run the parsed command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I’ll translate those ideas into code for <code>lsh_loop()</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>lsh_loop</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>args</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

  <span>do</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"&gt; "</span><span>);</span>
    <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_read_line</span><span>();</span>
    <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_split_line</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_execute</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>

    <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>status</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s walk through the code.  The first few lines are just declarations.  The
do-while loop is more convenient for checking the status variable, because it
executes once before checking its value.  Within the loop, we print a prompt,
call a function to read a line, call a function to split the line into args, and
execute the args.  Finally, we free the line and arguments that we created
earlier.  Note that we’re using a status variable returned by <code>lsh_execute()</code> to
determine when to exit.</p>

<h2 id="reading-a-line">Reading a line</h2>

<p>Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle.  The
sad thing is that you don’t know ahead of time how much text a user will enter
into their shell.  You can’t simply allocate a block and hope they don’t exceed
it.  Instead, you need to start with a block, and if they do exceed it,
reallocate with more space.  This is a common strategy in C, and we’ll use it to
implement <code>lsh_read_line()</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define LSH_RL_BUFSIZE 1024

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first part is a lot of declarations.  If you hadn’t noticed, I prefer to
keep the old C style of declaring variables before the rest of the code.  The
meat of the function is within the (apparently infinite) <code>while (1)</code> loop.  In
the loop, we read a character (and store it as an <code>int</code>, not a <code>char</code>, that’s
important!  EOF is an integer, not a character, and if you want to check for it,
you need to use an <code>int</code>.  This is a common beginner C mistake.).  If it’s the
newline, or EOF, we null terminate our current string and return it.  Otherwise,
we add the character to our existing string.</p>

<p>Next, we see whether the next character will go outside of our current buffer
size.  If so, we reallocate our buffer (checking for allocation errors) before
continuing.  And that’s really it.</p>

<p>Those who are intimately familiar with newer versions of the C library may note
that there is a <code>getline()</code> function in <code>stdio.h</code> that does most of the work we
just implemented.  To be completely honest, I didn’t know it existed until after
I wrote this code.  This function was a GNU extension to the C library until
2008, when it was added to the specification, so most modern Unixes should have
it now.  I’m leaving my existing code the way it is, and I encourage people to
learn it this way first before using <code>getline</code>.  You’d be robbing yourself of a
learning opportunity if you didn’t!  Anyhow, with <code>getline</code>, the function
becomes easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>lsh_read_line</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ssize_t</span> <span>bufsize</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// have getline allocate a buffer for us
</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getline</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bufsize</span><span>,</span> <span>stdin</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>feof</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span>  <span>// We recieved an EOF
</span>    <span>}</span> <span>else</span>  <span>{</span>
      <span>perror</span><span>(</span><span>"readline"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_FAILURE</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>line</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not 100% trivial because we still need to check for EOF or errors while
reading. EOF (end of file) means that either we were reading commands from a
text file which we’ve reached the end of, or the user typed Ctrl-D, which
signals end-of-file. Either way, it means we should exit successfully, and if
any other error occurs, we should fail after printing the error.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-line">Parsing the line</h2>

<p>OK, so if we look back at the loop, we see that we now have implemented
<code>lsh_read_line()</code>, and we have the line of input.  Now, we need to parse that
line into a list of arguments.  I’m going to make a glaring simplification here,
and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line
arguments.  Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from
each other.  So the command <code>echo "this message"</code> would not call echo with a
single argument <code>this message</code>, but rather it would call echo with two
arguments: <code>"this</code> and <code>message"</code>.</p>

<p>With those simplifications, all we need to do is “tokenize” the string using
whitespace as delimiters.  That means we can break out the classic library
function <code>strtok</code> to do some of the dirty work for us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE 64

  <span>return</span> <span>tokens</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this code looks suspiciously similar to <code>lsh_read_line()</code>, it’s because it
is!  We are using the same strategy of having a buffer and dynamically expanding
it.  But this time, we’re doing it with a null-terminated array of pointers
instead of a null-terminated array of characters.</p>

<p>At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling <code>strtok</code>.  It
returns a pointer to the first token.  What <code>strtok()</code> actually does is return
pointers to within the string you give it, and place <code>\0</code> bytes at the end of
each token.  We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character
pointers.</p>

<p>Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary.  The process repeats
until no token is returned by <code>strtok</code>, at which point we null-terminate the
list of tokens.</p>

<p>So, once all is said and done, we have an array of tokens, ready to execute.
Which begs the question, how do we do that?</p>



<p>Now, we’re really at the heart of what a shell does.  Starting processes is the
main function of shells.  So writing a shell means that you need to know exactly
what’s going on with processes and how they start.  That’s why I’m going to take
us on a short diversion to discuss processes in Unix.</p>

<p>There are only two ways of starting processes on Unix.  The first one (which
almost doesn’t count) is by being Init.  You see, when a Unix computer boots,
its kernel is loaded.  Once it is loaded and initialized, the kernel starts only
one process, which is called Init.  This process runs for the entire length of
time that the computer is on, and it manages loading up the rest of the
processes that you need for your computer to be useful.</p>

<p>Since most programs aren’t Init, that leaves only one practical way for
processes to get started: the <code>fork()</code> system call.  When …</p></div></div>

    <p>The rise of tooling for vulnerability detection combined with pressure driven by Vendor Due Diligence is causing a massive enterprise freezeout for non-mainstream technologies across the board. Of particular concern is the impact this will have on the adoption of functional programming in enterprise and small business B2B development.</p>

<p>I see now that the last 10 years were “easy mode” for the growth of new programming tools and infrastructure, with many new breakthrough technologies seeing rapid adoption. Languages like Node, Go and to some degree Scala saw breakaway success, not to mention all of the new cloud tech, NoSQL tech, containerization and data processing platforms along with their custom query DSLs. Other languages like Haskell saw success in small companies and skunkworks style teams solving very difficult problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-rise-of-vulnerability-scanning">The Rise of Vulnerability Scanning</h3>

<p>Just this past year I’ve come to see we’re in the middle of a massive change across the industry. There are new forces at play which will calcify current software stacks and make it extremely hard for existing or new entrants to see similar success without a massive coordinated push backed by big enterprise companies. This force is the rise of InfoSec and vulnerability detection tooling.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools">Blackduck, WhiteSource, Checkmarx, Veracode</a> are exploding in popularity, there are too many to list and many variations on the same theme. In the wake of so many data leaks and hacking events enterprises no longer trust their developers and SREs to take care of security, and so protocols are being implemented top down. This isn’t just on the code scanning side, there is a similar set of things going on with network scanning as well which impacts programming languages less, but similarly will calcify server stacks.</p>

<p>These tools are quickly making their way into SOC2 and SDLC policies across industry, and if your language or new infrastructure tool isn’t supported by them there’s little chance you will get the previously already tenuous approval to use them. This sets the already high bar for adoption much higher. As you might expect, vendors will only implement support for languages that meet some threshold for profitability of their tools. Not only do you need to build a modern set of tools for your language to compete, now you also need support from external vendors.</p>

<h3 id="vendor-due-diligence">Vendor Due Diligence</h3>

<p>Maybe we just cede this territory to enterprise tools with big backers like Microsoft and Oracle, we never more than a few small inroads anyway. The use of these tools is arguably a good thing overall for software security. Unfortunately, the problem cannot be sidestepped so easily, and I’m afraid this is where things look very bleak. The biggest new trend is in enforcement of these tools through Vendor Due Diligence.</p>

<p>You may not be familiar with Vendor Due Diligence if you aren’t in a manager role. The basic idea is your customer will send you a long list of technical questions about your product which you must fill out to their satisfaction before they buy your product or service. In the B2B space where I work these lists are nothing new, but have been getting longer and longer over the last 10 years, now often numbering in the hundreds of questions.</p>

<p>Most recently I’ve seen more and more invasive questions being asked, some even going into how teams are organized, but important to this article is that across the board they now all ask about vulnerability scanning and now often request specific outputs for well-known vulnerability scanning tools. The implication being that if you’re not scanning with these tools they won’t buy your software, and the list of supported languages is small.</p>

<p>Any experienced technology manager sees the natural tradeoff here. When it comes down to making money versus using cool tech, cool tech will lose every time. You’re just burning money if you’re building cool things with cool tech if you know no one will buy it.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-now">So What Now?</h3>

<p>Potentially we will see a resurgence of “compile-to” functional programming with mainstream language targets to sidestep the issue. I suppose though that the extra build complexity and problems debugging will prevent this from ever being mainstream, not to mention that the vulnerability tools look for specific patterns and likely won’t behave well on generated code.</p>

<p>There is some hope in the form of projects like SonarCube which enables users to come together and <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-plugin-example">build custom plugins</a>. Will functional programming communities come together to build and maintain such boring tech? I somewhat doubt it. This kind of work is not what most programmers would choose to do in their off time. Similarly, vulnerability detection is unlikely to be a good target to be advanced a little at a time with academic papers. It would take true functional programming fanatics to build companies or tools dedicated to the cause. If you are interested in helping out, pay attention to the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> as this list drives focus for many infosec teams.</p>

<p>Where does this leave us? If our communities do nothing then smaller B2B software operations focused mom and pop shops or consumer focused web applications likely won’t see any impact unless static analysis makes it into data protection law. Beyond these use cases FP will be relegated to tiny boxes on the back end where vulnerabilities are much less of a concern and the mathematical skills of functional programmers can bring extreme amounts of value.</p>

<p>I know there are many deeper facets I didn’t cover here, if you want to continue the discussion <a href="https://twitter.com/rickasaurus/status/1300487826782420995">join the thread on twitter</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Why I write recursive descent parsers (despite their issues)</h2>

	<p><small>September 16, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today I read Laurence Tratt's <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/which_parsing_approach.html">Which Parsing Approach?</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/9pcqys/which_parsing_approach">via</a>), which has a
decent overview of how parsing computer languages (including little
domain specific languages) is not quite the well solved problem
we'd like it to be. As part of the article, Tratt discusses how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parsers</a> have a
number of issues in practice and recommends using other things,
such as a LR parser generator.</p>

<p>I have a long standing interest in parsing, I'm reasonably well
aware of the annoyances of recursive descent parsers (although some
of the issues Tratt raised hadn't occurred to me before now), and
I've been exposed to parser generators like Yacc. Despite that, my
normal approach to parsing any new little language for real is to
write a recursive descent parser in whatever language I'm using,
and Tratt's article is not going to change that. My choice here is
for entirely pragmatic reasons, because to me recursive descent
parsers generally have two significant advantages over all other
real parsers.</p>

<p>The first advantage is that almost always, a recursive descent parser
is the only or at least easiest form of parser you can readily create
using only the language's standard library and tooling. In particular,
parsing LR, LALR, and similar formal grammars generally requires you to
find, select, and install a parser generator tool (or more rarely, an
additional package). Very few languages ship their standard environment
with a parser generator (or a lexer, which is often required in some
form by the parser).</p>

<p>(The closest I know of is C on Unix, where you will almost always
find some version of lex and yacc. Not entirely coincidentally,
I've used lex and yacc to write a parser in C, although a long time
ago.)</p>

<p>By contrast, a recursive descent parser is just code in the language.
You can obviously write that in any language, and you can build a
little lexer to go along with it that's custom fitted to your
particular recursive descent parser and your language's needs.  This
also leads to the second significant advantage, which is that if
you write a recursive descent parser, you don't need to learn a new
language, the language of the parser generator, and also learn how
to hook that new language to the language of your program, and then
debug the result. Your entire recursive descent parser (and your
entire lexer) are written in one language, the language you're
already working in.</p>

<p>If I was routinely working in a language that had a well respected
de facto standard parser generator and lexer, and regularly building
parsers for little languages for my programs, it would probably be
worth mastering these tools. The time and effort required to do so
would be more than paid back in the end, and I would probably have
a higher quality grammar too (Tratt points out how recursive descent
parsers hide ambiguity, for example). But in practice I bounce back
and forth between two languages right now (Go and Python, neither
of which have such a standard parser ecology), and I don't need to
write even a half-baked parser all that often. So writing another
recursive descent parser using my standard process for this has
been the easiest way to do it every time I needed one.</p>

<p>(I've developed a standard process for writing recursive descent
parsers that makes the whole thing pretty mechanical, but that's a
discussion for another entry or really a series of them.)</p>

<p>PS: I can't comment about how easy it is to generate good error
messages in modern parser generators, because I haven't used any
of them. My experience with my own recursive descent parsers is
that it's generally straightforward to get decent error messages
for the style of languages that I create, and usually simple to
tweak the result to give clearer errors in some specific situations

<p>I value transparency a lot, especially when it comes to the bug bounty space. Bug bounty hunters all around the world are submitting a range of reports where the issues found span across multiple domains, often leveraging numerous techniques and methodologies. However, if you’re not already an active bug bounty hunter who has a good understanding of what a bounty program expects, or will pay out for, you have a major disadvantage compared to someone who does have this knowledge. I hope through this blog post, I can demystify the sort of issues bug bounty programs pay for.</p>

<p>The last blog post I did in this series was around four years ago, <a href="https://shubs.io/high-frequency-security-bug-hunting-120-days-120-bugs/">120 days, 120 bugs</a>. In the last four years, a lot has happened. I moved to Europe for six months, I moved interstate in Australia twice, I won a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VojwIY4GL-4">live hacking event</a>, I co-founded a company and helped build an <a href="https://assetnote.io/">attack surface management platform</a> with a team of people I consider family.</p>

<p>Unlike my previous blog post, I did not set myself a goal to find a bug a day. Instead, I participated in bug bounties whenever time allowed. There were many months where I found nothing at all, which often terrified me when it came to evaluating my self worth as a hacker. I also admitted to myself, that I might be a good hacker, but there is always going to be a better hacker out there, and I’ve made my peace with that as a hyper-competitve person.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an excellent understanding of fundamental application security <a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246978/Threat%20Classification">attacks and weaknesses</a> before you approach bug bounties, in my opinion, you are wasting your time. <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security">Practice and learn more here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a paid, more extensive resource, check out and practice with <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/">PentesterLab</a>.</p>

<p>Participating so heavily in bug bounties has given us the knowledge at Assetnote about what security teams <em>actually</em> care about. It’s the reason we can maintain high signal when we are continuously finding exposures.</p>

<p>My primary motivation for this blog post is to educate the masses on what bug bounty programs are paying out for.</p>

<p>For example, would you know that you could submit a dangling EC2 IP (subdomain pointing to an EC2 IP that is no longer owned by the company) as a bug report without reading the proof in the pudding below? I’ve been paid for this by programs, so clearly they value this sort of information.</p>
