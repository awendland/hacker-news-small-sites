<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

					<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We’re sharing a raft of new performance results for our MK2 IPU-based machine intelligence systems today. You’ll see our IPU-M2000 system significantly outperforms the Nvidia A100 DGX across the board, with orders of magnitude performance improvements for some models.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Graphcore customers are already making big leaps forward with our second generation IPU systems – whether they prioritise faster time to result, model accuracy, better efficiency, lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) or the chance to make new breakthroughs in AI with the IPU.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen a range of the most popular models our customers frequently turn to as proxies for their proprietary production AI workloads in natural language processing, computer vision and more, both in training and inference.</p>
<p>We are also delighted to share results in this blog using our new PyTorch framework support. We are continuing to develop and expand this capability – you can find out more in our blog <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu"><span>here</span></a>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The results are measured on IPU-M2000 &amp; IPU-POD<sub>64</sub> platforms. Wherever possible, we compare IPU performance against performance numbers published by NVIDIA for the A100 GPU as part of the DGX A100 platform. It’s notoriously hard to find an exact apples-to-apples comparison for very different products and chip architectures, so we compare against the closest platform in terms of price and power. Where NVIDIA has not published results for a particular model, measured results are used.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Code for all of our benchmarks is available from the examples repo on the <a href="https://github.com/graphcore"><span>Graphcore GitHub</span></a> site where you can also find code for many other model types and application examples.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We’ve included notes for each chart to explain our methodology and to provide additional information about batch sizes, data sets, floating point arithmetic, frameworks etc. In addition to publishing our benchmarking charts in this blog and on our <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/benchmarks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, we are also publishing performance data in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tabular format </a>for IPU-M2000 and IPU-POD systems on our website. We’ll add more and update the results regularly.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also joined <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MLCommons</a>, the governing body for the independent benchmarking organisation, MLPerf. We will be participating in MLPerf in 2021 – starting with the first training submission in the Spring – as well as continuing to build out our own performance results.</p>
<p><strong><span>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>BERT-Large Training</strong></p>

<p><strong>BERT-Large Inference</strong></p>
<p>The goal in inference production systems is typically to achieve the highest possible throughput at the lowest possible latency. For example, search engine companies and many automated services using inference need to respond in near real time.</p>
<p>For BERT-Large Inference, the IPU-M2000 delivers 3.4x higher throughput at the lowest latency compared to the A100.</p>

<p>Probabilistic models are used in applications where the underlying system is inherently stochastic. They are widely used in the financial sector and as well as in scientific research. However, many varieties of probabilistic models do not fit well with the SIMD/SIMT architecture of GPUs and run far too slowly to be of use. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

The use of LSTM-based methods in the finance industry is highlighted in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06848.pdf"><span>arxiv paper</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>LSTM Inference</strong></p>
<p>The chart below compares throughput vs latency across a range of batch sizes for the IPU-M2000 vs the latest GPU for an LSTM 2-Layer Inference model. Across a range of batch sizes the performance advantage is apparent. At the lowest latency achievable by the GPU, the IPU-M2000 is capable of achieving 600x higher throughput at a lower latency.</p>

<p><strong>Future Breakthroughs with the IPU</strong></p>
<p>As we have seen, the IPU delivers state of the art performance on established image processing and language models such as ResNet and BERT.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is also clear that the IPU can deliver huge performance gains in several new or currently under-utilised model types which are indicative of the future trend in machine intelligence, like EfficientNet, ResNeXt and MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) probability-based methods.</p>
<p>We are also working on some exciting developments with sparse models, and are introducing a preview version of our generalized sparse library support in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poplar SDK 1.4</a>, which was released today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine intelligence innovation is still in the early stages and we expect to see many new innovations developed over the next few years. The IPU has been designed to help innovators create these new breakthroughs.</p>

And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. <strong>The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.</strong> Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.</strong> We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>He couldn't believe it. This certainly couldn't be true. Someone else must have made a mistake here. He read the email a second time. Maybe he missed something and the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding? But he didn't, of course. He is the kind of person who always pays attention to typos, therefore reading it again was quite pointless. Anger started spreading through him. How dare they? It felt so incredibly stupid and unfair. Especially considering he was such a law-abiding citizen. He despised those who didn't follow rules. They couldn't possibly mean that he was one of them? Yet this is exactly what the email was saying: "We can inform you that you unfortunately have used the wrong licence plate in the app, which is why you have been given a fine. In this case the fine is issued on <strong>AB12345</strong>, while parking was activated for <strong>AB1234</strong> in the app.". Filled with rage, he locked his phone and shoved it back into his pocket. He missed one bloody number!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Validation to the Rescue</h2>
<p>In Norway, license plates for cars follow a certain pattern: they consist of two letters and five digits (there are some exceptions, such as personal license plates). Considering this, we realize that the above scenario could have been avoided merely by adding some form validation! For this, we will utilize <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>, which has become quite popular over the last year. React Hook Form is easy to use, quite lightweight and very performant. It has built-in validation, but also supports schema-based form validation with other tools such as <a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup">Yup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/superstruct">Superstruct</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sideway/joi">Joi</a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume we have this very basic skeleton for a parking app:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> e<span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>onFormSubmit<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The app contains a form with a text input and a button. We also added an <code>onSubmit</code> method that prevents the form from being submitted and the page from being refreshed. Apart from that, the app doesn't really do anything meaningful. Let's add some validation:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> handleSubmit<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onFormSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> ref<span>=</span><span>{</span>register<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we don't need to add much code to set up React Hook Form. We have to call the <code>useForm</code> hook which returns a bunch of methods. For the time being, we simply use <code>handleSubmit</code> and <code>register</code>. We then wrap the <code>onFormSubmit</code> method into the <code>handleSubmit</code> method. This will take care of only invoking <code>onFormSubmit</code> and pass the form data when all fields are valid (it also prevents the form from submitting, so we don't need to explicitly call the <code>preventDefault</code> method). Finally, we need to set the <code>register</code> method as the input field's ref attribute. But this is not the end of the story! The form allows any input, even if it is left empty. This is why we have to specify some validation rules:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>input 
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> 
  placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> 
  ref<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    required<span>:</span> <span>"You must enter a license number."</span><span>,</span>
    pattern<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      value<span>:</span> <span>/^[a-z]{2}\d{5}$/i</span><span>,</span>
      message<span>:</span> <span>"The license number must be a combination of two letters and five digits."</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When registering the input field, we can add several options to adjust how the field should be validated. In the above example, we tell our form that the field is required and that the value must match a specific regex pattern. We also define some error messages. If we try to submit the form, but validation fails, the error message is returned by <code>useForm</code> as an object called <code>errors</code>. Every form field gets its own error message corresponding to the field's <code>name</code> attribute:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>{</span>errors<span>.</span>licenseNo <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errors<span>.</span>licenseNo<span>.</span>message<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can use a simple component, <code>ErrorMessage</code> (we must first install a separate NPM package):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>ErrorMessage
  errors<span>=</span><span>{</span>errors<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all we need to avoid registering an invalid license number! However, there are some more concepts we should have a look at.</p>
<h2>Controlled vs. Uncontrolled</h2>
<p>React Hook Form is designed to work best with <em>uncontrolled components</em>. This means that form data is handled by the DOM itself and can be accessed directly using refs (which is why we put the <code>register</code> method there). <em>Controlled components</em> on the other hand, use event handlers such as <code>onChange</code> to update values at state change. Many third-party libraries use controlled components, and luckily there is a way we can use those together with React Hook Form:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  <span>as</span><span>=</span><span>{</span>ReactSelect<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span><span>}</span>
  isClearable
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We add a <a href="https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select">React Select</a> for choosing the cars fuel type by wrapping it inside a <code>Controller</code> component using the <code>as</code> prop. The Controller automatically injects the <code>onChange</code>, <code>onBlur</code> and <code>value</code> props into the wrapped component. The same applies to other props that may be required by the underlying component (in this case the props <code>options</code> and <code>isClearable</code>). Validation rules are applied by setting the <code>rules</code> prop. Although this is the preferred syntax, you sometimes need to use the <code>render</code> prop instead of the <code>as</code> prop, which lets you customize events, value and ref:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  render<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onChange<span>,</span> onBlur<span>,</span> value<span>,</span> ref <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>ReactSelect
      options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span><span>}</span>
      onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span>
      onBlur<span>=</span><span>{</span>onBlur<span>}</span>
      inputValue<span>=</span><span>{</span>value<span>?.</span>key<span>}</span>
      inputRef<span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span>
    <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Form Context</h2>
<p>When moving input fields to shared components in order to make them reusable, you can of course pass all neccessary methods from <code>useForm</code> as props. In many cases, it would be a more elegant solution to put the whole form into a <code>FormProvider</code> and access the context of the form with <code>useformContext</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> methods <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>FormProvider <span>{</span><span>...</span>methods<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>methods<span>.</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>LicenseNoInput <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>FormProvider<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>LicenseNoInput</code> component can then access the form methods as simple as this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> errors<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useFormContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's pack it all up, add a little more logic and styling and voilà – we have a parking app with form validation that actually works!</p>

<h2>Like a Swiss Army Knife</h2>
<p>There is so much more you can do with React Hook Form! It's too bad I can't cover it all in a single article. I can recommend a look at the <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/api/">official documentation</a>, which also provides many useful examples. Personally, I have been using this tool for about a year now and have never been in a situation where it couldn't solve a problem. If you are still not convinced, the fact that TypeScript is fully supported will hopefully change your mind.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For some reason, I've found that in my career a lot of the work I do ends up involving slow REPL loops: I make a change, run a command, wait for it to finish, and repeat. While I'm sitting there waiting, it's easy to be distracted by things, and I want my task to bring itself back to my attention when it's ready. This desire has led me on a multi-year quest to tailor my notifications perfectly, and in this post I'm going to share what I've come up with.</p>
<p>Here are the features I want my notifications to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should be able to activate them from anywhere in the terminal: in bash, from the ruby console, over SSH, or anywhere else I find myself (in the terminal).</li>
<li>They should be subtle so they don't get too annoying, but noticeable enough that I don't miss them.</li>
<li>The should only fire when I want them: too many notifications will cause me to ignore all of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The early days</h2>
<p>Back in 2015 or so, my company was writing scrapers to extract detailed, structured information from hundreds of websites. Each website was different and since we needed the information to be structured, we had to write a different scraper for each one. A single site could be scraped in about 5 minutes, and the data only changed a few times each year. Still, the sites would change often enough that I frequently found myself sitting in the office until late at night, mostly waiting for these scrapers to break so I could make one small fix, and repeat. Five minutes for each change really adds up when you have to repeat the entire scraper to test a single-line change.</p>
<p>Fortunately, writing scrapers is pretty easy technically, so I didn't need to be 100% focused as I was working on them. That meant that while I was waiting on the latest change I'd made to a scraper, I was able to focus on other high-value activities like shooting for a high score in Peggle Nights.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1309-peggle-small.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Peggle Nights"></p>
<p>But sometimes, when I was planning a tough shot on a high-scoring round, I could forget that I was still at the office waiting for my scraper to crash so I could fix it. That's why I wanted a simple way to get notified when it was waiting for me. My first-ever attempt at building a notifications system used a feature built-in to Mac OS: the <code>say</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>long_running_command<span>;</span> say <span>"done"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This command uses the system's text-to-speech to play through your computer speakers. The scrapers I was writing were mostly in Ruby, so if I were in IRB I could still get the notification:</p>
<pre><code>my_scraper<span>.</span>run_main <span>rescue</span> ex <span>=</span> $<span>!</span><span>;</span> `say done`
</code></pre>
<p>This will play the notification even if the scraper fails, and preserve the raised exception in the <code>ex</code> variable. Neat!</p>
<p>I used this solution for a few months, but I always felt that the text-to-speech was a little unpleasant. I decided to switch out the <code>say</code> command for the built-in audio file player, <code>afplay</code>, and I used one of the default sounds that comes with Mac OS.</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
  afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
<span>}</span>
long_running_command<span>;</span> ding
</code></pre>
<p>That makes this sound, which is a little more subtle than a robotic voice shouting at me.</p>

<p>These two tricks got me along just fine for years. I felt like I had solved the problem and didn't need to think about it any more. Well, except when I started a command that I thought would be fast but it instead took an hour to run. But I developed a trick for that: if you press <code>^Z</code> (Ctrl-Z) to pause the job, then you can use <code>fg; ding</code> to resume it  and ding when it finishes. There. Now it's perfect.</p>
<h2>Improving on perfection</h2>
<p>One day I learned about <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2 shell integration</a>. This provides a bunch of neat features, and one of them is about notifications! It's not very well documented, but if you use Edit ► Marks and Annotations ► Alerts ► Alert on Next Mark, or the much-easier-to-remember Option-Command-A, you'll get a native notification when the currently running command finishes. I installed the shell integration and to this day I use this feature more than anything else that it provides.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020 and I've changed roles again. This time, I find myself automating cloud server provisioners, and waiting for the machines to come up isn't fast. Sadly, the iTerm shell integration has to be installed on each server, and my perfect notification scripts don't work over SSH. Realizing that perfection is a journey and not a destination, I set out to improve my notifications once again. Except this time, I was going to go industrial-strength.</p>
<p>When I was learning about the iTerm2 shell integration, I also found out about <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/11/25/iterm-plugins/">a bunch of other features that iTerm2 supports</a>. If you want to follow along with me, read over that post and install <code>PlaySound.py</code>, <code>iterm_notify</code>, <code>iterm_badge</code>, and <code>iterm_bounce</code> on your computer. These new features had already made my notifications more powerful and SSH-compatible, but I had set my sights beyond a simple "ding!" sound. I wanted a smart notification system that would "ding" when the command completed, but "bonk" when it failed. But first I needed to find the right sounds to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1344-oot-navi.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"></p>
<p>The first sound that came to mind was the iconic "Hey! Listen!" from Ocarina of Time. If you played this game, then you probably know exactly how that sounds. I found a gallery of <a href="http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounds from the Zelda games</a> and searched for some appropriate ones. Eventually I settled on these two, for my "good" and "bad" sounds:</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>The first thing to do is wrap them up in scripts to make them easy to use. I put them in my sound library (which is listing in <a href="https://github.com/CGamesPlay/dotfiles/blob/bee7d071a7b85f7becc696edc0b328677eb16c40/macos/Library/Application%20Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch/PlaySound.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlaySound.py</a>) and wrote these:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound OOT_PressStart
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>bonk</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound MM_Tatl_Alarm.wav
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can run my provisioning script like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
</code></pre>
<p>If the script succeeds, the <code>&amp;&amp; ding</code> will run, resulting in a pleasant chime. Otherwise the <code>|| bonk</code> sound will run and I'll hear a nervous fairy. But I can do better! This is too much to type, and I want to leverage all of my notification channels, not just sound. So I wrote this function:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>sound_status</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>last_status</span><span>=</span><span>$?</span>
    <span>test</span> <span>$last_status</span> -eq <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
    iterm_bounce
    <span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"Command finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>else</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"<span>$@</span> finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>fi</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>$last_status</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This function has 3 important qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>It automatically chooses the sound to play.</li>
<li>It also shows a system notification, with an optional custom message.</li>
<li>It passes on the exit code, so you can run it in a pipeline.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, I can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh<span>;</span> sound_status <span>"provision.sh"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>ssh</span> myhost
</code></pre>
<p>Because it passes on the exit status, the <code>&amp;&amp; ssh</code> will only happen when the command succeeds, just like if the <code>; sound_status</code> hadn't been there at all.</p>
<h2>The little things in life</h2>
<p>This notification script feels great: simple, only when requested, and with just a bit of "fun" flavor. But there is another area where I think that a subtle audio cue would help streamline my workflow. Sometimes I need to type 3 or 4 quick commands back-to-back. Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>git</span> commit -m <span>"respond to feedback"</span>
no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
$ <span>git</span> push
Everything up-to-date
</code></pre>
<p>I run these commands, see that it succeeded, shut my laptop, and head out to lunch. Later that day I wonder why nobody has reviewed my code, only to find that the second command had failed because I never staged those files, so I never pushed any changes at all. If I had been more careful, this wouldn't have happened. As a substitute for being more careful, I can have the computer tell me when my commands fail!</p>
<p>When I want is a subtle ping to tell me that something bad happened, every time a command fails. A lot of times this notification will be unnecessary. For example, if  <code>make</code> fails with a compile error, I don't really need a sound to tell me about that. So I wanted a "negative" sound that wasn't too distracting. I eventually settled on this one.</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>Can you recognize it? It's a sound you'll have heard pretty often if you've ever played Factorio: the notification that a building you own has been destroyed. In the game, you'll often hear this sound altering you of an attack while you're working on some other task. Generally, it indicates a problem, but not necessarily an urgent one. I thought it would be perfect. Since I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fish shell</a>, I rigged up the notification like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>$beep_command</span>
  <span>set</span> beep_command <span>"printf <span title="\a">\a</span>"</span>
end
<span>set</span> beep_primed <span>""</span>
<span>function</span> beep_preexec --on-event fish_preexec
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>1</span>
end
<span>function</span> beep_postexec --on-event fish_postexec
  <span>set</span> -l last_status <span>$status</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>test</span> <span>!</span> -z <span>$beep_primed</span> -a <span>!</span> -z <span>$argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> -a <span>$last_status</span> -ne <span>0</span>
    <span>eval</span> <span>$beep_command</span>
  end
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>""</span>
end
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few things worth mentioning here:</p>
<ul>
<li>To set the beep command, I used <code>set -U beep_command "iterm_sound Factorio/alert-destroyed.wav"</code>. This sets a "<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#variable-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal variable</a>" in fish, so it's permanent and system-wide. This lets me change the sound easily whenever I want.</li>
<li>The <code>fish_postexec</code> command runs even if you didn't run a command (pressed enter at an empty prompt), so we use the <code>-z $argv[1]</code> to filter that out.</li>
<li>The <code>beep_primed</code> variable is needed to ensure that the sound only happens once when the command fails. This is necessary to avoid some awkward situations that come up when you press Ctrl-C to cancel a command.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's where I am today. I am very happy with how my notifications work and I'm glad I was able to add a unique bit of flavor to them by sampling from some nostalgic video games. Thanks for reading! If you want to set up something like this and are having problems, feel free to <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/contact">reach out to me</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

Here's a quote from the paper "Document Production: Visual or Logical?"
in Notices of the American Mathematical Society (June 1987), pages 621-624,
by LaTeX author Leslie Lamport:
<blockquote>
The purpose of writing is to convey ideas to the reader.
The worst aspect of visual systems
is that they subvert the process of communicating ideas
by encouraging the writer to concentrate on form rather than content.
Ideas are conveyed by the logical structure of the text;
the function of the visual format is to display this structure.
The author should be concerned with the structure,
not any particular visual representation.
</blockquote>
Here's another quote:
<blockquote>
Document design is a skill acquired through training and experience.
A logical system can apply the skill of a trained designer
to the formatting of a document.
</blockquote>
<p>
Let's see how well this worked for one of my papers,
a paper that was forced to switch visual formats.

Originally I had used the American Mathematical Society's "amsart" format:

But then I found out that the book containing my paper
would use the "msripub" format
designed by MSRI book editor Silvio Levy.
Here's what happens when the same document is formatted
with "msripub" rather than "amsart":

Wow, that's a really pleasant document to read!
I love the huge chunks of white space,
the visually stunning bibliography,
the completely non-functional citations to that bibliography,
the entertaining little black boxes everywhere,
and the line on page 24 sticking not merely into the margin but beyond the printed area of the page.
I'm glad that I concerned myself solely with the structure of my document,
and not with any particular visual representation.
</p><p>
This document must have been first seen by Levy,
who was not merely the skilled "msripub" designer
but also the editor of this particular book.
Surely he was inspired by the document's near-perfect beauty
and thought that a few additional tweaks
would produce a truly stunning work of art.
The scientific editors of the book waited for Levy to act.
But Levy did nothing.
Perhaps the explanation lies in Lamport's wise words:
</p><blockquote>
A logical system forces the writer
to think in terms of the document's logical structure;
it doesn't give him the illusion
that he is accomplishing anything with cosmetic formatting changes.
</blockquote>
<p>
In any event,
I wasn't able to see the "msripub" version of the document until April 2007.
Levy never sent me a copy.
You might think that I could simply change "amsart" to "msripub"
in my own copy of the document,
but "msripub" is a proprietary format:
Levy keeps it to himself.
Eventually the scientific editors convinced Levy to send "msripub" to me.
I fed my document through "msripub" and admired the output.
</p><p>
Beautiful!
</p><p>
I returned to Lamport's article
and discovered that he allowed certain minor exceptions to his "illusion":
</p><blockquote>
Achieving the highest possible quality
requires the ability to make changes to the system's output.
This will be a matter of fine tuning,
changing such things as page breaks and figure placement. ...
[However:]
The changes will generally be of such a minor nature
that they are not worth bothering with
in a preliminary version intended for a small audience,
nor for any document that is not widely distributed.
...
I usually spend less than two minutes per page
doing the final formatting to produce camera-ready output.
This is insignificant compared with the two to eight hours per page I spend writing.
</blockquote>
"Highest possible quality" sounds desirable,
and "two minutes" sounds tolerably small,
so I decided to edit the "msripub" version of my document.
<p>
You might like to pause at this point to contemplate the goals of scientific publication.
Isn't it wonderful to see science propelled forward
by something as small and simple as the switch from "amsart" to "msripub"?
</p><p>
Back to the story.
After many, many, many hours of work I had a new version of the document:

I had changed more than 100 separate lines of the main text,
not to mention the introductory figures, the bibliography, etc.
Many of those lines were quite difficult to adjust:
eliminating one bad line break
often meant experimenting with several different wordings and inspecting the output of each.
"Two minutes" is, I regret to report, a rather severe underestimate.
Could it be that Levy had a different reason for doing nothing at all with this paper?
</p><p>
I spent a few more hours carefully checking the paper
against the old "amsart" version
to see whether any bugs had been introduced by this flood of changes.
I ended up fixing two obsolete cross-references and two typos.
And so, finally, the conversion from "amsart" to "msripub" came to an end.

<p>In 2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation by stacking only (self-)attention layers. Compared to recurrent neural networks, Transformer models exhibit efficient parallel processing of tokens, leading to better modeling of long-range correlations and, most importantly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable scaling in terms of data and compute</a>. Since then, Transformers seem to have taken over natural language processing. Widespread adoption of attention-based architectures seems likely given recent work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale</a> and the flurry of developments addressing the architecture’s quadratic scaling bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Recently, the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> provided complementary post-facto explanations of some of the success of Transformers from the perspective of energy-based models. In this post, I provide a biased overview of (self-)attention in Transformers and summarize its connections to modern Hopfield networks. Along the way, I look for intuition from physics and indulge in hand-wavy arguments on how an energy-based perspective can shed light on training and improving Transformer models.</p>

<p>Let’s start off with an overview of the components in a vanilla Transformer model. Since our focus is on (self-)attention, I am going to assume some prior knowledge<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and skip comprehensive architecture descriptions and experimental results. In <a href="#3-from-hopfield-networks-to-transformers">Section 3</a>, we will start from scratch and use Hopfield networks to build back up to the attention module described below.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-transformers">Vanilla Transformers</h2>
<p>The proto-Transformer was introduced in an encoder-decoder context for machine translation in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a>. The original motivation seems to have been mostly driven by engineering efforts to model long-range correlations in sequence data and the recent successes of attention mechanisms stacked on top of recurrent neural networks. The main contribution and selling point of the paper was making an attention-only approach to sequence modeling work.</p>
<p><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/vanilla_transformer.png" alt="alt text" title="Vanilla Transformers encoder-decoder architecture"></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the encoder on the left and ignore the decoder on the right. Transformer models accept (batches of) sets of vectors, which covers most inputs people care about in machine learning. Text can be modelled as a sequence of embedded tokens. Images can be viewed as a snaky sequence of embedded pixels or embedded patches of pixels. Since sets have no notion of ordering, learned or fixed positional information needs to be explicitly added to the input vectors.</p>
<p>The main module in the Transformer encoder block is the multi-head <em>self-attention</em>, which is based on a (scaled) dot-product attention mechanism acting on a set of $d$-dimensional vectors:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Attention}\left( \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V} \right) = \mathrm{softmax} \left( \frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \mathbf{V}
\label{eq:vanilla-attention}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Here, queries $\mathbf{Q}$, keys $\mathbf{K}$, and values $\mathbf{V}$ are matrices obtained from acting with different linear transformations — parametrized respectively by weights $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{Q}}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{K}}$, and $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{V}}$ — on the same set of $d$-dimensional inputs. <em>Cross-attention</em> takes the inputs for its queries from a different source than for its keys and values, as can be glimpsed from the decoder part of the architecture on the right.</p>
<p>For every input query, the updated output query of \eqref{eq:vanilla-attention} is a linear combination of values weighted by an attention matrix quantifying the overlap of the input query with the keys corresponding to these values. Since all objects are vectors and the attention mechanism is just a dot product between vectors, we can think of the attention module as matching query vectors to their “closest” key vectors in latent space and summing up contributions from value vectors, weighted by the “closeness” of their keys to the queries.</p>
<p>The remaining components of the Transformer encoder block are needed to make the module work properly in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>multi-headedness</em> of the attention module refers to chunking up the dimension of the vector space and having multiple attention operations running in parallel in the same module, yet with each acting on a lower-dimensional segment of the full space. This is a trick to (1) get around the fact that every input vector only couples to one query at a time to calculate its attention coefficient, and (2) provide multiple starting points in the subspaces for the queries, which might help to avoid bad local minima in parameter space during optimization.</li>
<li>A positional feed-forward network, made up of two linear layers with a non-linearity in between, is inserted at the end of the module. Folklore wisdom tells us that the feed-forward layer needs to blow up the dimension of the latent space by a factor of four for it to be able to “disentangle” the represention. More likely though, it’s a way to increase model capacity and warp latent spaces since the attention modules on their own are pretty much linear apart from the $\mathrm{softmax}$-operator used to obtain the normalized attention coefficients.</li>
<li>Residual connections are added to control the flow of gradients.</li>
<li>Layer normalisation is used to control learning dynamics and keep vector norms from exploding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beyond-vanilla-confronting-quadratic-scaling">Beyond vanilla: confronting quadratic scaling</h2>
<p>Most architectural variations of the vanilla Transformer are targeted at the attention module, which scales poorly with respect to the input sequence length $N$. Since the overlap of all queries with all keys is required, calculating a dense attention matrix scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in time and space. Limits on the context window of the attention mechanism during training prevent the model from learning how to deal with long sequences and long-range correlations. The majority of post-vanilla Transformer species can be classified into one of the following buckets<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-rank approximations: truncate the matrix product $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T$ since it’s likely not full rank for structured data</li>
<li>Sparsification: reduce the attention calculation from all query-key pairs to a subset because not all of them feel the need to talk to each other</li>
<li>Recurrence: keep track of a (compressed) history of context</li>
<li>Kernels: approximate the attention operation with kernel methods</li>
</ul>
<p>For the remainder of our discussion, we will focus on vanilla Transformers. One of the goals of this blog post is to explore how a different perspective on the <em>function</em> of attention-based algorithms might lead to qualitatively different improvements beyond what is possible by relying on scaling and reducing computational complexity alone.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide a short history of Hopfield networks and gradually build up intuition until we can recognize the Transformer self-attention mechanism for what it really is. We refer to the <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> for more details and insightful visualizations of pattern storage and retrieval.</p>
<h2 id="classical-discrete-hopfield-networks">Classical discrete Hopfield networks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield network</a> is a simple model for associative memory popularized by John Hopfield in his 1982 paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Networks and Physical Systems with Emergent Collective Computational Abilities</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The task of an associative memory is to store and retrieve patterns, preferably in a way that allows one to recover stored patterns quickly with a low error rate.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the Hopfield network — and other energy-based models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boltzmann machines</a> — is to construct an <em>energy function</em> which defines an <em>energy landscape</em> containing basins of attraction around patterns we want to store. Starting at any pattern, we want to have an update rule pointing towards the closest stored pattern, guided by a scalar “closeness” score provided by the energy function.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/energy_landscape.png" alt="alt text" title="Toy energy landscape of a Hopfield Network"></a></p>
<p>Let’s make this a bit more formal but not too formal. Consider trying to store a set of $N$ binary patterns $\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector whose entries are either $-1$ or $1$. For example, in the case of storing black-and-white images, every image would correspond to a string of pixel values, a binary pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.</p>
<p>For any query $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, or <em>state pattern</em>, we want to find a way to retrieve the closest <em>stored pattern</em>. In his paper, Hopfield considered the energy function</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
E = - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{b} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{ij} \xi_{i} \xi_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{d} b_{i} \xi_{i} ,
\label{eq:ising}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>where $\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denotes a bias vector and the weights $\boldsymbol{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are set to the sum of the outer products of the patterns we want to store</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{x}_{i} \otimes …</p></div></div>

<p>“Most of all, there is this truth: No matter how great your teachers may be, and no matter how esteemed your academy’s reputation, eventually you will have to do the work by yourself. Eventually, the teachers won’t be there anymore. The walls of the school will fall away, and you’ll be on your own.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/2TtGVsm">Elizabeth Gilbert, Big Magic</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very intentional about cultivating peers and mentors who I trust. When I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left my job to start a business</a> earlier this year, one of the first things I did was create a list of informal advisors - mostly experienced entrepreneurs who I could count on for candid feedback.</p>
<p>Still, when I meet with one of my mentors to ask them a specific question, I start the conversation with a warning:</p>
<p>“I have a question, but just so you know, you’re not the only person I’m asking. If I don’t take your advice, I don’t want you to take it personally, okay?”</p>
<p>Every one of them appreciates this caveat because <strong>giving advice is really hard.</strong> In fact, I am starting to realize that you should be wary of people who are too quick to offer it.</p>
<p>The further I go in my career, the more skeptical I am of “experts.” While people with experience may generally make better decisions, I don’t know if their advice transfers the way they think it does.</p>
<p>Now, I realize the irony in offering advice to ignore advice, but my goal is to make you reconsider all advice - including the advice I give.</p>
<p>Above all, I hope this makes you think before you blindly follow others.</p>
<h2 id="1-experts-overgeneralize-their-experience">1. Experts Overgeneralize Their Experience</h2>
<p>Many legitimately successful people got lucky once.</p>
<p>You see this a lot in Silicon Valley-style businesses where a single expert or lucky investment might lead to generational wealth. These successful and wealthy people feel that they’ve discovered the “secret” to building a business based on a single runaway success.</p>
<p>This bias is called <a href="http://iameduard.com/overgeneralization/">overgeneralization</a>, and both advice givers and receivers fall into it.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve read <a href="https://amzn.to/3oy8DSY">Walter Isaacson’s biography</a>, you know that Steve Jobs was a ruthless boss and obsessive about details. Jobs was amazingly successful as an entrepreneur and executive; therefore, you should be ruthless and obsessive if you want to be a successful entrepreneur and executive.</p>
<p>The logical fallacy here is obvious - we can point to dozens of counterpoints - but it illustrates the danger in overgeneralizing an expert’s advice or behavior.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we fall prey to experts who overgeneralize their experience is that as humans, <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">we really like stories</a>:</p>

<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to <strong>understanding complex data and variation across a continuum</strong>. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel cites Jeanne Calment, who lived to 116 years old and smoked every day of her adult life. Jeanne Calment is one data point. <strong>What worked for one person one time many years ago will not work for everyone for all time.</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, many experts <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1284104244891721730">rewrite their stories in their minds</a>.</p>
<p>Take Brian Williams, once an upstanding NBC news anchor and respected journalist. He told a complete fabrication of his experience in Iraq multiple times, including in an especially vivid recounting at a hockey game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7987439/brian-williams-iraq-apology-helicopter">Brian Williams</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if Williams knew he was lying or not, but if you want to believe his apology, he mistakenly inserted himself into a true story that he had seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area — and the fog of memory over 12 years — made me conflate the two.” - Brian Williams (later apologizing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the details of Williams’ story, it’s easy to imagine that most professionals with 10+ years of experience will misremember or rewrite parts of their own experience when asked. This problem gets compounded when beginners ask for advice from experts because they can’t discern the misremembering from the truth.</p>
<p>Beginners don’t have enough experience to call bullsh** on experts.</p>
<h2 id="2-inherent-survivorship-bias">2. Inherent Survivorship Bias</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The Misconception:</strong> You should focus on the successful if you wish to become successful.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When failure becomes invisible, the difference between failure and success may also become invisible.” - <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">David McRaney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Survivors become experts</strong>, regardless of their skills, knowledge, or the repeatability of their experience.</p>
<p>Survivorship bias is one of the most dangerous ones in finance, and it’s one of the easiest traps to fall into when you look for advice. By taking only the positive cases (i.e.: people who succeeded in your field), you are unable to tell which factors were vital to their success and which factors were unrelated to it.</p>
<p>You hear the same thing from people who claim, “they sure don’t make ‘em like they used to.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A commonly held opinion in many populations is that machinery, equipment, and goods manufactured in previous generations often is better built and lasts longer…because of the selective pressures of time and use, it is inevitable that only those items that were built to last will have survived into the present day.</p>
<p>Therefore, most of the old machinery still seen functioning well in the present day must necessarily have been built to a standard of quality necessary to survive. All of the machinery, equipment, and goods that have failed over the intervening years are no longer visible to the general population as they have been junked, scrapped, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Wikipedia, Survivorship Bias</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765755896_survivor.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When survivors give advice, they conflate correlation and causation. Was the fact that <a href="https://tim.blog/about/">Tim Ferriss</a> executed his book launch a certain way the reason it succeeded? Or was the fact that Tim Ferriss had a massive audience of followers before his latest book launch the real reason?</p>
<p>We can’t know <a href="https://pjrvs.com/survivorship">because Tim Ferriss is a survivor</a>. He is one of the few authors who has “made it” to the level he has. By virtue of surviving this far, we have to take all of his marketing advice with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The danger of survivorship bias is that it’s tough to combat. People <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/want-to-really-help-others-talk-about-your-failures-not-successes.html">don’t like to talk about their failures</a>, and failures are subject to the same overgeneralization biases that successes are. In other words, <strong>even if someone tells you why they think they failed, they’re probably wrong.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-the-expert-beginner-experience-gulf">3. The Expert-Beginner Experience Gulf</h2>
<p>Knowledge isn’t discrete - it’s a continuum.</p>
<p>Experts tend to forget that they have a considerable base of knowledge that beginners lack. This experience gap means that realizations the expert recently had will be useless (or even harmful) to beginners who lack the same foundational understanding.</p>
<p>For example, a friend of mine recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and asked me what podcasts I listen to.</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while. Are the software architecture and management podcasts I listen to going to help this guy? There weren’t many programming podcasts around when I learned to code, so I can’t tell him which ones helped me when I was just starting out. Should I selfishly send him the podcast that recently invited me on as a guest?</p>
<p>I struggle with advising new programmers because the gulf between my current level of experience and theirs is too broad. I don’t remember what I didn’t know when I was just starting out; plus, the world has changed. The books I read back then are hopelessly out of date, and the books I read now are hopelessly indecipherable to most new programmers.</p>
<p>This chart illustrates the problem. When you’re just starting to learn about a topic, you start in the bottom-left, and over time you move to the top right:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zxD9C4I.png" alt="Knowledge contimuum"></p>
<p>Beginners need to grasp relationships and patterns, while experts are interested in uncovering principles. The advice experts give often comes from their higher-level understanding.</p>
<p>What’s more insidious about the expert-beginner gulf is that people’s brains actually <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/"><em>shut down</em> when given advice from an expert</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When thinking for themselves, students showed activity in their anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — brain regions associated with making decisions and calculating probabilities. When given advice from Noussair, activity in those regions flat lined. - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/">Brandon Keim, Wired</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the advice makes sense given the expert’s current level of understanding, the beginner may not grasp the underlying patterns required to make good use of the advice.</p>
<p>For example, we typically tell new drivers to stop at red lights. This is good generalized advice, but a beginner may not realize that there exceptions to this rule. What if the light is flashing red? What if it’s red, but no traffic is coming, and you want to turn right? What if you have a medical emergency?</p>
<p>Experienced drivers can make judgment calls based on advice and experience, but beginners cannot. They haven’t developed the filters to process and individualize advice.</p>
<h2 id="4-they-might-be-charlatans">4. They Might Be Charlatans</h2>
<p>It’s hard to believe I’ve gotten this far without mentioning experts who are blatantly slanting their advice towards profit, but I’ll get to it now.</p>
<p>First, what is a <em>charlatan?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A person who pretends or claims to have more knowledge or skill than he or she possesses; quack.” - <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/charlatan">Dictionary.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, most online courses are sold by charlatans. I’m not saying you can’t learn anything from them, but most people selling them don’t have much more knowledge than you do; they just offer their advice more confidently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We now live in a time where information is becoming less and less commoditized and learning is becoming freer by passing days. So, it’s surprising that institutes and “experts” still exist and charge big money for courses.” - <a href="https://thatnameasif.medium.com/digital-marketing-courses-scam-be96464c12e2">Asif Ali</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, most charlatans don’t even know …</p></div></article></section></div>

<p>See the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/antiweb.html">Anti-web Manifesto</a>

</p><p><b>The Webless Initiative</b> is a campaign to make the modern Web a more
livable place. We aim to accomplish this by:
</p><ul>
	<li>Discouraging useless "style" or "interactive" features
	</li><li>Encouraging fast, portable, readable pages, with simpler HTML
</li></ul>
<p>This should:
</p><ul>
	<li>Make web browsers potentially a lot smaller, faster and comfortable<br>
	(realistically, make it possible to use existing small web browsers)
	</li><li>Drastically lessen the necessary bandwidth, making more room for real content
</li></ul>
<p>We plan to provide a set of rules and recommendations for anyone who wishes
to make their web page conformant. There will be an automatic validator for this
ruleset.
</p><p>We plan to create and maintain <b>two lists of websites</b>, with an appropriate
label or banner site owners can publish to indicate their membership:
</p><ul>
<li><b><a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/friends.html">Friends of Webless</a></b>
<p>
Simply by expressing their wish, anyone can be part of this list. The only
condition is that their site is <b>comfortably usable with a small web browser</b>.
</p><p>This might be manually checked, and Webless might refuse to keep the site listed,
if we perceive that it does not meet <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-friends.html">this rule</a>.

</p></li><li><b>Validated Webless</b>
<p>
Membership on this list is per request. The site will be checked
(and may be periodically rechecked) against the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-validated.html">Webless Rules.</a>
Only sites passing these tests will be listed.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
We ask that listed (friends and validated) sites place a link on this page.
This is not mandatory; and the link might serve as a disclaimer for when
visitors are asking why your page is lacking all the modern whizbang.

December 8, 2020 | https://emacssurvey.org/2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://emacssurvey.org/2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>
      

      <p>Also if you have some cool analysis and want to share it, please <a href="mailto:contact@emacssurvey.org">let us know</a> and we can link to you.</p>

And stargazers fear it will ruin the night sky.</p>  <p>But for users in rural and remote areas who've long struggled to obtain internet access on equal footing with Canadians in urban areas, Starlink is offering hope. The service was recently made available to select users for "beta testing," with the promise of wider availability in 2021.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, a fly-in community of 2,800 residents in northwest Ontario, Kejick said he'd become accustomed to download speeds of only 2 megabits per second —&nbsp;a fraction of the 50 megabits per the second the federal government considers a standard minimum for broadband.</p>    <p>At work, Kejick couldn't open large email attachments. He described the service as "deplorable."</p>  <p>At the end of November, Pikangikum became the first Indigenous community to get connected to Starlink, with 60 dishes reserved for homes and businesses in the community in the initial phase of installation, and potentially another 40 by the end of December.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has promised Starlink internet will provide 'near global coverage of the populated world' in 2021.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Hannibal Hanschke/Pool via REUTERS)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Now, Kejick said his devices have been reaching 144 megabits per second. Not only can he quickly download attachments, Kejick said his wife has finally been able to chat with relatives in the Philippines over FaceTime.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's as if you're sitting in the same room," he said.</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, however, Starlink could offer more fundamental changes. Kejick, a victim services advocate with the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, said he hopes victims of crime will&nbsp;now be able to testify virtually, lessening the burden on them.</p>  <p>Members of the remote Ojibwe community hope the faster internet will remove barriers to access virtual healthcare services and education, too.</p>    <p>"It's doing everything that people are asking it to do," said David Brown, CEO of FSET Information Technology in Kenora, Ont. His firm had been working with Pikangikum for several years to try to improve their connectivity.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When he heard about Starlink, Brown jokingly promised his staff he would directly contact SpaceX's Musk —&nbsp;who recently surpassed Microsoft founder Bill Gates as one of the world's richest people, second only to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/spacex-starlink.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/spacex-starlink.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/spacex-starlink.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/spacex-starlink.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A SpaceX craft launches a cluster of 60 Starlink satellites.

So when he heard about Starlink, he signed up in November to become one of the company's Canadian beta testers. Rekounas received an email saying he'd been selected, and received the installation kit within days.</p>  <p>"I've been waiting for something like this for a long time," he said. There have been some hiccups with certain streaming apps, but Rekounas said "in general, it's been fantastic."</p>  <p>SpaceX said&nbsp;there are bound to be interruptions while its service is in beta testing, which it describes as "Better Than Nothing Beta."</p>  <p>Not everyone who registers to become a tester is selected to take part. SpaceX did not respond to emailed questions about the number of Canadians testing its service, or when exactly the firm expects to make Starlink available to the general public.</p>  <p>The cost alone is bound to turn off some consumers. Delores Waye of Taymouth, N.B., north of Fredericton, recently received an invitation from Starlink after her son had made the request.

            <p>In <a href="https://www.saastr.com/whats-your-moat/">What's Your Moat</a>, Jason Lemkin lists several moats (sources of defensibility) that apply to SaaS businesses. I categorised them based on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy-ebook/dp/B01MRLFFQ7">7 Powers</a> framework by Hamilton Helmer and found two powers missing (Cornered Resource and Process Power).</p><p>While Cornered Resources (such as a strong early team) are commonly considered doctrine rather than a moat, the omission of process power was more interesting.</p><h3 id="what-is-process-power">What is Process Power?</h3><p>Helmer describes companies with Process Power as follows:</p><blockquote>Benefit. A company with Process Power is able to improve product attributes and/or lower costs as a result of process improvements embedded within the organization. For example, Toyota has maintained the quality increases and cost reductions of the TPS over a span of decades; these assets do not disappear as new workers are brought in and older workers retire.<p>Barrier. The Barrier in Process Power is hysteresis: these process advances are difficult to replicate, and can only be achieved over a long time period of sustained evolutionary advance.</p></blockquote><p>He admits that process power is rare and difficult to achieve. But is it too rare to apply to SaaS companies?</p><p>On one hand, the path to growing a SaaS business is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/atlas/guides/business-of-saas">well benchmarked</a> and there are processes describing anything from finding leads to deploying reliable infrastructure.</p><p>But there are companies that get very different results.</p><h3 id="the-process-outliers">The process outliers</h3><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> is a popular SEO tool with a fifth of the engineering resources of their biggest competitor Moz. They <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/keywords-explorer-3-0/">claim to achieve this by using an OCaml based stack</a> also favoured by Wall Street traders <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.tinycapital.com/">Tiny</a> is a start-up conglomerate that uses several ideas like simple positioning and No Code to quickly spin up new businesses in record speed. They also run one of the leading design and development studios <a href="https://www.metalab.com/">Metalab</a>, and one of the earliest No Code agencies <a href="https://www.8020.inc/">8020</a>, ensuring excellence in both areas.</p><p>Does this mean that every SaaS company should use OCaml and Webflow or is there a way to create process advantages organically?</p><p>In an industry that speeds things up traditionally with investment, we have ignored frameworks that build process advantages in a capital-agnostic way.</p><h3 id="improving-process">Improving process</h3><p>I'll offer three examples.</p><p>The first is the Theory of Constraints, a framework introduced in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0566086654">The Goal</a>. The Theory of Constraints predicts that every company is usually constrained by one bottleneck at a time, called a “constraint” and releasing that constraint is the key for increasing output.</p><p>Another theory, promoted by Douglas Engelbart is the <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/192/165/">ABCs of Organizational Improvement</a>. Engelbart argues that we should manage not only core activities (also known as “A activities” or “Business as usual”) but have explicit roadmaps for both B activities (“improving how we do A”) and C activities (“improving how we improve”). By focusing on process improvement explicitly, we can create compounding leverage for core activities.</p><p>A more modern example of continuous process improvement is described in the <a href="https://medium.com/quantumblack/the-protocol-series-how-formula-1-pitstop-teams-inspired-the-codification-of-our-ways-of-working-7b59b40a8fa1">Protocol Series</a> by QuantumBlack.</p><p>To summarise, having a great process is not the same as having great execution and we should not neglect that, even in SaaS.</p><hr><p><strong>P.S.</strong> Here is the categorization of the SaaS moats I went with. The high-level categories are from 7 Powers, the bullets are from Lemkin.</p><p>Counter-positioning</p><ul><li>“No Contract at all” easy on-boarding</li></ul><p>Network effects</p><ul><li>Data</li><li>Structured Data</li><li>Partners + Ecosystem</li><li>Agencies and Implementation Partners</li></ul><p>Switching costs</p><ul><li>Integrations</li><li>“Most Enterprise” Vendor</li><li>Long Term Contracts</li></ul><p>Economies of scale</p><ul><li>Using massive amounts of capital to play in every segment</li></ul><p>Brand</p><ul><li>Brand</li></ul><p>Cornered resource</p><ul><li>???</li></ul><p>Process power</p><ul><li>???</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="the-monolith-gets-a-bad-rap">The monolith gets a bad rap</h2>
<p>When you hear that a company runs a monolith, you may think they're old-fashioned and they must have trouble scaling it, right? I'm here to tell you that <a target="_blank" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">some people</a> (myself included) think monoliths are awesome for a whole lot of teams. That said, technology has advanced, and I truly think it's time to revisit the monolith with a new approach.</p>
<p>If you're new to back-end development, a monolith is a server-side system that runs as one.... thing. It's a single program that starts up, serves some network requests, and then terminates. Alternatives to 'the monolith' include service-oriented architectures (SOA), microservices, serverless functions, and probably a few that I haven't heard of. Each of these approaches has their time and place, and I salute anyone who has made an educated decision to build a system with these patterns. I'm of the opinion that a large number of web applications and services would be well served by a monolith.... but with some upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="you-need-some-services-to-lighten-the-load">You need some services to lighten the load</h2>
<p>The reasoning behind the alternative design patterns is very sound. By distributing the work among many different “things”, you make the system as a whole able to handle more. It is well known that by doing so, you introduce more complexity, which requires more effort, and therefore often more people-power and more money. The one possible exception I can see is serverless functions, which do indeed simplify many things, but whose downsides comes in the form of more difficult testing, vendor dependence, or the need for non-commodity tooling. When done right, the extra effort can lead to a very capable system whose benefits are truly remarkable. The classic example is Netflix, and they’ve done very well for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-middle-ground">Finding a middle ground</h2>
<p>If monoliths are hard to scale and microservices are too complex, then how do you design a system that can scale with your traffic and your development team without becoming a pain to operate, maintain and expand its functionality? Over the past few years, it has become clear that a middle-ground is needed. I don’t expect this solution to work for everyone, but most products aren’t serving the kind of traffic that <strong>really</strong> makes the microservice effort worth it.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-sufa-design-pattern">Enter the SUFA design pattern</h2>
<p>Before getting into the core of what SUFA is, I want to mention that this is not an entirely new way of thinking. Things like the actor pattern, the <a target="_blank" href="https://inconshreveable.com/10-07-2015/the-neomonolith/">Neomonolith</a>, and others have stipulated some similar ideas over the years, and SUFA is just one way of combining several concepts into one straightforward design pattern. So, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Simple, Unified, Function-based Applications.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s break that down:</p>
<h3 id="simple">Simple</h3>
<p>A system designed with SUFA can be run in the simplest of deployment scenarios. Auto-scaling groups have existed for a long time, and they’re made even easier by container orchestration systems. A SUFA system can be run on one ASG, or can be expanded with a service mesh to allow for capability groups (which we’ll talk about in a future post).</p>
<h3 id="unified">Unified</h3>
<p>Rather than multiple services who each exist as something to be deployed, SUFA systems exist as one single deployable. This can be a Docker image, an AMI, or some other artifact, but there is only one <strong>thing</strong> that needs to be built. It should be built by CI/CD on a continuous or tagged release cadence, and it should be made available in an artifact registry such as a Docker registry or S3 bucket. </p>
<h3 id="function-based">Function-based</h3>
<p>A standard monolith probably includes a handler layer which is responsible for taking API requests and making calls to a business logic or data storage layer to handle those requests. SUFA systems instead handle requests by chaining together a series of functions, each completely independent and unaware of one another. Functions should expect a particular input, perform some operations, and produce an output to be passed into functions further down the chain. Functions should be easily testable and reusable across different scenarios (such as for different API requests). SUFA systems should also be designed to consume and produce event-based traffic as a primary method of communication.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Well this seems like it should be straightforward, but in SUFA design, “Application” has a very particular meaning. A SUFA system should serve one single application, meaning that it should encompass all of the capabilities needed for a fully formed product. This can be up for some interpretation (such as whether a company should have one SUFA for their whole business, even if they have distinct product areas), but the point is to avoid having multiple “things” serving one application. If functionality needs to be shared across multiple applications, the functions comprising the SUFA system should be easily reusable and composed for other purposes. </p>
<p>You'll notice that this is all very technology-agnostic and vendor-agnostic. SUFA is meant to span across languages, cloud vendors, and deployment environments. SUFA is a way of designing your server-side system such that it is testable, scalable, and secure. You'll notice I haven't touched on scalability yet, so let's discuss that</p>
<h2 id="sufa-at-scale">SUFA at scale</h2>
<p>The critical factor that allows a SUFA system to scale is that it is composed of independent functions. SUFA systems should rely on an underlying framework to orchestrate the execution of these functions such that it can scale effectively. By using a function runner or job scheduler to run the required functions, a SUFA framework abstracts away <em>how</em> the functions are executed, and the programmer writing the code only needs to indicate which functions to run, and in what order.</p>
<p>Additional scalability is provided by <strong>capability groups</strong> and <strong>meshing</strong>, which I plan on writing follow-up posts for, as they deserve to be explored at length.</p>
<h2 id="suborbital-atmo">Suborbital Atmo</h2>
<p>The SUFA pattern was designed in concert with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo">Atmo</a>, which is an all-in-one framework upon which SUFA systems can be built. Atmo uses a file known as a 'Directive' to describe all aspects of your application, including how to chain functions to handle requests. You can write your functions using several languages to be run atop Atmo, as it is built to use WebAssembly modules as the unit of compute. Atmo will automatically scale out to handle your application load, and includes all sorts of tooling and built-in best practices to ensure you're getting the best performance and security without needing to write a single line of boilerplate ever again.</p>
<p>The awesome capabilities of WebAssembly and the design thinking behind SUFA are being harnessed by the open source <a target="_blank" href="https://suborbital.dev/">Suborbital Development Platform</a> to introduce a new way to build your web applications. I've been working for over a year to realize this goal, and I'm extremely happy with the results thus far. Riding the wave of new technologies and practices such as JAMStack and edge computing means that we have a opportunity to bring the best of the old and the new to the next generation of software makers to do incredible things. I hope you'll come and join me!</p>

                <h3>About the video watermark demo</h3>
                <p>
                    This demo application shows how you can build an interface to apply a watermark to a video using the
                    <a href="https://shotstack.io/">Shotstack</a> cloud video editing API. The form prepares the video, 
                    watermark and watermark settings and posts the required parameters to the Shotstack API which takes
                    care of rendering the video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This demo is provided as 
                    <a href="https://github.com/shotstack/watermark-demo" target="_blank">open source</a> code so you 
                    can use it as is, adapt it to your own needs or use it as the basis to build a fully automated 
                    video watermark application that can apply a watermark to 1000's of videos as part of an automated
                    workflow. Our <a href="https://shotstack.io/learn/add-watermarks-to-your-videos-using-code/">How to watermark video tutorial</a>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>If selling products online is a core part of your business, then you need to build an e-commerce data model that’s scalable, flexible, and fast. Most off-the-shelf providers like Shopify and BigCommerce are built for small stores selling a few million dollars in orders per month, so many e-commerce retailers working at scale start to investigate creating a bespoke solution.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This article will look at what it takes to start building this infrastructure on your own. What are some of the areas to consider? What might the data model look like? How much work is involved?</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll explore an alternative: API-based commerce platforms that manage data for you across product catalogs, pricing, and orders—without locking you into a monolith, and without requiring you to replatform.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> A full summary diagram of the e-commerce data model is at the end of the article.</em></p>

<h2 id="who-are-your-customers-">Who Are Your Customers?</h2>
<p>First, you need to consider <em>who</em> will be purchasing items from your e-commerce application. How might you model customer information in a database as a result? You’ll probably want to have basic information like your customer's name, email address, etc. Do you want your customers to be able to create a profile in your system? Or just fill out a form each time they want to purchase something?</p>
<p>Just starting out, a basic model might look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="Basic e-commerce customer data model" width="308" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=154&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 154w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 308w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=462&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 462w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=616&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 616w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=770&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 770w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=924&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px"></p>
<p>If you want your customers to have a persistent profile, then you need to build some way for them to log in to your application. Moving forward with more real-world requirements, you might also want to keep track of their login attempt history and password history.</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce customer data model" width="891" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=446&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 446w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 891w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1337&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1337w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1782&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1782w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2228&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2228w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2673&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2673w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></p>
<p>You might also want to consider whether your customers are part of a large organization; and, if so, how would they like to handle password resets? Do they need single sign-on or OAuth support?</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-addresses">Deep Dive: Addresses</h4>
<p>Did you notice there’s no address tied to a customer in any of the data models shown so far? It might be your first inclination to include a customer’s address as part of those models. However, most customers will have multiple addresses and multiple <em>kinds</em> of addresses, like billing and shipping. B2B retailers might also have to consider multiple delivery locations based on the number of warehouses and offices they support.</p>
<p>What happens if the billing and shipping address are different? Well, you’ll need to do more than just add extra columns to the <code>Customer</code> table! It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>So how <em>does</em> storing a billing address affect the scalability of your application?</p>
<p>If you were to split the payment and shipping areas into separate (micro)services each having their own database, then putting billing and payment addresses into the <code>Customer</code> area would lead to having “chatty” services. This is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/chattiness.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-known <em>design smell</em> when building microservices</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, you’re better off putting the addresses within the appropriate area/service that requires them, but with that, your data model becomes more complex.</p>
<p>One way to avoid much of this complexity is to consider an <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/oms-software" rel="noopener">order management system (OMS)</a> by an API-first software provider. With this software, you can integrate the OMS into your data model without spending months of engineering time.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-organize-products-and-catalog-">How Do You Organize Products And Catalog?</h2>
<p>The first thing you see when you enter a store (either in-person or digitally) are products ready for you to purchase, and usually displayed with some thought for how you might be likely to shop.</p>
<p>For an e-commerce web application, you will probably want to highlight things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best selling products</li>
<li>Trending products</li>
<li>New products</li>
<li>The ability to browse products by search criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing customers with that information means you first need to keep track of a lot of data about your products: their prices, historical purchase data, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a “first shot” at creating a data model for a product catalog might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="Simple e-commerce product data model" width="562" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=281&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 281w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 562w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=843&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 843w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1124&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1124w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1405&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1405w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1686&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1686w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"></p>
<p>Here’s a <code>Product</code> table with some basic information, like a product’s name, SKU, and price. The product is also linked to another table representing various categories that product is associated with. You might also strategically add indexes and full-text search to the <code>Product</code> table to enable site visitors to efficiently search for various products.</p>
<p>This is a decent first attempt. However, to get an even more realistic and useful e-commerce product catalog, you’ll need to support more requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking pricing history so site administrators can analyze trends in product pricing</li>
<li>Supporting related products to display on a product’s page</li>
<li>Incorporating product vendors so customers can view all products sold by an individual vendor/company</li>
</ul>
<p>To address those extra requirements, you might end up with the following data model:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce product data model" width="816" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=408&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 408w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 816w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1224&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1632&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1632w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2040&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2040w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2448&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2448w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px"></p>
<p>This model still isn’t perfect as it embeds your prices into the product itself, but at least it lets you maintain a previous pricing history.</p>
<p>Another option is to integrate your e-commerce store with a <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/promotions-engine" rel="noopener">pricing and promotions engine</a> from an API-first software provider that handles pricing for you. This will let you roll out different prices to different users based on their intent, location, cart, or order history.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-pricing">Deep Dive: Pricing</h4>
<p>While the more complex product data model still has a product’s price in the same table, this may not be the best thing to do in a real large-scale application.</p>
<p>Consider that your organization has various departments, such as inventory/warehousing, sales, marketing, customer support, etc. You might have dedicated systems that allow merchandisers to change the price of an item since they are the experts in determining how much a product should sell for. Similar to the considerations with a customer’s billing and shipping addresses, this would lead to cross-boundary/service communication if we left the price in the core <code>Product</code> table.</p>
<p>Therefore, you might want to store product prices under the data stores that the sales department owns. But don’t forget, there are many different kinds of “prices” that haven’t been taken into consideration yet, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price (cost) when purchasing stock from vendors</li>
<li>Customer sale price</li>
<li>Discounted sale prices</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s suggested retail price</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling all these in context of your organizational structure would require even more exploration and complexity in your data model. While your engineering team could likely accomplish this task, it’s going to take time. Using ready-made solutions can shave weeks or months off your e-commerce data modeling timeline.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-streamline-orders-">How Do You Streamline Orders?</h2>
<p>Now that you have customers in your database and products available to purchase, you’ll need to think about how to design the order-taking process and data model.</p>
<p>The process of placing an order might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer places products into their cart while browsing.</li>
<li>The customer decides they want to purchase the products that are in their cart.</li>
<li>They proceed to purchase the order.</li>
<li>The customer gets an emailed receipt or confirmation number.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s rarely so simple. Placing orders can be deceptively tricky as there are many moving parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>An active cart</li>
<li>Cart converted into an order</li>
<li>A finalized order with confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to look at a simple data model for an order placement, it might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png" alt="Orders data model" width="837" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=419&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 419w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 837w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1256&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1256w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1674&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1674w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2093&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2093w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2511&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2511w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"></p>
<p>Notice that each row in the <code>ShoppingCartItem</code> table contains the “captured” price of the product. When the customer puts an item into their shopping cart should the price at that moment be “locked-in”? If so, for how long?</p>
<p><em><span>Note:</span> How the price functions is a business requirement that would need to be discussed with your product owners, and so on, as mentioned in the "Deep Dive: Pricing" section earlier.</em></p>
<p>The same question applies to an unpaid order. If a customer has ordered a discounted item, should they be able to keep the promise of that discounted price forever until they pay? Or does it expire?</p>
<p>Other questions to consider for an orders data model might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you tracking analytics on orders?</li>
<li>What happens if a customer returns a defective item?</li>
<li>Should you handle shipping within the same data model or have a dedicated shipping context/schema?</li>
</ul>
<p>With some of these concerns in mind, you might end up with a data model that looks more like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex orders data model" width="1112" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=556&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 556w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1112w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1668&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1668w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2224&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2780&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2780w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=3336&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 3336w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></p>
<p>Some things to take note of in this more complex orders model:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShoppingCartItem</code> now supports an expiration date for a locked-in price.</li>
<li><code>ShoppingCartHistory</code> tracks when items are added, removed, etc.</li>
<li>An order item may be returned (this still does not handle cases where 1 out of X items of the same product are returned).</li>
<li>An order may have multiple shipments (eg, how Amazon will sometimes split an order up into multiple packages/shipments).</li>
</ul>
<p>This article also hasn’t even touched the surface of using alternative data storage methods like JSON documents or event sourcing!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To help you see how all the pieces fit together, here are all the diagrams shown together. I’ve removed a number of links/lines to the <code>Customer</code> table to increase readability:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=1396&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png" alt="Summary e-commerce data model" width="1396" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=698&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 698w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=1396&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 1396w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=2094&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 2094w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=2792&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 2792w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=3490&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 3490w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=4188&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 4188w" sizes="(max-width: 1396px) 100vw, 1396px"></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this article still doesn’t even cover many of the basics like payment processing and invoicing. Beyond the features covered here, you might eventually require more advanced features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupon codes</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Third-party integrations with OAuth providers, other retailers, or partners</li>
<li>Shipment tracking notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a data model for an e-commerce application, as you can see, is not so simple. What looks up front to be a straightforward set of database tables is not so simple once you dig into real-world requirements.</p>

                    <p>I put it straight – you do not need to have any prior knowledge about the codebase to start doing code reviews.</p><p>This article is going to be about why all new developers should review code, and how to get the most out of it. If you do not need any convincing or guidance, you may rather watch <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwAa3I-hjkI/"><u>how I win a fight with my cat</u></a>.</p><blockquote>"New developers" in this context are not only people who have just started a career but also experienced developers working with the unfamiliar codebase.</blockquote><h2 id="benefits-of-doing-code-reviews">Benefits of doing code reviews</h2><p>First of all, it is going to speed up your onboarding. Right now, your learning is limited by the number of tasks you are directly involved in — you learn from your own successes and mistakes.</p><p>Reviewing other solutions is a quick way to get around this limit. You can get to know various parts of code without touching them personally and see what works and what does not for different types of problems.</p><p>On the other hand, your feedback will be beneficial to the team because you have a crucial trait that no one else has — fresh eyes with no prior context. <br>As writers cannot edit their own texts, programmers rarely can judge their code. We know too much about why it is written this way, and the more people share the same understanding, the harder it is to have an unbiased opinion. While you have limited knowledge, you are the only person who can give a fresh view and challenge what others take for granted.</p><h2 id="how-to-approach-code-reviews">How to approach code reviews</h2><h3 id="1-do-not-be-afraid">1. Do not be afraid</h3><p>All teams I worked with had a high demand for code reviews, which is quite common in the industry. Therefore, do not be afraid of starting — nobody will mind having one more pair of eyes available.</p><p>It is quite common to fear not catching a bug or merging code that would need some improvements. A workaround is simple — do not approve a pull request if you are not sure. Leave your comments, ask questions, and ping somebody else for a final verdict.</p><h3 id="2-understand-the-problem">2. Understand the problem</h3><p>Before looking closely at the code, familiarize yourself with the problem:</p><ul><li>What is the definition of done? </li><li>Is it complete? </li><li>Would you add anything else? </li><li>How would you test it?</li></ul><p>Think about all possible use-cases the author may need to implement. Then, either remember them or write them down — this is going to be handy soon.</p><h3 id="3-draft-your-own-solution">3. Draft your own solution</h3><p>Remember, we are not reading code yet :-)</p><p>To get the most from this learning opportunity, think about how you would approach this task:</p><ul><li>How to structure data?</li><li>Where to put logic?</li><li>Is there anything in the codebase you should reuse? If unknown, how would you search for it?</li><li>Who is more knowledgeable in this area to advise you if you were the one picking this task?</li></ul><p>Once again, write it down or keep in your memory — up to you.</p><h3 id="4-prove-that-the-problem-is-solved-fully">4. Prove that the problem is solved fully</h3><p>Now it is the time to start looking at implementation but only at a high-level. Focus on <em>what</em> rather than <em>how</em>.</p><p>Sometimes, clear and correct code does a wrong job:</p><ul><li>An author may misread or misinterpret requirements</li><li>They may implement some parts and forget the others</li></ul><p>Look at the list of possible use-cases you prepared earlier:</p><ul><li>Are all of them handled? <br>If not, ask whether they need to be — it is safe to assume that you are the one who misunderstood the problem.</li><li>Are there any cases you did not consider? <br>If the author implemented something you did not even think about, it is excellent — you already learned something new!</li></ul><h3 id="5-compare-your-solution-with-the-pull-request-">5. Compare your solution with the pull request.</h3><p>Now you know how you would approach this problem, but how did the author solve it?</p><p>Find differences between both approaches and try to understand the pros and cons of each. The best way to do it is to ask questions:</p><ul><li>Why was it preferred to put X and Y to the same database table, rather than keeping them separately?</li><li>Why was the primary logic put to module A, while module B has similar pieces that might be collocated?</li></ul><p>This way is how you learn the most — not by reading the code and checking it for correctness, but by exercising your skills and validating proposed solutions.</p><h3 id="6-ask-questions-about-code-">6. Ask questions about code.</h3><p>When you get the answers to all high-level questions, it is time to zoom in and look deeply at code:</p><ul><li>Is it easy to understand or something needs further clarification? <br>Questions from new developers often mean that the code is not as self-explanatory as it could be. The author may consider adding comments or restructuring obscure fragments.</li><li>Are there ways to improve the code? <br>Even though you're new to the project, you can read and write code, right? Leave a suggestion when you see a room for improvement — after all, it can only help.</li></ul><p>People frequently ask where is that line between giving useful comments and nitpicking. Is it appropriate to ask to rename a variable or to chase a negligible performance improvement?</p><p>As for me, everything is alright as soon as you communicate what is essential and what is not. I always prefix minor comments with the words 'minor' or 'nit', so the author knows which are ok to ignore.</p><h3 id="come-back-later">Come back later</h3><p>If the pull request was not immediately merged — make sure you check it for new comments later.</p><p>Someone may reject it despite your approval; someone may add fruitful comments — this is just another piece of context that is never superfluous.</p><hr><p>As always, you can <a href="https://evgenii.info/new-developer-do-code-reviews#subscribe"><u>subscribe to Resilient Systems</u></a> and receive new articles by email if you haven't done it yet. <br>You also can <a href="https://twitter.com/_elergy_"><u>find me on Twitter</u></a> or somewhere else – I am always happy to chat :-) </p>

<![CDATA[Working with Unikernel Volumes in Nanos]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 34 | Comments 8 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25352718">thread link</a>) | @eyberg
<br/>
December 8, 2020 | https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p>Today's article is about working with external volumes for your
unikernel instance. Many applications won't use this feature but there
are also situations where this makes sense.</p>

<p>The most obvious time when you would want to attach a volume to your
unikernel instance is when you are working with a database. Your
database image probably doesn't change that much but many databases can
grow very large and it makes no sense to keep the same data volume in
your base image.</p>

<p>The second use-case is when you have a base image, say a webserver,
and you want to package additional files or configuation as a build
step. For instance some companies will rotate certificates every few
hours in the day to protect access to various services and this rotation
is usually done out-of-band of deploys. Now unikernel deploys for small
webservers are typically fairly fast but the ability to put your
configuration on a separate partition and re-mount the volume on the fly
every few hours is definitely enticing.</p>

<p>Ok, let's start with the code. For this example we have a simple
little go webserver that implements a root filesystem filewalker. We've
declared that there is a separate partition called 'mnt' in the code but
it is non-existent right now.</p>

<pre><code>import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "net/http"
  "os"
  "path/filepath"
)

func printDir() {
  err := filepath.Walk("/",
    func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
      fmt.Println(path, info.Size())
      return nil
    })
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}

func main() {
  printDir()

  b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(b))

  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    printDir()

    b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(string(b))
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to my website!")
  })

  fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static/"))
  http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fs))

  go func() {
    err = http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }
  }()

  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
</code></pre><p>

If you run it locally you should see something like this:
</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

/sys/devices/system/cpu/online 0
open /mnt/bob.txt: no such file or directory
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating a Volume</h3>

<p>Let's create a simple volume with one file in it - bob.txt.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir mnt
echo "Hi - I'm a text file" &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:12:35 volume: mnt created with UUID 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e and label mnt
</code></pre><p>

You'll see that we can now see it in our local volume store:

</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops volume list
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
|                 UUID                 | NAME | STATUS | SIZE (GB) | LOCATION                                 | CREATED | ATTACHED |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
| 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e | mnt  |        | 1.6 MB    | /Users/eyberg/.ops/volumes/mnt:04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e.raw |         |          |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
</code></pre>

<h3>Attaching a Volume</h3>

<p>You can attach a volume to an instance that is expecting one. So that
means when we create the image we'll want to pass any mount points with
the volume label and mount path - this is loosely similar to how
something in /etc/fstab would work. Ran locally you can test with 'ops
run' but you can pass the same '--mounts' flag when issuing 'ops image
create' for images ran on Google or AWS. Let's try it out locally:
</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt:/mnt

Hi - I'm a text file
</code></pre>

<p>Cool! It works! Now let's edit the file.</p>

<p>If you are attaching the volume to an instance on Google or AWS you'd
use the attach command:</p>

<p>Similarly, you can detach as well:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume detach g2 mnt -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>What's really great about unikernel volumes when working on AWS or
Google is that this is all managed for you by the cloud provider of choice. There is no duplicate storage layer
you have to manage like you do in container land. Now you know the basics of mounting external volumes into your unikernel images.</p>

I just finished<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> building a new blog <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>. You're now looking at that blog (I should think). <a href="https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/">As is customary</a> for any new blog designed in a relatively obscure way, I shall attempt to justify my technical choices and also assemble a rough guide for you to build your own "blorg."
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org614ecaa">
<h2 id="org614ecaa">What Doesn't Work</h2>
<div id="text-org614ecaa">
<p>
This is the fourth or fifth blog I've constructed in the last few years. I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for quite some time, before moving to <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> + <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">Pug</a>, then <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify</a> + <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">GatsbyJS</a>, then finally <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> hosted on a Google VPS before deciding to build my current system. I reached a point where I actually began to version my personal website, adhered to semver, and tagged releases on GitLab. I will try to explain, briefly, why each of these setups was either insufficient for my (relatively meager) needs, or just rubbed me the wrong way.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Jekyll</dt><dd>In my opinion, Jekyll deserves its popularity. Few static site generators manage to have as low a barrier to entry as Jekyll has while avoiding cruft and slowness. However, this is also Jekyll's main flaw — there is very little you can <i>do</i> with Jekyll beyond write posts in Markdown, attach templates to them, and publish them as HTML. If all you plan on doing with your website is authoring simple posts and publishing them, and you want to do this efficiently, Jekyll is probably right for you. If you, like me, are never satisfied unless you can push the software you use to near-ludicrous limits, Jekyll is something you will outgrow very quickly. It is very difficult to use source formats other than Markdown with Jekyll — there are org-mode packages which claim to work, but, in my experience, they do not.</dd>
<dt>Metalsmith</dt><dd><p>
My search for extensibility led me to Metalsmith, which uses a rather complex mix of GNU makefiles and JSON for configuration and compilation. Metalsmith, if you are unfamiliar, provides a "black box" which you can connect arbitrary sources and destinations to. You can tell it that you'll hand it content in Markdown, HTML, Pug, and org-mode syntax, and that you want that content converted to HTML, and it will <i>just work</i> provided you have a proper plugin.
</p>
<p>
The main problem I had with Metalsmith is that it is extremely slow. My GitLab CI deployments would oftentimes take upwards of ten minutes to complete, which, as someone who likes to stare at deploy logs as they get produced, was annoying. Also, I made the error to begin by writing content in Pug, which is not a very good template engine and has poor support in editors. By the time I had a technical stack I was comfortable with, I had installed so many plugins that Metalsmith was struggling to cope. Eventually I decided that is was more worth my time to dump Metalsmith entirely and rewrite my content in something more focused.
</p></dd>
<dt>Netlify CMS</dt><dd>Admittedly I did not spend much time here — I was unable to get GitLab's default Gatsby setup to work with Netlify, even though they both advertise built-in support for each other. This may have been my fault, but I did spend some 20 or so hours fiddling with settings and configuration files to get it to work, to no avail.</dd>
<dt>Ghost</dt><dd><p>
Ghost is good software. It is the only WordPress competitor I have discovered which I would recommend to people with a straight face. I am actually currently building a large website for a client in Ghost, based partly on my experiences using it for my personal blog. It isn't as featured as WordPress, but it is <i>much</i> faster, more modern, and provides more out-of-the-box compared to WordPress's "There's a plugin for that" culture.<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After a year of using Ghost, my GCP free trial expired and Google shut down my VPS. While I could have reinstalled Ghost onto a new system, I decided that it was time I returned to static hosting — I missed org-mode too much!

<h2 id="org28431ba">The Road to Org</h2>
<div id="text-org28431ba">
<p>
Org-mode, and Emacs in general, have absorbed aspects of my life in a roughly linear trajectory since I first discovered Emacs in 2012. I have an <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a> database full of thousands of lines of my academic notes, notes on literature, journal entries, contacts, etc. Org's literate programming features simply have no peer right now. When I try to use any other markdown format, I'm uncomfortable at how barebones they all are. Painless export to HTML, LaTeX, presentations, etc. (even simultaneously), backporting of some of LaTeX's more seamless syntactical features to other export modes, the footnote syntax, table manipulation; all of these things I hate to live without and am increasingly finding myself unwilling to. So I decided I would use org-mode for my blog. But this means not using the watered-down org-mode "renderers" that exist on GitLab, GitHub, etc. — all of which are missing critical features, sometimes basic ones such as boldface. I need Emacs to do the heavy lifting.
</p>
<p>
I tried <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> but its setup was tedious to the point of absurdity. I started writing a generator to export org-mode files to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>'s syntax, but this turned out to be equally too much work and not enough benefit. Without basing any generator on org-mode's extant output formats, some of org's strengths (such as execute-on-export for literate programming) vanish. Ox-hugo gets around this by exporting to markdown rather than building a novel Hugo front-end, but in my opinion this is not the right attitude to take towards building an Emacs-based blog. Org-mode already has an HTML exporter, why go through a less-featured middle-man?
</p>
<p>
That's how I arrived at <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html">org-publish</a>, which is [1] built-in to org-mode, [2] supports all features and even allows for some custom configuration, and [3] is <i>extremely</i> simple.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org082d001">
<h2 id="org082d001">Publishing from Org</h2>
<div id="text-org082d001">
<p>
To use org-publish, you simply assign a directory of "source" posts, a directory to export those posts to, and any settings you would like applied during translation. These settings are defined just like any other emacs settings, using Emacs Lisp in your configuration directory or a custom file. The tight integration with regular Emacs configuration means you have free reign to set up the system however you want — for example, I wrote a function which loads a deploy script (also written in Emacs Lisp) before calling org-publish. That script acts as a sort of makefile: calling <code>sassc</code> to compile my <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> files into CSS files and placing them in the proper directory, running <code>surge</code> with the proper settings to deploy the static files, etc. Org-publish includes a feature to generate a "sitemap" out of the box, which I use as my blorg's landing page.
</p>
<p>
Once that is set up, simply calling my function from anywhere in Emacs will publish (export), build (compile), and deploy my blog. No more waiting around for GitLab's CI to spin up; no more 100-commit days where syntax errors in obscure configuration formats brought down the runner, no more refreshing my home page every few seconds while guessing if Cloudflare is just taking awhile or if the deployment really broke (again). And Google won't shut off my server again.
</p>
<p>
For convenience, I'll include some snippets of the configuration I wrote here. However, I intended this setup to be deeply integrated with the rest of my Emacs workflow — I define blog posts with an org-capture, which I have bound to <code>C-c n c p</code>; a lot of my HTML configuration is defined globally rather than just for blog posts; etc. My entire Emacs configuration is hosted on GitLab<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> and is publicly licensed, so you can take a peak at the monsters I've assembled if you'd like. For example, you can find the org-capture template <a href="https://gitlab.com/slondr/emacs-config/-/blob/master/org-templates/post.orgcaptmpl">here</a> and my general org configuration (including all of my configuration for org-publish) <a href="https://gitlab.com/slondr/emacs-config/-/blob/master/lib/org.el">here</a>; note the hard-coded fully-qualified filenames.<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Change that if you intend to remix what I've written.
</p>
<p>
My deploy script is in the root directory of the blog, and contains only two lines:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span>shell-command <span>"sassc -a src/sass/index.sass css/index.css"</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span>shell-command <span>"surge public blog.ericlondr.es"</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Again, note the use of fully-qualified absolute filenames. The key function in my global Emacs configuration is this:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>require</span> '<span>ox-publish</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>blog-deploy</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>(</span><span>interactive</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>wd default-directory<span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>org-publish-all<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>cd <span>"~/org/blog/"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>load-file <span>"deploy.el"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>cd wd<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<code>blog-deploy</code> publishes the blog and then runs the deploy script, returning Emacs's session to the proper working directory afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Take note that there is nothing special about the deploy script. It doesn't <i>need</i> to be Emacs Lisp, I just decided I liked it like that. You could write a makefile, or use some other scripting languages such as bash or Python or even Rust, or include the deployment commands in the <code>blog-deploy</code> function (once the directory is set). That's one of the beauties of this setup — the ecosystem is completely divorced from the static file generation, so any additional configuration or compilation steps you want to do you can just script yourself.
</p>
<p>
The capture template I use for starting off new posts is this:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>#+title:</span> <span>%^</span><span>{</span><span>Name</span><span>}</span>
<span>#+date:</span> <span>%t</span>
<span>#+subtitle: Published: </span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span>date</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span>
<span>#+setupfile: /home/eric/org/blog/org-template/style.org</span>

%?
</pre>
</div>
<p>
When you run org-capture and call this template, it will ask you first for the slug (filename), and then for the title ("Name"). The date will be automatically inserted. To render the dates as I have, eg in this post, customize <code>org-time-stamp-custom-formats</code> and then run <code>C-c C-x C-t</code> in the new buffer. The setupfile listed here will be included verbatim when org-publish converts the file to HTML. My setup file is very basic, but it would be difficult to accomplish this using other features:
</p>

<p>
This loads my site CSS and preferred webfont in each HTML page. It's infeasible to include this in the capture template, because the capture template will not apply to the sitemap (index.html).
</p>
<p>
That's pretty much it. Beyond some specific customizations of HTML flavor and export options, that's more or less all you need to get a robust yet simple blog built in Emacs. I tried to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p><em>Disclaimer: this post is an opinion piece based on the experience and opinions derived from attending the CASP14 conference as a doctoral student researching protein modelling.

Neither the Oxford Protein Informatics Group nor I accept any responsibility for the content of this post.</em></p>



<p>You might have heard it from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">scientific</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/deepmind-ai-protein-folding.html">regular press</a>, perhaps even from <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">DeepMind’s own blog</a>. Google ‘s AlphaFold 2 indisputably won the <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/index.cgi">14<sup>th</sup> Critical Assessment of Structural Prediction</a> competition, a biannual blind test where computational biologists try to predict the structure of several proteins whose structure has been determined experimentally — yet not publicly released. Their results are so incredibly accurate that many have hailed this code as the solution to the long-standing protein structure prediction problem.</p>



<p>Protein structure is at the core of biochemistry, and has profound implications for medicine and technology. Establishing the structure of a protein is a bottleneck in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design#Structure-based">structure-based drug discovery</a>, and accurate structure prediction is expected to improve the productivity of pharmaceutical research pipelines (although it is only one factor, and we will need to get other things right before truly revolutionary changes happen — check Derek Lowe’s posts <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/09/25/whats-crucial-and-what-isnt">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/01/the-big-problems">here</a>). Structural information of proteins is also essential in biology, where it helps to elucidate function — many key papers in biochemistry derive insight from experimental advances in structure determination. </p>



<p>Given the importance of the problem, and the wide network of resources that have slowly been advancing for decades, I think nobody was expecting that a solution would be presented too quickly. I myself decided to focus my PhD research in the field of structure prediction, thinking like many others that several years of work across many research lines would be necessary before we could achieve something close to a solution. I may now need to change topics.</p>



<p>How much of the press release is true, what has actually happened, and how significant is it? There has been endless discussion about this topic in multiple forums. Frankly, I haven’t been able to think about anything else for the past 72 hours. In an attempt to clear my own thoughts, I have decided to write this blog post detailing everything I have learned since my scientific world was turned upside down around 3 pm GMT on Monday. I hope this is useful for my fellow protein bioinformaticians who could not attend CASP14, but also to anyone who wants to hear a little bit more about this topic.</p>



<p>Please bear in mind that my report of the CASP14 assessment and conference will necessarily be interspersed with conjecture. The details of how <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">AlphaFold 2</a> works are still unknown, and we may not have full access to them until their paper is peer-reviewed (which may take more than a year, based on their CASP13 paper). The magnitude of the breakthrough is undeniable — but we need more details to gauge its potential impact.</p>



<p>This is going to be a long post. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>



<h2>How good is AlphaFold 2, exactly?</h2>



<p>Astoundingly so.</p>



<p>Let me tell you the story as it happened last Monday. A handful of hours before the start of the CASP14 meeting — around noon GMT — the organisers released the results of the assignment. Almost immediately, comments started to circulate around Twitter. This is the image everyone was sharing:</p>

One group, 427, named AlphaFold 2, shows an incredible improvement with respect to the second best group, 473 (BAKER). This figure was obtained from the official CASP14 webpage on Tuesday 1st December, 2020.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This bar plot describes the sum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">Z-scores</a> representing the predictions from the different groups. Remember that the Z-score is just the difference of a sample’s value with respect to the population mean, divided by the standard deviation; a high value represents a large deviation from the mean, and is commonly used as a outlier detection procedure. In other words, the groups that are markedly better than the average will have larger Z-scores. In this graph we see that one group performs a lot better than the rest: Group 427, whose average Z-score was around 2.5 when considering all targets, and rose to 3.8 in the hardest ones. If this was an intelligence test, AlphaFold 2 would score an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">intelligence quotient</a> (IQ) above 160.</p>



<p>If the relative comparison is astounding, the actual performance is just as impressive. I am going to consider a typical metric in structural biology, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions">root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions</a>. If you are not much of a protein folder, these numbers may not say much to you. Don’t worry — in next section I will show a few graphical examples. Just keep in mind that (1) a lower RMSD represents a better predicted structure, and that (2) most experimental structures have a resolution around 2.5 Å (<strong>updated 8th Dec:</strong> although, as many have pointed out in Twitter, this is an apples to oranges comparison). Taking this into consideration, about a third (36%) of Group 427’s submitted targets were predicted with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) under 2 Å, and 86% were under 5 Å, with a total mean of 3.8 Å.</p>

<p>We were still digesting this information when the conference started and, oh boy, did we suffer the first half an hour. Claims that this year’s competition was “a little unusual” were followed by suggestions that one particular group had produced impressive results. Finally, John Moult, who has chaired every CASP since 1994, masterfully delivered a nail-biting exposition of the history of the competition, slowly feeding us information until he finally showed the graph we were all expecting. Here it is:</p>

The dark orange line (CASP14_serv) corresponds to the predictions made by fully automated servers, the olive green line (CASP14_w/o427) includes all predictions assisted by humans except for the highest performing group; and the black line (CASP14) represents the predictions by the best performing team: Group 427, or AlphaFold 2. This plot uses the GDT_TS score, where 100 represents perfect results and 0 is a meaningless prediction.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As a rule of thumb, a GDT_TS around 60% represents a “correct fold”, meaning that we have an idea of how the protein folds globally; and over 80% we start seeing side chains that closely resemble the model. As you can see, AlphaFold 2 achieves this objective for all but a small percentage of the tasks.</p>



<p>And then, after three decades of competitions, the assessors declared that AlphaFold 2 had succeeded in solving a challenge open for 50 years: to develop a method that can accurately, generally and competitively predict a protein structure from its sequence (or, well, a multiple sequence alignment, as we will see later). There are caveats and edge cases, as in any application — but the magnitude of the breakthrough, as well as its potential impact, are undeniable.</p>



<p>The story does not end there. The models produced by AlphaFold 2 were so good that in some cases defied the results of the experiment. I will provide two brief examples, based on examples mentioned in the conference. The first example comes from the group of <a href="http://www.chem.umd.edu/faculty-staff-directory/facultydirectory/osnat-herzberg">Osnat Herzberg</a>, who were studying a phage tail protein. After appreciating the excellent agreement of DeepMind’s model with their structure, they noticed that they had a different assignment for a cis-proline. Upon reviewing the analysis, they realised they had made a mistake in the interpretation and corrected it.</p>



<p>The second comes from the group of <a href="https://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/bc/arbeitsgruppen/tidow/personen/tidow-henning.html">Henning Tidow</a>, who was studying an integral membrane protein, the reductase FoxB (apparently related to iron uptake in Gram-negative bacteria). Prof. Tidow’s group worked on this model for about two years, trying different methodologies to solve the crystal structure, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5947774/">experimental phasing</a> methods. When they were given the models from DeepMind’s prediction, they managed to solve the problem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_replacement#:~:text=Molecular%20replacement%20(or%20MR)%20is,the%20diffraction%20data%20is%20derived.">molecular replacement</a> in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>There is one last point to clear. Some people have wondered if Google’s incredible success is not perhaps related to an easier set of target proteins this year. This is, <em>per se</em>, a difficult claim to sustain (after all, wouldn’t other groups with much more experience have also benefited from this?), but to disprove this point the assessors have concluded that the targets for CASP14 were the most difficult to date, based on the similarity of existing protein structures to the targets:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=577%2C510&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="577" height="510" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?w=577&amp;ssl=1 577w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=577%2C510&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Comparison of the targets of the last four CASPs in terms of the coverage and sequence identity of the available templates. On both counts, CASP14 includes the most difficult free-modelling (FM) targets yet provided. TBM stands for Template Based Models.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are still many interesting points of discussion. Many will argue that the set of targets studied at CASP14 is not representative of <em>all</em> interesting structural prediction problems — and they will be right. And, yes, certainly there are some problems where AlphaFold 2 hasn’t performed that well. I will give you my thoughts on some of the caveats later, when we near the end of this blog post. But, for now, let’s be clear on something: AlphaFold 2 is a tool that can solve the protein structure prediction <em>for a very significant number of targets</em>.</p>



<h2>How does this compare to other methods?</h2>



<p>I might have convinced you that AlphaFold 2 is a massive breakthrough. Now it is time …</p></div></div>

<p>I spent a few years working on a project for a big soccer league. One guy on the team had spent some time back in the day writing embedded software for medical equipment. He came from a world where a bug could mean someone dies. </p>



<p>Whenever something broke on the league’s website, say the stats were wrong or live scores weren’t updating, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">everyone lost their crap</a> except for that guy. “It’s just soccer,” he said as he fixed everything. “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">Nobody’s going to die</a>.”</p>



<p>He taught me that sometimes we all need to care just a <em>little bit </em>less.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/status/1264499790865408000">A Twitter thread</a> reminded me of that guy recently. The thread talks about the difference between being “serious” and “sincere” in life. </p>



<p>Ever played a game against someone who forgot it was a game? My grandmother is like that with the card game Bridge. Bridge is not entertainment for her. It’s about pride and victory. She’s “serious” about Bridge.</p>



<p>Nobody likes playing a game against someone like that. It <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">takes the fun out of it</a> for everyone.</p>



<p>If she were able to keep the passion and the dedication but still have fun with it, then she’d be “sincere” about Bridge. Sincere people still care just as much as serious people, but <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">in a different way</a>. Sincere people remember that it’s a game and don’t get all in a tizzy when things don’t go their way. Sincere people know that “it’s just soccer.”</p>



<p>I heard a description of <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/episode/what-exactly-is-stoicism-29467386/">Stoicism on a podcast</a> a few months back. They talked about how life always tries to get your goose, and Stoicism is the art of “preventing your goose from becoming gotten”. That’s sincerity.</p>



<p>Can we stop being so “serious” about the game that is life and start being “sincere” about it? Can we keep the passion, hard work, and growth but swap the upset-edness for silliness and joy? </p>



<p>After all, it’s just soccer.</p>

  <p>This is developers guide for building dWebsites in testnet. It follows an example of making a dWebsite, <code>tutorial.eth</code> in Rinkeby testnet.</p>

<p>The guide is comprehensive, trying to fill in all aspects of making a testnet dWebsites. We divided it into many subsections, so you can easily read only the topics relevant to you.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: testnet dWebsites are not safe! They may be deleted, modified, or removed. When you buy a testnet name there is no guarantee this name will be there the following day. Testnet dWebsites are meant for developers to test their products before putting it on the “real” Ethereum.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-almonit-browser-extension">Prerequisites: Almonit Browser Extension</h2>
<p>You will need the latest version Almonit Browser Extension to complete this guide. It includes testnet dWesbites support.</p>

<p>Install it either versions for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/almonit/">Firefox</a> or for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/almonit/adobfkcnfkodjfobnndpfipdanhdcafm">Chromium-based browsers</a>, like Chrome, Brave, Opera etc.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-an-ethereum-testnet">Choosing an Ethereum testnet</h2>
<p>Currently, our browser extension supports ENS in two Ethereum testnets, Ropsten, and Rinkeby. What’s the difference between them?</p>

<p>Ropsten is an unsecured proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. Since Ropsten is PoW, just like Ethereum’s mainnet,  Ropsten simulates the bests how dApps behave in Ethereum. However, Ropsten is relatively slow (block time 30 seconds, compared to 15 seconds of Rinkey), exposed to spamming attack (where someone spams the blockchains with many transactions, making it impossible for anyone else to you), while not being eco-friendly.</p>

<p>Rinkeby is a proof-of-authority (PoA) blockchain, meaning it’s being operated by a small known group of trusted entities.  PoA blockchains are both very eco-friendly and immune to spamming attacks. However, they simulate Ethereum less accurately, and to get tokens for them you need to use social media (brrrr).</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27048/comparison-of-the-different-testnets">find here</a> excellent detailed analysis of the differences between all the testnets.</p>

<p>ENS is also deployed on Goerli testnet. However, Goerli is not supported by the current version of Almonit browser extension so we don’t dwell on it here.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-testnet-tokens">How to get testnet tokens?</h2>
<p>First, switch your wallet to testnet. In Metamask, for example, it’s done a select box in the wallet popup.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/metamask_testnet.jpg"></p>

<p>We recommend creating a new account only for testnet. Don’t use the same accounts for mainnet and testnet activities, as it’s an invitation for crucial accidents.</p>

<p>Getting testnet tokens depends on which testnet you use.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ropsten</strong>. Super easy! Go to a <a href="https://faucet.ropsten.be/">Ropsten faucet</a>, enter your Ropsten wallet address, and click ‘Send me test Ether’. That’s all!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rinkeby</strong>. We use a <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkey faucet</a>. The process has <em>two</em> steps, meant to protect Rinkeby from spamming attacks.</p>

    <p>Step 1: Make a Twitter or Facebook post with your account address.</p>

    <p><img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/Rinkeby_twitter_request.jpg"></p>

    <p>Step 2: Paste the URL of your post into the faucet.</p>

    <p><img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/Rinkeby_faucet.jpg"></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="buy-ens-name-in-testnet">Buy ENS name in testnet</h2>
<p>Once you have testnet tokens, you can buy an ENS testnet name! We demonstrate the process on Rinkeby testnet, though it’s identical for all of them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch your wallet to the testnet you’re buying a name in (see the previous section for how it’s done in Metamask).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the <a href="https://app.ens.domains/">ENS app</a>. Verify, at the upper left corner of the app, that it works in the correct testnet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the name you want to buy and press search. You can choose between a <code>.eth</code>  or  a<code>.test</code>. The difference is in the purchase process. A <code>.eth</code> name imitates the purchase process of mainnet ENS names, and hence is a bit slow. a <code>.test</code> name is much faster to buy.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: at the time of writing this post <code>.test</code> names don’t work in testnet. However, we leave it here for the instructions to be valid once ENS fix this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press <code>Register</code>, and follow the instructions till you obtain the name.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You just bought an ENS name in testnet!</p>

<h2 id="create-your-first-testenet-dwebsite">Create your first testenet dWebsite</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In ENS App, go to the manage screen of the name you bought in the previous step.</li>
  <li>Press ‘add/edit record’</li>
  <li>Insert an IPFS CID of a dWebsite in the content field. For example, this CID would give you a cool ‘ALmonit Tutorial’ dWebsite: <code>ipfs://QmTXWx6pLwYoX3HUGxyM7qCR3qF9MdtRMcC3fx8qnnUHU2</code></li>
  <li>Press ‘Confirm’ and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="browse-to-your-dwebsite">Browse to your dWebsite</h2>
<p>First, enable testnet support in Almonit Browser extension using those steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the Almonit popup in yoru browser, press the settings button: <img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/settings.jpg"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the general tab, enable the checkbox of ‘Enable ENS testnet Dwebsites’, and select the testnet you want to use.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can surf to your website!</p>

<p>You <em>can’t</em> simply enter the name of your testnet dWebsite, because <code>.test</code> and <code>.eth</code> are already reserved for real DNS and real ENS websites.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to replace <code>.test</code> in your name with <code>.teth</code>, and <code>.eth</code> with <code>.testeth</code>.</p>

<p>So, if we made a testnet dWebsite tutorial.test, you’ll have to type <code>http://tutorial.teth</code> in your address bar to access it. Or, if we made a test dWebsite tutorial.eth, you could access it by typing in the address bar <code>http://tutorial.testeth</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today we're excited to announce that we've joined Google Cloud. Over the course of the past several months, our partnership with Google Cloud has deepened and we believe that our new combined efforts can make our customers and partners even more successful.</p><div><div><p>To our customers, users, supporters and contributors - today, we are extremely excited to share that Dataform is joining Google Cloud!</p>
<p>Before we jump into the story, let us quickly answer what we think will be the most important questions for existing and new users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataform Web will continue to be run and maintained by us, as part of Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will be free for all new users as of today, December 8th 2020.</li>
<li>Existing customers will be transitioned onto the free plan immediately.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will focus on support for BigQuery going forward.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ll be working closely with the rest of the Google Cloud Data Analytics team over the next year to deliver our vision for Dataform within Google Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three years ago we started Dataform with a mission to <strong>empower analysts to manage the entire flow of data in the warehouse, using a single, unified workflow</strong>. Throughout our journey weâ€™ve been focused on giving data analysts and data engineers the tools they need to take raw, messy data, transform it, and put it into the hands of their organization. Weâ€™ve only just scratched the surface of this problem and solving it will continue to be our core mission and focus going forward.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve followed Googleâ€™s products and successes within analytics closely over the past few years, and always felt that they were a product leader when it came to cloud data warehousing, SQL, and now business intelligence; with products such as Looker that inspired us significantly in our own journey. After several conversations with the Google Cloud team it became clear that we are deeply aligned on the importance of serving analysts with the right tools and technology in order to fill what we all perceive as a missed opportunity in existing solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a team of just 7, in a complex, competitive and rapidly changing market, we had more ideas than we had people or resources to accomplish. There has always been so much more we wanted to do each quarter than we could achieve. With the support of the BigQuery and Cloud Analytics teams and our combined thought leadership and efforts, we felt that together we could achieve something bigger than we could separately.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some changes to the product and how we operate over the coming years, but one thing that will not change is our commitment to the principles that we feel have gotten us this far: working closely with our customers, making sure we continue to collect and act upon your feedback, and a laser focus on doing one thing and doing it well.</p>
<p>At Dataform we always felt we were delivering a unique and innovative product to our customers and the data community. With Googleâ€™s support, we have even more confidence in our ability to build and deliver a product that can truly change the way that all companies, large and small, work with data. </p>
<p>In the coming months weâ€™ll be able to share more details of our product roadmap. In the meantime please reach out to us if you have any questions. Thank you again for joining us on this journey. Weâ€™re uncomfortably excited about what we can accomplish together over the coming years!</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 8, 2020 | https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

            For technical founders it is irrationally, obscenely hard to reverse years of programming (ba dum bum) that sales is a value-destroying activity. Sales is CLEARLY a value-creating activity, contingent on you have a value-creating product.
            

            

            </p></div>

            The world will not drop what they are doing to adopt your work. This is particularly true in B2B, where simply building a better mousetrap won't overcome the activation energy required to get people with additional non-mice problems to prioritize changing mousetraps today.
            

            

            </p></div>

            This is very non-obvious for founders because founders are not often people who *want* to be sold to. We often come from a background where trying out tools is a bit of a fun hobby. We like looking at all the options, making charts, and ripping out partially complete tests.

            The process of sales pushes the burden for understanding the market and distilling it from the customer to the sales person. That is a very valuable thing; it is why almost all businesses buy almost all of their big-ticket purchases (including e.g. employees) from sales.

            Simply getting oneself to be comfortable with sales (or at least present as being comfortable for a phone call or two) unlocks a crazy amount of success for founders, because founders have a few advantages over every other sales rep.

            The transition from founder-driven sales to founder-assisted sales generally starts with hiring a "maverick" sort of salesperson; someone who is comfortable extracting what you know about the market, iterating rapidly on scripts, and doing "things that don't scale" to win.

            That is called "asking for the sale" and, while that is a very unconventional way to ask for the sale, a *ridiculous* portion of all energy expended in the art of sales is to get conversations to the point where someone has to actually say yes or no.

  <p>Shopify changes a lot. We merge around 400 commits to the main branch daily and deploy a new version of our core monolith 40 times a day. The Monolith is also big: 37,000 Ruby files, 622,000 methods, more than 2,000,000 calls. At this scale with a dynamic language, even with the most rigorous review process and over 150,000 automated tests, it’s a challenge to ensure everything works properly. Developers benefit from a short feedback loop to ensure the stability of our monolith for our merchants.</p>
<p>Since 2018, our Ruby Infrastructure team has looked at ways to make the development process safer, faster, and more enjoyable for Ruby developers. While Ruby is different from other languages and brings amazing features allowing Shopify to be what it is today, we felt there was a feature from other languages missing: static typing.</p>

<p>On&nbsp;November 25, 2020, Shipit!, our monthly event series, presented The State of Ruby Static Typing at Shopify. Alexandre Terrasa and I talked about the history of static typing at Shopify and our adoption of Sorbet.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DA9gPuBkhFk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We weren't able to answer all the questions during the event, so we've included answers to&nbsp;them&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><strong>What are some challenges with adopting Sorbet? What was some code you could not type?</strong></p>
<p>So far most of our problems are in modules that use ActiveSupport::Concern (many layers deep, even) and modules that assume they will be included in a certain kind of class, but have no way of making that explicit. For example, a module that assumes it will be included in an ActiveRecord model could be calling <code>before_save</code> to add a hook, but Sorbet would have no idea where <code>before_save</code> is defined. We are also looking to make those kinds of dependencies between modules and include sites explicit in Sorbet.</p>
<p>Inclusion requirements is also something we’re trying to fix right now, mostly for our helpers. The problem is explained in the description of this pull-request: <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/3409" target="_blank" title="Allow modules and classes to specify required ancestors #3409" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/3409</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If a method has an array in argument, do you have to specify it is an array of what type? And if not, how do Sorbet makes the method you call on the array's element exists?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on the type of elements inside the array. For simple types like Integer or Foo, you can easily type it as <code>T::Array[Integer]</code> and Sorbet will be able to type check method calls. For more complex types like arrays containing hashes it depends, you may use <code>T::Array[T.untyped]</code> in which case Sorbet won’t be able to check the calls. Using <code>T.untyped</code> you can go as deep and precise you want it to be: <code>T::Array[T::Hash[String, T.untyped]]</code>, <code>T::Array[T::Hash[String, T::Array[T.untyped]]]</code>, <code>T::Array[T::Hash[String, T::Array[Integer]]]</code> and Sorbet will check the calls on what it knows about. Note that as your type becomes more and more complex, maybe you should start thinking about making a class about it so you can just use <code>T::Array[MyNewClass]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>How would you compare the benefits of Sorbet to Ruby relative to the benefits of Typescript to Javascript?</strong></p>
<p>There are similar benefits, but Ruby is a much more dynamic language than JavaScript and Sorbet is a much younger project than TypeScript. So the coverage of Ruby features and expressiveness of the type system of Sorbet lags behind the same benefits that TypeScript brings to JavaScript.On the other hand, Sorbet annotations are pure Ruby. That means you don’t have to learn a new language and you can keep using your existing editors and tooling to work with it. There is also no compilation of Ruby code with types to plain Ruby, like how you need to compile TypeScript to JavaScript. Finally, Sorbet also has a runtime type-checker and it can verify your types and alert you if they don’t check when your application is running, which is a great additional safety that TypeScript does not have.</p>
<p><strong>Could you quickly relate Sorbet with RBS and what is the future of sorbet after Ruby 3.0?</strong></p>
<p>Stripe gave an interesting answer to this question: <a href="https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet</a>. RBS is about the language to write the signatures, you still need a type checker to check those signatures against your code. We see Sorbet as one of the solution that can use those types, and currently it’s the fastest solution. One limitation of RBS is the lack of inline type annotations, for example there is no syntax to cast a variable to another type. So type checkers have to use additional syntax to make this possible. Even if Sorbet doesn’t support RBS at the moment, it might in the future. And in the case it never happens, remember that it’s easier to go from one type specification to another rather than an untyped codebase to a typed one. So all the efforts are not lost.</p>
<p><strong>Does Tapioca support Enums etc?</strong></p>
<p>Tapioca is able to generate RBI files for T::Enum definitions coming from gems. It can also generate method definitions for the ActiveRecord enums as DSL generators.</p>
<p><strong>In which scenarios would you NOT use Sorbet?</strong></p>
<p>I guess the one scenario where using Sorbet would be counterproductive is if there is no team buy-in for adopting Sorbet. If I were on such a team and I couldn’t convince the rest of the team of the utility of it, I would not push to use Sorbet.Other than that, I can only think of a code base that has a LOT of metaprogramming idioms to be a bad target for using Sorbet. You would still get some benefits from even running Sorbet at <code>typed: false</code> but it might not be worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong>What editors do you personally use? Any standardization across the organization?</strong></p>
<p>We have not standardized on a single editor across the company and we probably will not do so, since we believe in developers’ freedom to use the tools that make them the most productive. However, we also cannot build tooling for all editors, either. So, most of our developer acceleration team builds tooling primarily for VSCode, today. Ufuk personally uses VSCode and Alex uses VIM.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a roadmap for RBI -&gt; RBS conversion for when Ruby 3.0 comes out?</strong></p>
<p>No official roadmap yet, we’re still experimenting with this on the side of our main project: 100% typed: true files in our monolith. We can already say that some features from RBS will not directly translate to RBI and vice versa. You can see a comparison of both specifications here: <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/rbs_parser#whats-supported" target="_blank" title="rbs_parser What's supported" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Shopify/rbs_parser#whats-supported</a> (might not be completely up-to-date with the latest version of RBS).</p>
<p><strong>What are the major challenges you had or are having with Ruby GraphQL libraries?</strong></p>
<p>Our team tried to marry the GraphQL typing system and the Sorbet types using RBI generation but we got stuck in some very dynamic usages of GraphQL resolvers, so we paused that work for now. On the other hand, there are teams within Shopify who have been using Sorbet and GraphQL together by changing the way they write GraphQL endpoints. You can read more about the technical details of that from the blog post of one of the Shopify engineers that has worked on that: <a href="https://gmalette.dev/posts/graphql-and-sorbet-and-unit-tests/" target="_blank" title="GraphQL love Sorbet and Unit Tests" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://gmalette.dev/posts/graphql-and-sorbet-and-unit-tests/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What would be the first step in getting started with typing in a Rails project? What are kind of files that should be checked in to a repo?</strong></p>
<p>The fastest way to start is to use the steps listed on the Sorbet site to start running with Sorbet. After doing that, you can take a look at using <code>sorbet-rails</code> to generate Rails RBI files for you, or you can look at <code>tapioca</code> to generate gem RBIs. Since you can go gradual it’s totally up to you.</p>
<p>Our advice would be to first target all files at <code>typed: false</code>. If you use tapioca, the price is really low and already brings a lot of benefit. Then try to move the files to <code>type: true</code> where it does not create new type errors (you can use <code>spoom</code> for that: <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/spoom#change-the-sigil-used-in-files" target="_blank" title="Change the sigil used in files - spoom" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Shopify/spoom#change-the-sigil-used-in-files</a>).</p>
<p>When it comes to adding signatures, prefer the files that are the most reused or, if you track the errors from production, going first with the files that create the most errors might be a good choice. Files touched by many teams are also an interesting target as signatures make collaboration easier. Files with a lot of churn. Or files defining methods reused a lot across your codebase.</p>
<p>As for the files that you need to check-in to a repository, the best practice is to check-in all the files (mostly RBI files) generated by Sorbet and/or tapioca/sorbet-typed. Those files enable the code to be type checked, so should be available to all the developers that work on the code base.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><blockquote><p><em>Tl;dr</em>: The <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express">aws-serverless-express</a> open source project has graduated from <a href="http://github.com/awslabs/">AWS Labs</a> and is now being actively supported and sponsored by Vendia!</p></blockquote><p><img width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/532272/101377847-35c7b700-3867-11eb-9198-4fcaa66ddfdd.jpg"></p><h2 id="about-serverless-express"><span data-href="#about-serverless-express">

        <use href="#link-out"></use>

    </span><a href="#about-serverless-express">About Serverless Express</a></h2><p>Back in 2016 I was General Manager of two up-and-coming AWS Services: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>.</p><p>APIs were already well understood by our customer base, but selling Lambda was initially a little more difficult - not only was the idea of a fully managed, pay-by-the-call function hosting service a novelty among public cloud providers, it was also very different from existing developer practices. Case in point: <em>Express-based web services</em>.</p><p>Lambda launched with support for <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which helped a lot of customers start using it easily, given their existing familiarity with <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>. But for many customers, just having a familiar language wasn’t enough — they were also looking for familiar frameworks, such as <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, on which to build their Lambda-based web applications.</p><p>After hearing this feedback from many customers, we realized we needed to “meet customers where they were” by bringing Serverless solutions to existing frameworks….and thus the <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express">Serverless Express GitHub project</a> was born!</p><p>Over the course of the last four years many developers have adopted Serverless solutions, including Serverless Express, to help accelerate development and gain Serverless benefits like lower operational overhead, automatic per-request scaling, built-in fault tolerance, and pay-per-call pricing. Today, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express">aws-serverless-express</a> NPM package gets over 1.3M downloads per month, and its GitHub repository has over 3.7K stars.</p><p>The original author of the Serverless Express project, <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSbrett">Brett Andrews</a>, joined <a href="http://vendia.net/">Vendia</a> recently, and we realized we can do even more in our mission to help customers share code and data effectively by giving back to the open source community by helping the Serverless Express project “graduate” from its initial location in AWS Labs to a permanent place in Vendia’s repository. As the original project sponsor, and with the guidance of the project’s original author, AWS trusted us to being thoughtful and proactive stewards of this project. We will continue meeting with AWS monthly to gather customer feedback, and be briefed on upcoming AWS Serverless releases so that we may be a launch partner and provide day 1 support in Serverless Express.</p><h2 id="migration-instructions"><span data-href="#migration-instructions">

    </span><a href="#migration-instructions">Migration Instructions</a></h2><p>If you’re an existing Serverless Express user, you don’t need to take any immediate action. For convenience we’ve published <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express">aws-serverless-express v3.4.0</a> that takes a direct dependency on the new official package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vendia/serverless-express">@vendia/serverless-express@^3.4.0</a>.</p><p>This means that by simply upgrading to <a href="mailto:aws-serverless-express@3.4.0">aws-serverless-express@3.4.0</a> you’ll get all downstream patches and features without needing to update your code. Alternatively, you can run the following command  to take a direct dependency on the new official package</p><pre><code><span>npm</span> uninstall aws-serverless-express <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> @vendia/serverless-express
</code></pre><p>After updating the deps, update your code accordingly - e.g., change your imports.</p><pre><code><span>- require('aws-serverless-express')
</span><span>+ require('@vendia/serverless-express')
</span></code></pre><p>If you're new to Serverless Express and wondering how to get started, you can deploy a Serverless REST API to AWS in under 5 minutes by following the <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express/tree/master/examples/basic-starter">Serverless Express Basic Starter on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="whats-next"><span data-href="#whats-next">
      <svg>
        <use href="#link-out"></use>
      </svg>
    </span><a href="#whats-next">Whats Next</a></h2><p>In January 2021 we'll be releasing Serverless Express v4 that:</p><ol><li>Supports event sources other than API Gateway such as ALB, Lambda Edge, HTTP API, and makes it easy to provide your own custom event source mapping for other services that are integrated with Lambda</li><li>Has improved logging and debugging support</li><li>Is more extensible and simpler to use with an improved developer experience</li><li>Uses Promise resolution by default</li><li>Is upgraded to Node.js 10 (compatible with Node.js 12+)</li><li>Makes it easier to work with Custom Domain Names</li><li>Has improved documentation and examples</li><li>Supports Multiple header values</li></ol><p><em>What’s in it for Vendia?</em> First of all, Brett and I feel a strong connection to helping the Serverless community succeed. Technologies like Lambda, managed API and database services, and other Serverless offerings power Vendia’s implementations and help us deliver scalable, low-cost code and data sharing solutions for our customers. We also continue to believe strongly in the mission of Serverless Express: To give developers a simple, scalable platform that meets them where they are, and then helps them gain the best of what the cloud has to offer...without unnecessary retraining, rewriting, or porting exercises. We're also excited to find ways to bring Vendia Share - the next generation Serverless platform - and Serverless Express users closer together with easy ways to use both platforms in combination.</p><p>To all the existing (and future) Serverless Express users, we look forward to making your experience even better. To all the project contributors, we look forward to being great partners, building on your existing contributions and successes in this project. And to AWS, a huge “Thank You” for believing in this idea back when it felt risky and uncertain,and for allowing it to leave the nest now that it’s grown. Stay tuned for more technical and project roadmap details coming soon...and <em>Go Serverless!</em></p><p>Tim Wagner, Vendia CEO (and former AWS Lambda General Manager) &amp;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Composition is like taking two things and connecting them. Not one thing is on top of, embedded or superior to the other, they just feed into each other. Consequently the functions involved are oblivious to one another, which is great because you get to mix and match, test and debug them separately.</p><p>Most composition utils or libraries will generate a new function or object that represents the composition of its constituents, but it is no longer possible to refer to the constituents. You sort of get a new impenetrable box (nesting all over again).</p><p>In typical composition you can continue composing into or out of this box, as long as the composition is done on the sides, and not the individual constituents. However, if you have non-unary functions, you need to start using currying and things may get complicated.</p><p>As humans we don’t think or talk this way, we can refer to concepts arbitrarily and compose freely in a non-unary fashion.</p><p>This work presents the notion of graph programming, a way to program by building graphs of functions from connecting pairs of functions in a non-enclosing way, and aims to replace typical function composition.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>I will use python to illustrate my examples. I will also be using a functional programming style.</p><p>You should be familiar with <strong><em>compose_left</em></strong> , <strong><em>pipe </em></strong>and<strong><em> curry</em></strong> to follow along.</p><p>In case you are not, here are plausible implementations for the first two:</p><figure id="w-node-2597c9518367-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce2dbb35bb5f2e8168c57_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.39.04.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>As for <strong><em>curry</em></strong> since its implementation is a bit less trivial you can use this usage example to get an idea about what it does:</p><figure id="w-node-24bb02446013-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce30681fb5263ead5a8be_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.39.55.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Non linear programs</h2><p>Consider the following situation, where you have the following pipeline:</p><p><strong><em>foo = compose_left(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>foo</em></strong> is a composition of some functions. Great.</p><p>Now imagine the case where <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> gets two arguments, instead of just one. So we can no longer have this composition by itself, and we are required to use currying and an extra <strong><em>def</em></strong> like so:</p><figure id="w-node-ab79ecf119f3-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce3c05e7511ace38ff0da_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.43.03.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Currying is great, because we don’t need to complicate <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> to express that it will get its two dependencies in two different places in the code. <strong><em>side_input</em></strong> will find its way into <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> as <strong><em>arg2</em></strong>.</p><p>Still there is some leakage here. We needlessly expose the rest of the composition code to <strong><em>side_input</em></strong>. This could become pretty messy if I have many dependencies, and I want to give them at different times.</p><p>Consider the case where <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> is a member of two independent pipelines, each giving it a different input.</p><p>We might try to program it like this (which obviously won’t work):</p><figure id="w-node-00fd916ff7c5-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce407256a75d5466fce22_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.44.14.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Calling <strong><em>foo</em></strong> or <strong><em>bar</em></strong> would give us a familiar exception about <strong><em>baz</em></strong> expecting two arguments but got only one.</p><p>We can overcome this with some imperative style:</p><figure id="w-node-ea6e64bb6715-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce43672e5af3fcca58c93_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.44.57.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>And while this works for simple cases, it would not scale to the general case. If I had several functions connected at different stages, I would then have to give up the composition notation and end up in imperative style, or simply have a single large function where everything is exposed to everything.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce45cef0f2f3695f27d2b_Graph_Programming_by_uri_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br></figcaption><figcaption>Complex dependency structure (<em>Image by author</em>)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Imagine having to write a single signature to support the above structure. It would have to be the union of <strong><em>d3</em></strong>, <strong><em>d1</em></strong>, <strong><em>p1</em></strong>, <strong><em>d2</em></strong>. The function body itself would expose the variables globally, and it would be pretty hard to understand the dependency structure.</p><p>As humans it’s pretty obvious how to express it. We just draw it. Let’s get back to the simple example above.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce4cdb35bb578f7169176_Graph_Programming_by_uri_2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br></figcaption><figcaption>No currying needed when you can draw (<em>Image by author</em>)</figcaption></figure><p>We can “code” it too, for example this is the code I used to generate the above image:</p><figure id="w-node-df6a04ac2ec9-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce6299ba3354de8502d28_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.53.19.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So I should be able to do the same when programming.</p><h2>Prographers</h2><p>The word “graph” itself comes from drawing or painting, and this is really the right sense. We want to be able to draw programs, because our mental models of them are nonlinear structures*.</p><p>*The word programming itself comes from the earlier Greek word “prographein”. We are all really just prographers.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyroai/computation-graph">https://github.com/hyroai/computation-graph</a> implements the first graph-programming framework, in python.</p><p>It allows taking pure functions written in plain python, and declare their dependencies explicitly, without them being aware of each other. That is similar to any function composition framework. What cg does beyond that is a few other tricks.</p><h2>Non linear composition</h2><p>The first trick is generalizing composition to non unary functions, and pipelines to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Dependencies are not only “lines”, and so we should be able to, for example, connect two lines into a binary function. I only need to state the keyword I’m composing on to make this example complete.</p><p>An example:</p><figure id="w-node-cba60e3ef9ba-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce64c09e861c77ba2247f_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.53.54.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Each composition is essentially a collection of edges, with some syntactic sugar that allows you to create substructures easily.</p><h2>Memory</h2><p>Pure functions and compositions are easy to work with. They are easy to test and reason about, and are not exposed to pesky state. But still reality needs programs with memory, or programs which are run a few times and retain some context so we needed to introduce state or memory into pure functions. The popular UI framework React has solved this problem using hooks (e.g. <strong><em>useState</em></strong>). We wanted to be more strict in the purity of the functions that we use, and not introduce any magic calls within the function. In other words we wanted the input to be fully described within the function’s parameter, and output to be fully defined as the function’s output.</p><p>We started by implementing a special kind of node, called a reducer. The reducer returns two elements, an output and its memory, and the computation graph framework would give the function its memory on the next “turn”, in a special argument called <strong><em>state</em></strong> (similar to <strong><em>self</em></strong> in python).</p><p>We then realized that this pattern can be implemented in a much simpler way, without any special keyword arguments or constructs. We realized that memory is a dependency into the future. Future here means the next time you run the computation graph. And so we changed the implementation to have something we call “future edges”. Future edges describe function composition in the axis of time. So a function can be composed (namely have an edge) onto itself or a some other functions (even functions it supposedly depends on!), without really creating loops. This is because the value needed for the current turn exists from the previous turn.</p><p>When we introduce this concept, we are no longer talking about DAGs, but general graphs, that may have “cycles” (as long as the cycle has at least one future edge to break it).</p><p>Note that when we introduced memory the signature of the entire computation graph becomes two elements, where one is the output and the other is the state, and when we run it again, we make sure to give it the state from the previous turn. So when zooming out, the entire computation graph has the signature of a reducer function.</p><h2>Logging</h2><p>Logging is a classic problem in programming. We write some code to do something, then we want to watch it and log what it is doing. As an example consider the pipeline <strong><em>compose_left(x, y, z_1, ..., z_n)</em></strong>.</p><p>And say we would like to watch the output of <strong><em>y</em></strong>. So we might do something like this:</p><figure id="w-node-84a627a4fed9-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf05acfb43b949c54f9a5_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.36.46.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But alas, <strong><em>z_1</em></strong> expects to get the output of <strong><em>y</em></strong>. This means we would have to complicate <strong><em>z_i</em></strong> to handle a pair of elements. We would like to avoid it. With graph programming this is trivial to do. Simply connect <strong><em>y</em></strong> into two facets:</p><figure id="w-node-2ba6874af009-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf0969bd80df73e79cd5e_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.37.48.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Async programming</h2><p>Async in python is really hard to get right. Synchronous functions cannot call async ones and so mixing the two is nontrivial to say the least. In addition you have to carefully select when to <strong><em>await</em></strong> in two consecutive lines, and when to use things like <strong><em>asyncio.gather</em></strong>. But this information, of what needs to happen first, is already in your program. For example, the following example is not efficient.</p><figure id="w-node-318eb353e456-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf0e14349776252f3a83e_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.38.59.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This is because we can <strong><em>await</em></strong> on <strong><em>x</em></strong> in parallel to <strong><em>y</em></strong>. But why should we notice it as humans, instead of having it be inferred?</p><p>If we draw it, it becomes obvious.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf14c09e7536fa676e295_Graph_Programming_by_uri_3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br></figcaption><figcaption>(<em>Image by author</em>)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>And so the computation graph library lets you mix async and synchronous functions, and even infers for you, using a topological sort, what can be run in parallel. This would be written as follows.</p><figure id="w-node-7bd05cbe3efa-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf190c24a43a2ec3705b7_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.41.55.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Ambiguity</h2><p>Another cool feature is that you can actually compose more than one option onto a function, making the graph sort of like a nondeterministic model. This implies that the input can come from either edge. To make results predicable, these edges have priorities, so the computation graph will try the more prioritized edge first, and only if that computation path does not succeed (namely raises a specific exception), will the graph runner attempt a different path.</p><figure id="w-node-bfb6f5f3b95d-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf1e7cfb43b66c654fd60_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.43.21.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the above code, <strong><em>g</em></strong> might get its input from <strong><em>f1</em></strong> or if that doesn’t work, from <strong><em>f2</em></strong>. Note we use the lower level API here, but this is very similar to <strong><em>compose_left</em></strong>.</p><h2>TODO: Loops</h2><p>The computation graph does not yet support loops. When it will, they would probably be implemented as a special edge as well. This is still in early planning, comments about this (or PRs) are welcome.</p><h2>Small note: Computation graphs and monads</h2><p>Some of the problems discussed above are traditionally solved by monads in functional programming languages. Because I am not experienced myself with working with monads, I choose to leave it for the reader to determine the relationship of graph programming and monads, and may revisit this section in the future.</p><p>Imperative programming is characterized by iterative nesting. A function has embedded calls to other ones. By embedded I mean that these calls are in the function body, and so there is a tight coupling between a function and its constituents. This has many shortcomings and is typically solved by function composition.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="feature-flags-and-ephemeral-environments">Feature Flags and Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>Feature Flags are a necessary and ubiquitous part of modern software development.  As your company and the complexity of your application grows it becomes imperative to be able to control what features are available to your internal development teams, stakeholders and customers.  In the long-ago, before-times, we would just have a variable that you would toggle between true and false to control behavior of your application.  However, as application development transitioned to the Web we needed the same kind of control, except that hard-coded feature flags just weren’t going to cut it. Enter Dynamic Feature Flags!</p><p>Dynamic feature flags were a big improvement over static feature flags, but also added complexity and presented challenges different from static feature flags.  Gone were hard-coded flags, but they were replaced with if statements and more importantly, retrieving the appropriate flags for your application.  Most people started by rolling their own, but as developing with feature flags gained popularity many different companies popped into existence looking to solve the problems of:</p><ul><li>One interface to manage your flags</li><li>Easy maintenance of your flags</li><li>Very fast and reliable retrieval of your flags</li><li>Splitting traffic to one feature or another </li></ul><p>While companies like LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, Rollout, Split.io and others made it fairly easy to create and manage these flags this doesn’t solve all of your issues.  Many software orgs, especially as they grow, need lots of environments for testing. This poses a challenge to your Feature Flag setup specifically if your environments are ephemeral.</p><p>Ephemeral environments are like any environment except they will be removed in a relatively short amount of time unlike your staging or production environments.  Good examples are:</p><ul><li>Feature branches</li><li>Sales Demos</li><li>Load Testing</li><li>Refactors</li></ul><p>These environments may not last a long time, but they are exceedingly important and can be just as complex as production.  While a sales demo environment may be able to function with seed data, a load testing environment will need production or production-like data and many replicas of each service to give a valid result.  These can be super complex to create and manage and their ephemeral nature can play havoc with your feature flag setup.</p><h2 id="feature-flag-environments-to-the-rescuesort-of">Feature Flag Environments to the Rescue…Sort of</h2><p>LaunchDarkly (and others) recognized this issue and created the concept of environments in their own applications.  You can read about their implementation here.  They have apis that allow you to create and manipulate these sets of feature flags on an environment by environment basis. This works great if you have a finite set of environments and the set of them doesn’t change often, but with ephemeral environments the ability to spin them up and down is a feature not a bug.</p><p>In order to simplify this issue most people create two kinds of environments in their favorite Feature Flag provider: one for development (or test) and one for production.  In larger organizations development teams may have a few, such as development, test, uat, staging, and production.  This works fine as long as you don’t want to add another one or you never take the plunge toward truly ephemeral application environments.  </p><p>Once you move to ephemeral environments most people take the shortcut of assigning every ephemeral environment to a single Feature Flag environment, which is simple enough, but creates a large problem with people stepping on each other’s toes.  </p><p>Imagine you have 10 environments all pointing to a single database with writes happening from all those environments: it’s the same issue here.  The great thing about feature flags is the ability to toggle them and see different behavior, but if every environment is pointing to the same one you now have another resource contention problem.  If you toggle Feature A ‘on’ what’s to stop your co-worker from toggling it ‘off’?  Any issues you have with permanent staging environments are magnified with ephemeral environments.</p><p>The best solution would be upon the creation of an ephemeral environment you would create an environment in LaunchDarkly based on something unique about your ephemeral environment and when it comes up, you would make sure it was using the unique SDK api for that particular Feature Flag Environment.  Let’s implement the workflow and see how that would work with Release!</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/6iJFF3Zu70PwOxkxXCKtp3/24f7412df0886df79f4ff1239d1eeffc/image9.png" alt="FF workflow"></p><h2 id="working-with-ephemeral-environments">Working with Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>In order to try this out with Release we need a repository with a Docker File that has implemented Feature Flags with LaunchDarkly.  I’m going to use <a href="https://github.com/elanderholm/rails_postgres_redis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> repository on Github and you can do the same by first forking the repository so you can use it to create an application with Release.</p><p>Once you have forked the repository you can navigate to <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">releaseapp.io </a>and sign-in using github in order to follow along with this example.</p><p>The steps to get our ephemeral environments created in Release with support for environments in LaunchDarkly are:</p><ol><li>Create our application in Release</li><li>Create a job with Release to create the environment in LaunchDarkly</li><li>Add some environment variables so the application can contact LaunchDarkly and pull in the SDK Api key from our newly created LaunchDarkly Environment</li><li>Deploy our Ephemeral Environment</li></ol><blockquote><p>If you don’t have a launch darkly account, you can create one for free for 30 days to use for this example.  You will also need to create at least one feature flag.  If you already have a launch darkly account with a lot of feature flags you can just skip this step.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/4O6rr31peejXL43aLTPrAi/dc7022076bd7b28e2e189431a5262c7b/image3.png" alt="LaunchDarkly Test Flag"></p><h2 id="create-the-application-in-release">Create the Application In Release</h2><p>Once we are logged into Release we want to click <strong>Create New Application</strong> in the left-hand sidebar.  After doing that we will be presented with Create New Application Workflow.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/5LbYmJLNvAIZwuUqcjMtsv/5aeb59c6fef3b73532e04125a676dd0e/image12_png.png" alt="Create Application With Refresh Button"></p><p>First, we will click the “refresh” button to find our newly forked repository.  Then, we will select that repository and “Docker” for the “api” service.  Finally,  name your application.  Once you have finished click the purple “Generate App Template” button.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/7HFUIDbur1n6r5aELXgb01/f8e12dfed6ca2cb6130fbdb68c98342a/image2.png" alt="Pick your Repository"></p><p>Lastly name your application and generate the template for your configuration.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/WKSmTIAeyTjNKCHLTVbEe/a17a56b380c61066b4fa89fc85690475/image4.png" alt="Name your Application"></p><h2 id="modify-the-application-template">Modify the Application Template</h2><p>Before we can deploy our environment(s) we need to make a modification to our application template and add a few environment variables.  We also need to create a job that will create our LaunchDarkly environment upon initial environment deployment.  Jobs in Release are described in detail <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.  The TL;DR is that with a small amount of configuration you can run any arbitrary script or task in a container.  For example, these jobs are very useful for running migrations before a deployment of your backend service.  In this case we will run a rake task to set up our LaunchDarkly Environment.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>- name: create-launch-darkly-env</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  from_services: api</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  args:</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  - bundle</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  - exec</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  - rake</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  - launch_darkly:create_environment</span></p></pre></div><blockquote><p>The above yaml represents a job in Release</p></blockquote><p>We will place the above lines right before the “services” stanza in our application template.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>memory:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   limits: 1Gi</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>   requests: 100Mi</span></p><p><span>4</span><span> replicas: 1</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  - name: create-launch-darkly-env</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    from_services: api</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    args:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    - bundle</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>    - exec</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>    - rake</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    - launch_darkly:create_environment</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>services:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  - name: api</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    image: erik-opsnuts-test-001/rails_postgres_redis/api</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    has_repo: true</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    static: false</span></p></pre></div><blockquote><p>Place the jobs snippet into the Application Template</p></blockquote><p>In order for Release to utilize this job as part of the workflow to deploy an environment we will need to add one line near the bottom of the file in the ‘workflows` section.

<p>Summary</p>



<ol><li>Every aphorism here is about a Procrustean bed of sorts – we humans, facing limited knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies, and prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences. Further,w e seem unaware of this backward fitting, much like tailors who take great pride in delivering the perfectly fitting suit – but do so by surgically altering the limbs of their customers. For instance, few realize that we are changing the brains of schoolchildren through medication in order to make them adjust to the curriculum, rather than the reverse. (My use of the metaphor of the Procrustes bed isn’t just about something in the wrong box; it’s mostly that inverse operation of changing the wrong variable, here the person rather than the bed. Note that every failure of what we call “wisdom” (couple with technical proficiency) can be reduced to Procrustean bed situation.)</li></ol>



<p>Key Takeaways</p>



<ol><li>Bed of Procrustes – fit person/model to the situation rather than the other way around.&nbsp;</li><li>Work destroys your soul by stealthily invading your brain during the hours not officially spent working; be selective about professions</li><li>Using, as an excuse, others’ failure of common sense is in itself a failure of common sense</li><li>Life is about execution rather than purpose</li><li>The ultimate freedom lies in not having to explain why you did something</li><li>You exist if and only if you are free to do things without a visible objective, with no justification and, above all, outside the dictatorship of someone else’s narrative</li><li>The source of the tragic in history is in mistaking someone else’s unconditional for conditional – and the reverse</li><li>What fools call “wasting time is most often the best investment</li><li>You want to avoid being disliked without being envied or admired</li><li>The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor; the fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich</li><li>You will be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt</li><li>There are 2 types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same</li><li>Social networks present information about what people like; more informative if, instead, they described what they don’t like</li><li>My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill</li><li>Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura</li><li>Life is about early detection of the reversal point beyond which your own belongings (say, a house, country house, car, or business) start owning you</li><li>In any subject, if you don’t feel that you don’t know enough, you don’t know enough</li><li>Regular minds find similarities in stories (and situations); finer minds detect differences</li><li>The more complex the system, the weaker the notion of Universal</li><li>Just as dyed hair makes older men less attractive, it is what you do to hide your weaknesses that makes them repugnant</li><li>Robustness is progress without impatience</li><li>Failure-resistant is achievable; failure-free is not</li><li>For a free person, the optimal – most opportunistic – route between two points should never be the shortest one</li><li>Knowledge is subtractive, not additive – what we subtract (reduction by what does not work, what <em>not</em> to do), not what we add (what to do). The best way to spot a charlatan: someone (like a consultant or stockbroker) who tells you what to do instead of what not to do)</li><li>They think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).</li><li>They would take forecasting more seriously if it were pointed out to them that in Semitic languages the word for “forecast” and “prophecy” are the same</li><li>Economics is about making simple things more complicated, mathematics about making complicated things simpler</li><li>It is easier to macrobullshit than microbullshit</li><li>It is a sign of weakness to avoid showing signs of weakness</li><li>The only definition of an alpha male: if you try to be an alpha male, you will never be one</li><li>The weak shows his strength and hides his weaknesses; the magnificent exhibits his weaknesses like ornaments</li><li>Contra the prevailing belief, “success” isn’t being on top of a hierarchy, it is standing outside all hierarchies</li><li>It is very easy to be stoic, in failure</li><li>A verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence&nbsp;</li><li>Wisdom that is hard to execute isn’t really wisdom</li><li>If something looks irrational – and has been so for a long time – odds are you have a wrong definition of rationality</li><li>Knowing stuff others don’t know is most effective when others don’t know you know stuff they don’t know</li><li>Humans need to complain just as they need to breathe. Never stop them; just manipulate them by controlling what they complain about and supply them with reasons to complain. They will complain but be thankful&nbsp;</li><li>Injuries done to us by others tend to be acute; the self-inflicted ones tend to be chronic</li><li>We often benefit from harm done to us by others, almost never from self-inflicted injuries&nbsp;</li><li>By setting oneself totally free of constraints, free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free of efforts, elements hidden in the texture of reality start staring at you; then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in front of your eyes.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>What I got out of it</p>



<ol><li>A lot of wisdom to meditate on and absorb – best read a couple lines per day to let these ideas sink in.</li></ol>

Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#example">Prisma schema</a> – a declarative data model definition that codifies your database schema.</p><p>This Preview release is the evolution of the Experimental version of Migrate that we released last year. Since then, we've been gathering feedback from the community and incorporating it into Prisma Migrate.</p><h3 id="making-schema-migrations-predictable"><a href="#making-schema-migrations-predictable" aria-label="making schema migrations predictable permalink"></a>Making schema migrations predictable</h3><p>Database schema migrations play a crucial role in software development workflows and affect the most critical component in your application – the database. We've built Migrate to be predictable while allowing you to control how database schema changes are carried out.</p><p>Prisma Migrate generates migrations as plain SQL files based on changes in your Prisma schema. These SQL files are fully customizable and allow you to use any feature of the underlying database, such as manipulating data supporting a migration, setting up triggers, stored procedures, and views.</p><p>Prisma Migrate treads the balance between productivity and control by automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of writing database migrations while giving you the final say over how they are executed.</p><h3 id="integration-with-prisma-client"><a href="#integration-with-prisma-client" aria-label="integration with prisma client permalink"></a>Integration with Prisma Client</h3><p>Prisma Migrate integrates with Prisma Client using the Prisma schema as their shared source of truth. In other words, both Prisma Client and migrations are generated based on the Prisma schema. This makes synchronizing and verifying database schema changes in your application code easier by leveraging Prisma Client's type safety.</p><h3 id="prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing"><a href="#prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing" aria-label="prisma migrate is ready for broader testing permalink"></a>Prisma Migrate is ready for broader testing</h3><p>Prisma Migrate has passed rigorous testing internally and is now ready for broader testing by the community. You can use it with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. <strong>However, as a Preview feature, it is not fully production-ready yet.</strong> To read more about what Preview means, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/releases#preview">maturity levels</a> in the Prisma docs.</p><p>Thus, we're inviting you to try it out and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4531">give us feedback</a> so we can bring Prisma Migrate to General Availability. 🚢</p><p>Your feedback and suggestions will help us shape the future of Prisma Migrate. 🙌</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-prisma-migrate-work"><a href="#how-does-prisma-migrate-work" aria-label="how does prisma migrate work permalink"></a>How does Prisma Migrate work?</h2><p>Prisma Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> and works by generating <code>.sql</code> migration files that are executed against your database.</p><p>The Prisma schema is the starting point for schema migrations and provides an overview of your desired end-state of the database. Prisma Migrate inspects changes in the Prisma schema and generates the necessary <code>.sql</code> migration files to apply.</p><p>Applying migrations looks very different depending on the stage of development. For example, during development, there are scenarios where resetting the database can be tolerated for quicker prototyping, while in production, great care must be taken to avoid data loss and breaking changes.</p><p>Prisma Migrate accommodates for this with workflows for local development and applying migrations in production.</p><h3 id="evolving-the-schema-in-development"><a href="#evolving-the-schema-in-development" aria-label="evolving the schema in development permalink"></a>Evolving the schema in development</h3><p>To use the new version of Prisma Migrate, you should have at least version <code>2.13.0</code> of the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation"><code>@prisma/cli</code></a> package installed.</p><p>During development, you first define the Prisma schema and then run the <code>prisma migrate dev --preview-feature</code> command, which generates the migration, applies it, and generates Prisma Client:</p><p><span><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9dee8cc50b930a017447904d95e15e0e82f9a3bf/426d4/blog/posts/2020-12-migrate-development-workflow.png" alt="Development workflow"><span>Development workflow</span></span></p><p>Here is an example showing it in action:</p><p><strong>1.

In other words, the exact steps of the migration are determined when the migration is created, allowing you to inspect the SQL (and make changes if necessary) before running.</p><p>This approach has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The generated SQL is editable, thereby allowing you to control the exact schema changes.</li><li>The migration is predictable with the exact SQL that will be applied.</li><li>You don't need to write SQL unless you want to change a migration.</li><li>You can perform data migrations using SQL as part of a migration.</li></ul><p>Editable SQL for migrations is useful in scenarios where there are multiple ways to map changes in the Prisma schema to the database, and the desired path cannot be automatically determined.</p><p>For example, when you rename a field in the Prisma schema, that can be interpreted as either deleting the column and adding an unrelated new one or as you renaming the column. By allowing you to inspect and edit the migration SQL, you can decide whether to rename the column (and retain the data in the column) or drop it and add a new one.</p><p>If you're upgrading Prisma Migrate from the Experimental version, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/prisma-guides/prisma-migrate-guides/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project">upgrade guide</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="whats next permalink"></a>What's next</h2><p>This Preview version of Prisma Migrate lays the foundations for the upcoming General Availability release.

<p><a href="https://www.listennotes.com/">Listen Notes</a> is a podcast search engine that allows people to search <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcast-stats/">nearly two million podcasts and more than 89&nbsp;million episodes</a>&nbsp;by people or topics. We also provide a<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/api/"> podcast API</a> for developers to use, which is called Listen API. It has become a core part of our business.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll share with you the journey of building this API business, the technology behind it, and hopefully&nbsp;you can&nbsp;learn one thing or two and build&nbsp;your own API business in the future.</p>
<p>Please note that I use “I” and “we” interchangeably in this article :)</p>

<h2><strong>An accidental API&nbsp;business</strong></h2>

<p>I left my previous failed startup in September 2017. After a few days of tinkering, I picked up one of my fledgling side projects to polish the UI a bit. That side project was<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/"> Listen Notes</a>, a podcast search engine website, which was just a single page React JS app running on three $10/month DigitalOcean droplets.</p>
<p>Little did I know a few years ago that my small, neglected side project would turn into a helpful business it has blossomed into.</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/37454d6afb7b458ca58ae4e5873ddbbd.png"></p>
<p><small>Listen Notes around September 2017</small></p>

<p>I continued to work on Listen Notes full-time and incorporated Listen Notes as a Delaware C-Corp in October 2017. One of my goals was to experience as many facets of business as possible, rather than just writing code behind the scenes.</p>
<p>My initial plan was as follows: (Don’t laugh at me!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a podcast search engine website and make some money from advertising, just like Google. Simple!</li>
<li>If this Listen Notes thing doesn’t work in two or three months, then I’ll run out of cash, and I’ll go into credit card debt to keep going for one more month or so. If it still doesn’t work, then I’ll have to find a full-time job. Although Jeff Bezos’ parents invested $300,000 in early Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg’s parents loaned $100,000 to early Facebook, not every family is able to casually toss six figures of cash at web projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then something happened.</p>
<p>On November 20, 2017, I got an email from the developer of a new podcast app, who asked if Listen Notes provided an API. He wanted to be able to search episodes in his app, but he didn’t want to build the entire backend. I asked a few questions (e.g., how would the endpoints look, what data fields did he need, how much was he willing to pay…). I got his answers. All were in an email thread within a couple days.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2017, I quickly implemented three endpoints (<em>GET /search, GET /podcasts/{id}, and GET /episodes/{id}</em>), which were basically three<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/views/"> Django views</a>. I Googled “API gateway” or something like that and found a service called<a href="https://konghq.com/blog/mashape-has-a-new-homepage/"> Mashape</a>, which was an API marketplace that handled payment, user management, and API documentation. So I put my three endpoints on Mashape and created two plans there: FREE and PRO. I emailed the developer back to tell him the API was ready to use.</p>
<p>This is the email thread that prompted me to build Listen API:</p>
<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/125d913b8ad14bbd99fbc7c1cfe49e04.png"></p>

<p>Then nothing happened. The podcast app developer didn’t use our API and instead phased out their project.</p>
<p>Eventually, I moved on to primarily focus on the development of listennotes.com. The API was basically in self-driving mode on the open web. Anyone who happened to discover our API could sign up, without talking to any human beings.</p>
<p>On January 14, 2018, I got my first paying user. A few more paying users arrived that same year.</p>
<p>Here is the email notification I received for my first paying user:</p>
<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/1cf8ad68f0c345318c9c64b3f370764b.png"></p>

<p>Wait, what is RapidAPI? Well, Mashape was acquired by a startup named RapidAPI. They didn’t rebrand Mashape to RapidAPI completely until mid-2018. Startups typically don’t do things in a clean and methodical way, which is totally understandable.</p>
<p>Then something happened.</p>
<p>There was an outage on the RapidAPI end on November 29, 2018. This was the email I sent to people in RapidAPI when the outage happened.</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/4d1a713f41dd465b9e57fa4e34be4208.png"></p>

<p>RapidAPI had performed a big backend upgrade around that time. As an engineer, I totally understand that outages happen, especially when making huge changes in the backend. But I felt helpless because their customer support didn’t reply to my email. Phone call didn't work, as expected.</p>
<p>Usually their customer support was very responsive; perhaps it was the holiday season and people were on vacation. So I used hunter.io to find work emails of individual RapidAPI employees, the CEO, as well as the CTO. The issue was finally resolved, many hours later. In other words, our API was completely unusable during those down hours. I felt very sorry for our paying users.</p>
<p>Then around mid-February 2019, RapidAPI had billing problems and failed to pay us a few thousand bucks. Our paying users paid RapidAPI first. RapidAPI took a 20% cut. Then they paid the remaining 80% (minus PayPal fees) to us. After several back-and-forth emails and phone calls, we finally got our payment. It’s understandable. Again, startups make mistakes.</p>
<p>In late February 2019, I decided to build our own RapidAPI replacement, for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our API revenue became nontrivial. The 20% cut from RapidAPI was a bit too much for us.</li>
<li>We wanted API requests to hit our own servers directly, thus lowering latency for our users.</li>
<li>I didn’t want to feel helpless when RapidAPI had outages. Overall they did a good job running the service. But I wanted to control my own destiny.</li>
<li>I wanted to contact my API users directly. Using RapidAPI, API providers like me didn’t have access to our users’ email addresses. It’s understandable. It’s like the “Uber for X” companies that don’t want workers and customers to bypass them and strike deals under the table. Marketplaces don’t want users to skip the middleman’s commission fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I vowed to do two things really well for our new API system:</p>
<ul>
<li>We must provide great customer service to our paying users.</li>
<li>We will give customers a very stable &amp; reliable backend service.</li>
</ul>
<p>After 30 days of hard work,<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/blog/listen-api-v2-simple-pricing-same-endpoints-39/"> we launched Listen API v2</a> on March 27, 2019. The legacy API hosted on RapidAPI became Listen API v1, a version we won’t add new features to but don’t want to shut down because some apps are still using it as of December 2020!</p>
<p>We continue to improve our new Listen API v2 by adding new endpoints, new data fields, improving operational efficiency, as well as spiffing up the user dashboard and our internal tools.</p>
<p>Things are picking up speed gradually. I’ve been happy since then.</p>
<p>So, that’s the journey of Listen API so far.</p>
<p><em>Note: Although we decided to move on from RapidAPI, I still think it’s a great service. Startups all make mistakes in the early stage. They fix things and continue to improve their service, which is great! </em></p>

<h2><strong>The technology behind Listen&nbsp;API</strong></h2>

<p>Developers can use our API to search podcasts and fetch detailed podcast-episode metadata. To make this whole thing work, we need to make sure a few core components are in place.</p>
<p>The following graph summarizes those components and the technologies used:</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/academy/image/3c36ff70b8ab4d25aa85bfa567007087.png"></p>

<h3><strong>Datastore and search&nbsp;engine</strong></h3>

<p>This is a shared component with our website. Therefore, I didn’t need to change anything in the datastore and search engine when building our API infrastructure.</p>
<p>We use Postgres as our main data store (e.g., for podcast metadata, user accounts…), and Elasticsearch as the search engine.</p>
<p>I wrote an old blog post with<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/blog/the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23/"> details of the entire tech stack</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Internal tools and processes</strong></h3>

<p>If you’ve worked in any web companies, you probably know what I’m referring to here.</p>
<p>It’s rare for an Internet business to be 100% automatic. A company always needs to build tons of internal tools and set up manual processes to keep the service functional. That’s why companies like<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/retool-nears-1-billion-valuation-with-funding-from-sequoia"> Retool have such a high valuation</a> nowadays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies are investing big money in internal tools that are invisible to end users:</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/e448df5503934491b251a2a85b815686.png"></p>
<p>Credits: <a href="https://retool.com/blog/state-of-internal-tools-2020/">Retool</a></p>

<p>To start our API business, we needed to build (at least) two types of internal tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For data operations</strong>: We needed the ability to keep the podcast metadata up-to-date, fix corrupted metadata, plus review and approve any changes made by users. Additionally, we required a framework that handled new, rare edge cases of corrupted podcast data along the way. To some degree, building a software product means handling tons of edge cases for a very long period of time (e.g., years), rather than launching new features every day.</li>
<li><strong>For user operations</strong>: We required the ability to suspend a bad user’s account, as well as immediately look up all information related to a specific user who contacted us for a specific issue. Plus, we had to be able to quickly evaluate if “it’s our fault” (server-side errors) or “it’s their fault” (client-side errors) when users complained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal tools are used by employees inside the company. Some of those tools are fully automated, such as cron jobs that perform scheduled tasks. But many tools should be used manually by human employees, e.g., when inputting a user’s ID number and clicking a button.</p>
<p>Most of our internal tools have ugly web UIs, with default<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap</a> styling :) The following screenshot displays a portion of our internal tool’s UI that allows us to suspend an API user’s account:</p>
<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/f5c69dcc39a041bdbb230bcc25b3a36c.png"></p>

<p>Fortunately, our API shares many internal tools with the website. So we didn’t need to build too many new things here.</p>

<h3><strong>The analytics and billing&nbsp;system</strong></h3>

<p>The pricing model of an API is typically usage-based. Check out some real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/pricing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.twilio.com/pricing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sendgrid.com/pricing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://sendgrid.com/pricing/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a must to track how many requests a user uses in real-time. We use Redis to keep track of such stats and periodically dump into Postgres for persistent storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if our Redis has an outage? We might temporarily lose some tracking stats. In this case, we have an internal tool to sync stats from raw Nginx logs.</p>
<p>We have to change billing plans without affecting existing users. For example, if we raise prices, existing users should still enjoy the benefit of the old plans. If it’s not done right, it’s easy to have inconsistent states across the board, …</p></div></div>

                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I'm a full stack engineer who works almost exclusively on Macs. I don't have a computer science degree nor do I have strong experience with Linux architecture. This post documents my journey of learning Docker.</p>



<p><strong>If you stick with this blog post, you'll have decent answers for the following questions.</strong> If you've already used Docker, these questions will strengthen your understanding.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is "Docker"?  </li>
<li>What is a "container"? Did Docker invent containers?  </li>
<li>What does it mean to "run a container"?  </li>
<li>Are containers stateful? What does container state even mean?  </li>
<li>Do containers run only one process? Or can they run multiple processes?  </li>
<li>What exactly is "Docker for Mac"? I thought Docker was cross platform?  </li>
<li>Does Docker work for Windows development?  </li>
<li>What are "docker-compose" and "BuildKit"? Why are there so many different applications?  </li>
<li>Most Docker images start with something like <code>FROM ubuntu</code>. Is my container running a full Ubuntu operating system? If not, why is it <em>from</em> Ubuntu? In fact, what does it even mean to "run an operating system?"</li>
</ol>

<p>The summarized answers for all of these questions are at the end of this post.</p>



<p>How might you <a href="https://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people/">explain React.js</a> to a newcomer? You <em>could</em> say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think this would help a newcomer form a mental model of React, as it's <strong>too high level</strong>. You could also say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is a declarative DSL that outputs a tree-like "virtual DOM," mutating the DOM (or another view target) with O(n) reconciliation performance, as a pure function of component state and props</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think, justifiably, the newcomer would slap you in the face, because you just told them to go to hell.</p>

<p>Something more approachable is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is mainly a Javascript library that takes in data, like a username, and spits out HTML based on that data. It gives you a performant way to update the view in real time based on changes to that data. React can do a lot more than this, but the most common use case is taking in data and spitting out HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this accurately describe all of React? No, and once someone dives in, they'll have to learn the intricacies of the API. But it's more <strong>approachable.</strong></p>

<p>I find the Docker documentation is written by, and targeted to, people who already have a deeper understanding of Linux fundamentals, virtualization, and kernels versus operating systems.</p>

<p>If someone tells you that Docker is "cgroups and namespaces" with no other information, it's technically accurate, but not approachable.</p>



<p>If you just want to build web servers, why care about Docker at all? Well, I've personally encountered many of the issues containers claim to solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requiring multiple versions of <strong>userland libraries</strong> (like Node, and also npm packages) in different repositories, causing conflicts for local development because they aren't isolated</li>
<li>Requiring <strong>multiple service or database versions</strong> causing conflict in local development (have you ever tried to run two versions of MySQL on a Mac using Homebrew?)</li>
<li>Running into <strong>dependency installation issues</strong> when checking out both old and new projects (Ruby / Rails are particularly bad at this, damn you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/33996523/743464">Nokogiri</a>). Who hasn't run an old project only to learn everything is broken?</li>
<li>Needing to <strong>easily run multiple services</strong> for local development, some of which need multiple commands (such as both a server process and a static file builder process like Webpack)</li>
<li>Losing <strong>parity between environments</strong> due to version or process execution discrepancies, making it impossible to reproduce situations that cause some production bugs</li>
</ul>



<p>This post <strong>isn't</strong> a deep dive on Docker's API. We won't explain the syntax of <code>Dockerfile</code>s, <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files, nor the CLI. We also won't talk much about "orchestration," the verb used to describe running multiple containers and their dependencies and dealing with things like networking and automatically restarting containers.</p>



<h4 id="whatisdocker">What is Docker?</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, let's start with the Docker logo. It's great for our mental model!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2020/05/Moby-logo.png" alt="The Docker Logo, which is a whale with a stack of shipping containers on its back"></p>

<p>We have a whale carrying some shipping containers. (His name is "Moby Dock," <strong>Moby</strong> for short). He's a whale because, a long time ago, he beat out other animals in <a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/create-cool-open-source-project-logo-219415/entries">a community logo design contest</a>.</p>

<p>In our mental model, the whale is Docker. <strong>Docker is a <em>platform</em>.</strong> It's not one thing, it's a collection of different technologies and standards that provide a platform to <strong>run containers!</strong> The whale is supporting, or "running" containers. We'll learn more about "containers" soon.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2014/Oct/key.png#inline-block" alt="Key icon" title=""> <strong>Key concept:</strong> Docker is a platform, including online hosting, and a suite of local tools, like <code>docker-compose</code> and the Docker engine.</p>

<p>When learning Docker, you might wonder what the "right" or "Docker" way is. By viewing Docker as a platform, we realize there are multiple ways to do things. <strong>It's like Git:</strong> Git is a platform and suite of command line tools. In Git there are different ways to use the suite of tools. Some people use forks, some use feature branches, some use rebasing, some use merging. Docker provides you tools to build "images" and "run" "containers," with multiple ways to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>"Docker" also means the <strong>company.</strong> I think this overloading makes learning Docker confusing. The Docker <em>platform</em> is <a href="https://github.com/docker">entirely open source</a>, so what does the company do? It makes money by <a href="https://hub.docker.com/pricing">charging for private hosting and management tools</a>, and offering <a href="https://hub.docker.com/pricing">enterprise services</a> for complex image/container management.</p>

<p>An aside: In 2019 Docker was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/">acquired</a> by a company named <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/software/mcp/">Mirantis</a> which makes money by supporting cloud application development around Kubernetes.</p>



<h4 id="whatisacontainerdiddockerinventcontainers">What is a "container"? Did Docker invent containers?</h4>

<p>Containers were the most difficult part of Docker for me to understand. I had some idea they were running a process in isolation, but I didn't really know what that meant. To answer this, let's make sure we understand the Docker platform by looking at a different question.</p>

<h4 id="whatexactlyisdockerformacithoughtdockerworkedonallplatforms">What exactly is "Docker for Mac?" I thought Docker worked on all platforms?</h4>

<p>I initially thought Docker was "cross platform." This is both true and a complete, filthy lie.</p>

<p>Take Docker for Mac out of the equation and pretend like you're developing directly on a Linux operating system, like Ubuntu. All operating systems have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)"><strong>kernel</strong></a>", the core computer program of the operating system that controls everything and facilitates access to hardware.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel has features that allow you to run processes (computer programs) in "isolation":</p>

<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/ch01">Control groups</a>", usually called "cgroups," let you run a Linux process with a specifically allocated set of resources, such as how much memory it has.</li>
<li>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">Namespaces</a>", which add additional isolation, like making your process look like it's the only one on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2014/Oct/key.png#inline-block" alt="Key icon" title=""> <strong>Key concept:</strong>
Docker uses existing Linux features to run containers. These features <strong>only</strong> work on Linux. MacOS and Windows don't have cgroups nor namespaces.</p>

<p>So what is Docker for Mac, if these technologies only exist on Linux? Docker for Mac runs a full <strong>Linux "virtual machine."</strong> Virtual machines are a broader topic, but they contain full operating systems, including kernels, so we have access to these Linux features.</p>

<p>My mental image is the whale icon on my Mac's status bar holds a little Linux computer.</p>

<p>This also has the implication that the most common type of application developed with Docker is an application <em>for</em> Linux. For example, you <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/607443/can-mac-os-x-be-run-inside-docker">can't run a Mac native application</a> like Photoshop in a Docker container. On Windows there's Docker container support for both Windows (.exe) applications as well as Linux applications, but they use different underlying technologies. And you can't run a Windows container on a Mac. See what I mean about Docker not really being "cross platform"?</p>

<p>On Mac and Windows, the Linux virtual machine is hidden from you as an implementation detail. You can typically SSH into computers and run commands on them. Docker for Mac <strong>doesn't let you directly SSH into this virtual machine.</strong> Instead, the Docker commands you run locally are what coordinate sending files and commands into this Linux virtual machine.</p>

<p>Finally, did Docker invent containers? No, containers are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_containers">general concept</a>. <strong>Docker didn't invent containers.</strong> You can create and run containers <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/26/running-container-without-docker/">without Docker</a>. Cgroups and namespaces also aren't the only way to run processes in isolation, they're just the tools Docker uses.</p>

<h4 id="sodoesdockerworkonwindows">So does Docker work on Windows?</h4>

<p>The <a href="" windows="" container"="" https:="" www.youtube.com="" watch?v="8gG6_Xr68D8" are="" the"="">official Docker Enterprise video, at 0:45,</a> mentions "Windows containers." So you <em>can</em> use Docker on Windows?</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by "use on Windows." If you're developing Linux applications, then <strong>Docker for Windows does the same thing as Docker for Mac,</strong> it runs a Linux virtual machine, and you communicate with that.</p>

<p>If however you want to develop an application that only runs on Windows, like a file ending in ".exe," you have to run your containers on a Windows host somehow. This is supported by Docker Enterprise, but much less common.</p>

<h4 id="whatdoesitmeantorunacontainer">What does it mean to "run a container"?</h4>

<p>"Container" is a noun. What we've talked about so far is the verb of "running" a container.</p>

<p><strong>Recap:</strong> When Docker runs your container, it starts your process (your computer program, developed for Linux architecture) wrapped in suite of Linux kernel tools to make it look like it's the only process on the system. Docker for Mac (and Windows) provide a Linux virtual machine so you can use these technologies. Running the container is basically the same as what you'd do on your host machine (like <code>npm start</code> or <code>rails s</code>), it's just in "isolation" inside the Linux VM.</p>

<p>Let's poke at containers a little more to strengthen our understanding.</p>

<h4 id="docontainershave_only_oneprocessorcantheyhavemultipleprocesses">Do containers have <em>only</em> one process? Or can they have multiple processes?</h4>

<p>Let's check! First let's install <code>htop</code>, the awesome process viewer on your Mac (not in a container): <code>brew install htop</code>.</p>

<p>Now run <code>htop</code> on your Mac. If you haven't used <code>htop</code>, don't worry too much about the interface, just note you see all sorts of processes running:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-8.42.50-PM.png" alt="A screenshot of htop running on Mac, showing multiple processes"></p>

          <h2 id="changing-license-from-gplv3-to-apache-20-terminusdb">Changing License from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0: TerminusDB</h2>

<p>We have decided to re-license TerminusDB from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0. We want independent software developers (ISVs) to embed TerminusDB in their applications and those developers feel that Apache is a lower risk option. The substantive points of practical difference are far less important – sufficient people believe it to be true and sufficient lawyers have advised teams to be wary of GPL.</p>

<p>In our experience, ISVs and devs in large companies/institutions size up their options at project conception and there remains a niggling doubt that ‘GPL might limit commercial prospects and cause me headaches’. The world has changed – and code freedom is being overtaken by developer freedom.</p>

<p>Open-source software is everywhere. It’s eating the world. In the top 10 databases on <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">DB-Engines</a>, the remaining proprietary databases were released in 1980 (Oracle), 1983 (IBM Db2) and 1989 (Microsoft SQL Server). It is hard to imagine another non-OSS database ever entering the top 10.</p>

<p>We had hoped that our association with the principals of the free software movement would result in community adoption and contribution, but that hasn’t really been the case. We see limited community input that relates to our choice of GPL. That might not be too surprising as when you investigate which license to choose on Stackoverflow, you get popular but wrong-headed comments like:</p>

<p><code>the GNU/GPL bunch are generally extremists when you encounter them in the wild.</code></p>

<p><code>don’t use GPL if you want your project to be commercial</code></p>

<p>With the shift to Apache, TerminusDB is, in a sense, becoming more open source as we are removing restrictions on how you can use the software.</p>

<h3 id="debate">Debate</h3>

<p>The core TerminusDB team had a long debate about licenses before the release of 1.0 last year. The main topics of discussion were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The risks of a cloud provider forking the code then hosting the database</li>
<li>What open source means to TerminusDB as a group</li>
<li>What we, as a community of devs and users, are most comfortable with</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-the-big-bad-cloud-providers">1. The big bad cloud providers</h4>

<p>In the past there was an unwritten rule, that big platforms wouldn’t come along and fork open source code and deliver the same product as a service. Unfortunately, those days are gone. AWS in particular has actively sought to offer very similar services to open source products. This led to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/">Confluent</a> (among others) changing their licences to variations of ‘server side’ and moving away from the open-source tradition. They try to say ‘we are still open source, we are just forbidding a specific type of action’, but it can feel like window dressing for ‘we want to sweat our assets’.</p>

<p>Mongo, for example, is hardly suffering – it’s valued at over $15 billion. With such vast resources, they should be (and are) able to compete in the provision of their own database. MongoDB’s technology is more than competitive with AWS’ DocumentDB, and Mongo’s Atlas DBaaS - which runs on AWS infra - has been a huge success.</p>

<p>I’m sure our perspective will shift over time, but from where we’re standing, having a cloud provider launch a competing service would be a sign of enormous success. (And this is not to say that the cloud providers’ parasitic approach to OSS projects is not a genuine problem, it simply acknowledges that you have to be a widely used OSS project before it *becomes* a problem).</p>

<h3 id="2-free-software">2. Free software</h3>

<p>We don’t think it should be our job to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We do think that the software community should be able to access and use TerminusDB.</p>

<p>In 1974 software became copyrightable in the USA. It subsequently became obvious that researchers were giving out software for free, but businesses were not giving back. GNU/GPL came along to provide a new framework for that interface – the software would be free as in freedom (libre). Everybody would be free to modify and distribute, but proprietary additions would not be allowed.</p>

<p>The problem of businesses not giving back remains today.</p>

<p>GPL and copyleft provisions work well when they dominate open-source, but their waning popularity increases the ability for ISVs and corporates to go for more open licensing and for legal teams to write anti-GPL provisions into internal rules. Only significant developer push back can change that reality (and why push back when there are so many OSS options with permissive licenses).</p>

<p>Maybe if <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MySQL">MySQL</a>, its offshoot <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MariaDB">MariaDB</a>, and our graph brothers <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/Neo4j">Neo4j</a> weren’t the only GPL flag flyers in the top 20 databases, it might be easier to gain adoption with GPL; however, the other big OSS players: Postgres, Cassandra, Elastic &amp; Redis all go for less restrictive licenses.</p>

<p>The Affero GPL (AGPL) is treated as an even greater pariah than the GPLv3. The Google internal policy] bans all use of AGPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It reminds of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13421608">this HN comment</a> on the <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">excellent postmortem</a> of the demise of RethinkDB (recommended reading for all OSS folk):</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-hn.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Our graph database brothers and sisters in <a href="https://neo4j.com/open-core-and-neo4j/">Neo4j moved</a> from the AGPL to ‘AGPL with a commons clause’ to GPLv3 to making some of the code proprietary. Getting the right license for an OSS project that also allows for some commercialization is far from straightforward. (As Neo certainly know – check out this <a href="https://public.igovsol.com/neo4j-court-records/graphfoundation/80-main.pdf">current court case about the formerly GPL enterprise code</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn">Grakn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree/db">Fluree</a> are seeing some success with the AGPL. We genuinely wish them well as we know it is a hard path to walk.</p>



<p>We did get some negative feedback about the GPL prior to launch. Some people working in corporates weren’t comfortable and thought that it would prevent them from using Terminus. Our response was – <strong>we didn’t develop for them</strong>. And that remains the case; however, the GPL skeptical environment is pervasive. There is a person who tweets TerminusDB after every release asking when the Apache version will land – I always ask him why he thinks he needs an Apache version and he doesn’t really know… though he has a vague feeling that the application he builds on top will be less valuable.</p>

<p>We thought we would focus on the cloud offering – <a href="https://terminusdb.com/hub/">TerminusHub</a>, which, as SaaS built on the database, has the benefit of being an in-house ‘product’ that doesn’t worry about the license of the underlying software. However, the community wants to build applications on the software and we want to offer an easy way to build a version control and collaboration layer into ISV applications. We think TerminusDB is the perfect infrastructure to build the next <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. We worry about the syncing, versioning and data collaboration – you worry about your users.</p>

<h3 id="why-shift-licenses">Why shift Licenses</h3>

<p>We do not think that our job is to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We still believe that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">“the fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs.”</a></p>

<p>We would welcome a GPL fork of the TerminusDB code – we are happy to work with any such project should it emerge.</p>

<p>But we wish to build a community first and foremost. In order to facilitate that community, we will be moving to Apache 2.0 immediately.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to focus on creating a great open-source database and allow everybody to use that software in their projects.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>One way or another</strong>, we will all approach the end of life, we are all terminal, and existential anxiety can be a burden long before this. Studies by terror management theory researchers have <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-apply-terror-management-theory-to-improve-human-lives" rel="noopener">found</a> that when death salience is aroused in people, they adapt their behaviour and increase their reliance on defence mechanisms such as denial. The cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker argued in <em>The Denial of Death</em> (1973) that human civilisation is ultimately a symbolic defence mechanism against the awareness of our finite existence. He suggested that â€˜consciousness of death is the primary repression, not sexualityâ€™ as Sigmund Freud had popularised. Unconscious denial of death can have a demoralising effect on an individual, potentially affecting loved ones and the community as a whole.</p>
<p>By not facing the issue of our mortality prior to our passing, we miss a unique opportunity, not only to reconcile with death and make peace with it, but also to gain a sense of levity and serenity that we can carry with us through our lives. But how can we overcome a fear of death thatâ€™s so deeply rooted in our culture?</p>
<p>Research is starting to reveal that certain states of consciousness can have a powerful and positive effect on how we perceive our own mortality. Thereâ€™s a strong association between a decreased fear of death and undergoing a near-death experience (NDE), out-of-body experience (OBE), lucid dream and psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>During an NDE, people report several features such as a transcendence of time and space, a life review, feelings that the experience is ineffable and authentic, encounters with deceased loved ones, and deep feelings of love and peace. One of the core transformative features of the NDE is an out-of-body experience, which is also associated with psychedelic experiences but, unlike these other states, is something that can be induced through training and intent.</p>
<p>One doesnâ€™t even need to have these experiences personally to benefit from them. A number of NDE researchers have noted profound changes in their own outlook following encounters with people who have had an NDE. As noted by one leading researcher, simply hearing or reading about NDEs can have a profound impact, acting as a â€˜benign virusâ€™. Research has <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19349637.2016.1206844" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that this can yield significant changes in peopleâ€™s spirituality and appreciation for both life and death.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist Elaine Drysdale, who works with terminally ill cancer patients in Canada, has heard countless reports of NDEs, and assures patients and their relatives that the experience of death itself isnâ€™t as painful or frightening as it might appear. She now teaches medical students and palliative care staff about the benefits of near-death research, and argues that NDEs allow us to approach the unknown and death without framing things in a religious way â€“ theyâ€™re inclusive, personal and occur in cultures all over the world.</p>
<p>An out-of-body experience can act as a motivating catalyst to further understand yourself</p>
<p>An OBE is a transpersonal experience where you feel your â€˜sense of selfâ€™ shift beyond your physical body, encountering beings and places that feel real. Unlike NDEs, OBEs can be induced willingly. This experience can also occur spontaneously in healthy people while theyâ€™re deeply relaxed, in hypnagogic states, on the cusp of sleep, and during meditation. Almost all OBEs have a positive impact, with experiencers commonly reporting a sense of serenity, mental clarity, awe and interconnectedness.</p>
<p>The experience can act as a motivating catalyst to further understand yourself, and is commonly associated with a reduced fear of death. As the American neuroscientist Sam Harris points out: â€˜whether or not a personâ€™s consciousness can actually be displaced is perhaps irrelevant; the point is it can <em>seem</em> to be.â€™ Distortion of embodiment can be disorientating, but disorientating to <em>whom</em>, if we experience that we arenâ€™t solely the totality of our body? One core feature <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4338/745de83065ca3c853a4d1695d76c1f65374b.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linking</a> these various experiences is the feeling of transcending oneâ€™s primary identification with the physical body. The perspective-shifting power of this effect is supported by experiments <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169343" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">showing</a> that even a simulated OBE induced by immersive virtual reality can lessen death anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>The experience of transcending</strong> the physical body is frequently tied to feelings of connecting to something larger than oneself. This is usually associated with the experience of awe, an emotional state commonly linked to NDEs, OBEs and psychedelic experiences. Itâ€™s also experienced by astronauts when viewing the Earth from space, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/psychedelics-can-have-the-same-overview-effect-as-a-space-journey" rel="noopener">referred</a> to as the â€˜overview effectâ€™. It conjures a cognitive shift of perceptual vastness, reframing oneâ€™s reality and place within it. This draws parallels with OBEs and NDEs, which appear to evoke a kind of â€˜outerview effectâ€™ when people glance back at their body and feel separate from it. This change of core identification from a limited body to a more expansive sense of self can radically curb existential anxiety.</p>
<p>These altered traits could be <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/religion-has-no-monopoly-on-transcendent-experience" rel="noopener">related</a> to ego-dissolution, which is another important experiential component of transcendent experiences. Such experiences are reliably catalysed by psychedelics and characterised by a loss of subjective self-identity; in essence, a simulated dying or death and rebirth experience. Following its dissolution, thereâ€™s a blurring of the perceived boundaries between self and other. Deep feelings of unity, awe and interconnection can stem from this. This experience is strongly associated with the mystical-type experiences that psychedelics can elicit and appears to be an important part of how psychedelics can alleviate death anxiety. Psychedelic therapy might also invoke a sense of ritual â€“ something that has largely been lost to Western culture, but is an important part of many Indigenous cultures, including those that employ psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin, shamanically.</p>
<p>â€˜If it helps them to die peacefully with their friends and family at their side, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s real or an illusionâ€™</p>
<p>The evidence of the efficacy for psilocybin in treating existential angst is arguably the strongest of any yet obtained in the field of psychedelic research, following clinical studies conducted by the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20819978/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">University of California, Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Johns Hopkins University</a> in Baltimore and New York University (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367551/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">NYU</a>) exploring psilocybin as a treatment for existential anxiety in terminally ill cancer patients. Follow-up <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31916890/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> by NYU found sustained reductions in death anxiety <span>4.5 years</span> after a single psilocybin session in the overwhelming majority of study participants. Psilocybin can also <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-011-2358-5" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">catalyse</a> feelings of death transcendence in those who arenâ€™t facing a terminal diagnosis. This is an unprecedented finding in the field of psychiatry.</p>
<p>In the words of Anthony <span>P Bossis,</span> a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the NYU School of Medicine and the former director of palliative care research for the NYU trial:</p>
<blockquote>While there have been advances in chemotherapies and pain management, there remains a paucity of therapies to address and relieve the emotional anguish experienced by the dying. The psychedelic therapy model represents a potential paradigm shift for the future of hospice and palliative care, providing a novel and effective therapy to relieve the emotional and spiritual distress so often experienced at the end of life. Not only can it offer emotional and spiritual healing for those facing their mortality, but it can also help their families who witness the relief of suffering in their loved one.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Another substance that reliably</strong> yields ego-dissolving transcendental experiences and might hold promise is ketamine. Numerous <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381001830535X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">studies</a> have found that the experiences it elicits are closest to the NDE, in phenomenological quality, of all substances examined. On the matter of authenticity of psychedelic insights, the veteran American psychedelic pharmacologist David Nichols had this to say: â€˜If it gives them peace, if it helps them to die peacefully with their friends and family at their side, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s real or an illusion.â€™</p>
<p>The psychiatrist Stanislav Grof has likely supervised more psychedelic therapy sessions than anyone else alive. He treated terminally ill cancer patients with psychedelic therapy as part of his work with the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. He observed patients describing these sessions as invaluable experiential training for dying, with some reporting NDEs as their disease progressed, which they described as yielding very similar states of consciousness. Grof commented that:</p>
<blockquote>â€˜dying before dyingâ€™ influences deeply the quality of life and the basic strategy of existence. It reduces irrational drives â€¦ and increases the ability to live in the present and to enjoy simple life activities. Another important consequence â€¦ is a radical opening to spirituality of a universal and non-denominational type.</blockquote>
<p>One thing reported in association with NDEs, OBEs, lucid dreams (dreams in which the dreamer is aware that theyâ€™re dreaming) and psychedelics (such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-019-05446-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">ayahuasca</a>) is encountering deceased loved ones. Whether or not one takes the view such experiences are illusionary or â€˜realâ€™ in some sense doesnâ€™t take away from the therapeutic power of these encounters. The Holocaust survivor, financier and philanthropist George Sarlo had a life-changing <a href="https://www.jweekly.com/2020/07/16/psychedelic-journeys-brought-peace-to-this-holocaust-survivor-now-hes-helping-others-on-their-own-journeys/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">encounter</a> with ayahuasca in his 70s, during which he had a conversation with his dead father who told him why he hadnâ€™t said goodbye before he was deported to a Nazi labour camp. In turn, feelings of depression that Sarlo had harboured for much of his life evaporated. Others report the resolution of relationship conflicts, feelings of relief, and a sense of closure after encountering a deceased relative. However, these extraordinary experiences arenâ€™t new, as Tibetan Buddhists have been wilfully inducing both OBEs and lucid …</p></div></div></div>

</code></pre></div><p>Even if you write <code>console.log</code> many times a day, you probably haven’t stopped to think about how the words ‘console’ and ‘log’ ended up in a programming language. Isn’t ‘console’ something you do when someone is upset? Isn’t a ‘log’ something you put on a fire?</p><p>Let’s take an etymological stroll through history and see what we can find. Our journey will take us from the early days of computing to medieval churches to the high seas, and we’ll learn that the seemingly unrelated definitions of these words have more in common than you might think.</p><h2 id="console">Console</h2><p>This is a JavaScript debugging console. It displays messages that help a programmer understand what’s happening in the code that’s being executed.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/js-console.gif" alt="A screenshot of the JavaScript debugging console in Google Chrome showing various logged messages"><figcaption><p>The JavaScript console in Google Chrome’s developer tools. Messages from <code>console.log</code> (or in the case of the red and yellow messages, <code>console.error</code> and <code>console.warn</code>) appear here</p></figcaption></figure><p>The concept of a debugging console is not unique to JavaScript. It’s a basic software interface common to many programming languages and applications. It provides a way for a program to output low-level textual information and, optionally, receive inputs for controlling the program.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/osx-console.gif" alt="A screenshot of the OSX Console application"><figcaption><p>The OSX Console application</p></figcaption></figure><p>The definition of console as a software feature comes from the early days of computing, when a user interacted with a computer mainframe (which was often very large and possibly located in another room or building) via an array of controls set in a desk.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/ibm7090.jpg" alt="A man in a white shirt pressing a button on a 1960's IBM computer console"><figcaption><p>A meteorologist at the console of the IBM 7090 electronic computer in the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit in 1965.

Over time, consoles evolved to incorporate a command-line interface on a screen, with which the user would enter instructions using a keyboard.</p><p>We can find analogs of the computer console by looking to the world of music. Sound mixing consoles have existed in one form or another since the advent of electrical audio recording and broadcast almost a century ago.</p><p>But the use of the word console to describe a panel of electrical controls can be traced even further back, beyond the discovery of electricity itself, to the pipe organ.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/pipe-organ-ebrach-kirche.jpg" alt="Interior photograph of a church showing the pipe organ facade below a large stained glass window"><figcaption><p>The pipe organ facade in the former abbey church in Ebrach, Germany.

Organ consoles consist of keyboards (typically three to five), pedals, and stops - binary valves used for controlling wind flow to the pipes.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/organ-console.jpg" alt="A pipe organ console with console brackets"><figcaption><p>Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Usnaconsole.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Organ consoles give us another everyday term: the idiom ‘pulling out all the stops’, meaning to apply maximum effort to a task. When every stop on the console is open an organ will produce sound using every available pipe, and therefore at maximum volume.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/cesar-franck.jpg" alt="Painting of composer and organist César Franck pulling out an organ stop"><figcaption><p>Composer César Franck pulling out a stop at the console of the organ at St. Clotilde Basilica, Paris, 1885. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cesar_Franck_At_Organ.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>But where did this type of console get its name? One clue lies in the fact that many organ consoles share a design feature with the console table. Modern console tables are typically four-legged, free-standing structures designed to abut a wall. But if we go back a few centuries, we find that console tables were more commonly wall-mounted with brackets beneath the table surface to bear the load.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/console-table.jpg" alt="Marble and gilt oak console table with decoratively carved supporting brackets"><figcaption><p>French Regency console table from the Metropolitan Museum of Art collection in New York. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Console_table_MET_DP268329.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>These supporting brackets are where the console table, (and perhaps the organ console) gets its name. In architecture, a console refers to an ornamental bracket that supports a protruding structure, such as a ledge, cornice, or balcony.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/console-architecture.jpg" alt="A neoclassical stone console supporting a balcony"><figcaption><p>Neoclassical stone console supporting a balcony at the Maison médicale de l'Œuvre du calvaire in Brussels. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fa%C3%A7adebalconconsolechausseewavreneoclassique.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, our etymological path forks. An architectural console may get its name from the verb ‘to console’: literally <em>con solaris</em> or ‘with soothing’; a relieving of pain or, perhaps, of weight. You could consider the job of a console to ‘relieve’ the weight of the structure above it.</p><p>An alternative explanation takes us back to the church, where in medieval times choir stalls were decorated with carved male figures called <em>consolateurs</em> or ‘consolers’. This in itself may have been a pun on the fact that consolers were often carved into armrests, thus supporting the weight of a seated chorist’s arms.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/choir-stall.jpg" alt="Illustration of wooden choir stalls showing carved consoles in the arm rests"><figcaption><p>Illustration showing the carved wooden <em>consolateurs</em> in the armrests of the choir stalls at Andlau Abbey in Alsace, France. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stalles.eglise.Anellau.png">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>So, far from being coincidental homonyms, it turns out that the many definitions of ‘console’ share a common etymological root, even when it’s used as a verb. Does the same go for ‘log’?</p><h2 id="log">Log</h2><p>In computing, the term ‘log’ derives from a ship’s log, which is short for ‘logbook’. A logbook is used for recording information about any event taking place aboard a vessel, from navigation to maintenance to changes in crew. While there are typically no restrictions about what can be recorded in a logbook, the name comes from a very specific use: recording the ship’s speed.</p><p>Long before the invention of modern instruments, such as GPS, recording speed was an essential part of navigating the seas. Sailors would measure their speed and record it in the logbook every half hour, and by knowing how fast they were going, combined with the direction in which they were traveling (measured using a compass), they could work out where they were on the map.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/ships-logbook.jpg" alt="Ships logbook showing handwritten entries"><figcaption><p>Logbook from the USS Savannah with entries from September 3-15, 1943. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:19430903-19430915_USS_Savannah_CL-42_Turret_Two_log_book_entries.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>The logbook got its name from the chip log, a device that sailors used to measure the ship’s speed. This consisted of a quarter-circle piece of wood (the ‘chip’) with a rope tied to it, in which knots were tied at regular intervals.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/chip-log.jpg" alt="Chip log"><figcaption><p>19th century chip log. Image credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Loch_%C3%A0_plateau.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>A sailor would throw the chip overboard and count how many knots spooled out while another sailor timed him using a sand timer. When the timer was up, the number of knots that had passed over the stern could be used to calculate the ship’s speed, which was then recorded in the logbook. This is where we get the term ‘knot’ as shorthand for 1 nautical mile per hour.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/chip-log-engraving.jpg" alt="An engraving of three mates measuring a ship’s speed using a chip log"></figure><p>Before the invention of the chip log, an even more rudimentary technique for gauging speed was the Dutchman’s log. One sailor would throw any floating object (probably an actual log) over the bow of the ship while another sailor on the stern timed how long it took for the object to pass him. With this measurement (and knowing the length of the ship), the sailors could make a rough estimate of how fast they were travelling.</p><p>The days of using a log to measure a ship’s speed lie centuries behind us, but ‘log’ is a ubiquitous term in modern life thanks to its importance in computing (just think how many times you ‘log in’ to various pieces of software every day). And it’s just one of many modern definitions whose origins lie in our civilization’s long maritime history. We don’t need to look far to find more: the word ‘cyber’ derives from the ancient Greek word <em>kubernētēs</em>, meaning steersman or rudder, and the word ‘gadget’ was a slang term used by sailors for any part of a ship that they couldn’t remember the correct name of.</p><p>So next time you write <code>console.log</code> in your editor, spare a thought for the computer pioneers, pipe organists, medieval carvers, and old-word mariners who played a small part in giving us the very modern definitions of these two words.</p><hr><p><em>If you enjoyed this, you may want to read <a href="https://jshakespeare.com/your-creations-will-not-outlast-you/">Your creations will not outlast you</a>.</em></p></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s important to understand the uses and abuses of streaming infrastructure.</p>
<p>Apache Kafka is a message broker that has rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years. Message brokers have been around for a long time; they’re a type of datastore specialized for “buffering” messages between producer and consumer systems. Kafka has become popular because it’s open-source and capable of scaling to very large numbers of messages.</p>
<p>Message brokers are classically used to decouple producers and consumers of data. For example, at Fivetran, we use a message broker similar to Kafka to buffer customer-generated webhooks before loading them in batches into your data warehouse:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" alt="A Message Broker Used as a buffer before loading into a data warehouse" width="960" height="124" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w"></p>
<p>In this scenario, the message broker is providing durable storage of events between when a customer sends them, and when Fivetran loads them into the data warehouse.</p>
<p>However, Kafka has occasionally been described as something much more than just a better message broker. Proponents of this viewpoint position Kafka as a fundamentally new way of managing data, where <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka replaces the relational database as the definitive record of what has happened</a>. Instead of reading and writing a traditional database, you append events to Kafka, and read from downstream views that represent the present state. This architecture has been described as “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning the database inside out</a>“.</p>
<p>In principle, it is possible to implement this architecture in a way that supports both reads and writes. However, during that process you will eventually confront every hard problem that database management systems have faced for decades. You will more or less have to write a full-fledged DBMS in your application code. And you will probably not do a great job, because databases take years to get right. You will have to deal with dirty reads, phantom reads, write skew, and all the other symptoms of a hastily implemented database.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with using Kafka as your primary data store is it provides no isolation. Isolation means that, globally, all transactions (reads and writes) occur along some consistent history. Jepsen provides a <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">guide</a> of isolation levels (inhabiting an isolation level means that the system will never encounter certain anomalies).</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example of why isolation is important: suppose we’re running an online store. When a user checks out, we want to make sure all their items are actually in stock. The way to do this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the inventory level for each item in the user’s cart.</li>
<li>If an item is no longer available, abort the checkout.</li>
<li>If all items are available, subtract them from the inventory and confirm the checkout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we are using Kafka to manage this process. Our architecture might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" alt="A microservice workflow for processing checkouts" width="960" height="753" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w"></p>
<p>The web server reads the inventory level from a view downstream from Kafka, but it can only commit the transaction <em>upstream</em> in the checkouts topic. The problem is one of <strong>concurrency control</strong>: if there are two users racing to buy the last item, <em>only one must succeed</em>. We need to read the inventory view and confirm the checkout at <em>a single point in time</em>. However, there is no way to do this in this architecture.</p>
<p>The problem we now have is called <a href="http://justinjaffray.com/what-does-write-skew-look-like/">write skew</a>. Our reads from the inventory view can be out of date by the time the checkout event is processed. If two users try to buy the same item at nearly the same time, they will both succeed, and we won’t have enough inventory for them both.</p>
<p>Event-sourced architectures like these suffer many such isolation anomalies, which constantly gaslight users with “time travel” behavior that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unread+notification+glitch">we’re all familiar with</a>. Even worse, research shows that anomaly-permitting architectures create outright security holes that allow hackers to steal data, as covered in <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/acid-rain/">this excellent blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/acidrain-sigmod2017.pdf">this research paper.</a></p>

<p>These problems can be avoided if you use Kafka as a <em>complement</em> to a traditional database:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" alt="kafka used for Change Data Capture from an OLTP database" width="960" height="658" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w"></p>
<p>OLTP databases perform a crucial task that message brokers are not well suited to provide: admission control of events. Rather than using a message broker as a receptacle for “fire and forget” events, forcing your event schema into an “intent pattern”, an OLTP database can <em>deny</em> events that conflict, ensuring that only a single consistent stream of events are ever emitted. OLTP databases are really good at this core <strong>concurrency control</strong> task – scaling to many millions of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Using a database as the point-of-entry for writes, the best way to extract events from a database is via streaming <strong>change-data-capture</strong>. There are several great open CDC frameworks like <a href="http://debezium.io/">Debezium</a> and <a href="http://maxwells-daemon.io/">Maxwell</a>, as well as native CDC from <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/change-data-capture.html">modern</a> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28313/cdc.htm">SQL</a> <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/architecture/docdb-replication/change-data-capture/">databases</a>. Change-data-capture also sets up an elegant operational story. In recovery scenarios, everything can be purged downstream and rebuilt from the (very durable) OLTP database.</p>

<p>The database community has learned (and re-learned) several important lessons over decades. Each one of these lessons was obtained at the high prices of data corruption, data loss, and numerous user-facing anomalies. The last thing you want to do is to find yourself relearning these lessons because you <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491944608/video244677.html">accidentally misbuilt a database</a>.</p>
<p>Real-time streaming message brokers are a great tool for managing high-velocity data. But you will still need a traditional DBMS for isolating transactions. The best reference architecture for “turning your database inside out” is to use OLTP databases for admission control, use CDC for event generation, and model downstream copies of the data as materialized views.</p>

    <h2>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Ard<br>}</h2><br>
  <h2>Little Tasks, Little Trust</h2>
  <h3>How Delegating Responsibilities is Better Than Managing By Tasks</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Trust is the highest form of motivation. It brings out the very
    best in people.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    --Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It’s basically a sacred project management mantra by
now: <strong>divide your work into tasks that are as small as
possible</strong>. Estimate them with your team. Then drop them into
the all-knowing product backlog. But no one seems to be looking very
critically at how this practice has affected the software engineering
profession. Back in the 90’s, when I started programming, this was not
how it worked. It was, dare I say, a little more
professional.</p><p>Back then, your boss had a dozen or more things
they were responsible for and when you got hired they breathed a deep
sigh of relief.</p><p>“Finally, now that Vincent is here, I can make
him do A and B; and with Ted doing C, D, and E and Jan doing F, G, and
H, I can finally get to I, J, K, L, and M.”</p><p>Most importantly, A
and B were big things, like whole products or large system
libraries. Building and maintaining them consumed all of your
time. They were your delegated responsibilities, not mere tasks. It
wasn’t that hard to manage people this way either. If you weren’t
doing a good job, the boss would let you know.</p><p>“Hey, Vincent, A
isn’t turning out quite like I was imagining. Can you do a little more
of this — and definitely more cowbell.”</p><p>Then you went back to
your private office (I sure miss private offices, but that is a topic
for another day) and fixed a few things. Later, in a weekly status
meeting you would tell people how it went — yep, that’s right, no
daily stand-ups where you look mournfully at your shoes and admit that
you didn’t make any notable progress yet.</p><p>No backlog grooming
meetings or burn-down charts either. Your manager simply looked at
how <em>your </em>products were coming along. A little trust, some
accountability, and a healthy portion of “give me some space to do my
work.”</p><p>The way we work now is different. Sadly, it’s less
motivating, less efficient, and profoundly less respectful of
individual abilities.</p><h3>whose vision is it again?</h3><p>As I
see it, little tasks are born of a fundamentally different management
attitude. Small tasks are a not-so-subtle way of saying that all the
product vision lies with management. Keep away. Don’t
touch.</p><p>While larger tasks send a completely different
message. Here, management is giving you bigger pieces to chew on,
inviting you to mix some of your own creativity with the end
product. You get to do some design work, think about what the customer
needs, and take pride in what comes out the other end. Sure, the
organization has an overarching strategy, but they still want people
to take on responsibilities, not just errands. They trust you to align
with the overall vision and because you feel like you are part of the
“club”, you actually want to.</p><h3>too much love for the
metrics</h3><p>Small tasks have also taken hold because they fit
nicely with the age-old assembly-line mentality. Sadly, there are
armies of managers that still live by that dogma. For them, it is all
about picking <em>metrics and optimizing them </em>— management by
chart and graph.</p><p>Unfortunately, little tasks in Jira (or any of
the dozens of other issue tracking systems out there) bring the
promise of a whole host of tasty new charts and graphs: burn-down,
burn-up, velocity, lead-time, cycle time, task age, throughput, failed
deployment, flow and control. It’s as irresistible as candy to a
baby.</p><p>But, assigning responsibilities instead of tasks takes
away an assembly-line manager’s favorite tools. Because they are
larger, responsibilities can’t be so easily measured and tracked. So
metrics-managers will fight both tooth and nail to keep your work divided
and cataloged in tiny, traceable instructions.</p><h3>when will I get some design
experience?</h3><p>Sadly, as developers, we do it to ourselves as
well. Once someone gives us a better title, we are right on board with
the program. When a regular developer might have had a chance to do
some research or design, we immediately snatch it away for
ourselves.</p><p>As technical management, we standardize our
frameworks, languages, deployment operating systems, and cloud service
providers. We write wrappers around networking, logging, and
monitoring libraries and demand they always be used. Then, after we
have taken the task of designing and researching the CI/CD tools and
pipeline, we write coding standards for our coding
standards.</p><p>Worse yet, we design every product’s architecture,
and expect any deviation to be approved by us first. All that is left
are tiny morsels. Grunt work for the foot soldiers once the fun has
been stripped away.</p><p>Poor front-line programmers are left
wide-eyed with empty bowls, asking “please sir, can I have some more?
I just wanted to design one little service. I know I am not worthy,
but can I please just write my own sql queries without using that
awful ORM?  PLEASE?”</p><p>Sadly, when those poor programmers finally
seek promotion, hoping for their first real shot at higher level
engagement, they are rebuffed: “You don’t really have any design
experience I am afraid. We are looking for someone who has designed
large systems.”</p><p>To their managers they could rightfully reply,
“that was your doing, not mine!”</p><h3>estimation is never
free</h3><p>There is a grave misconception circulating that if you
just sit down, in a comfy conference room chair, and split a project
into tiny tasks, small enough to be individually estimated,
then when you add them up, Viola! You’ll have a accurate
estimate for the whole project! Easy peasy.</p><p>There are two
problems with this delusion. First, no task, even a small one,
is easy to estimate. I have seen many “tiny”, one-day tasks blow up
into week long campaigns. All because of hidden complexity that comes
popping out like a Pandora’s box once you start coding on
it.</p><p>Second, when you divide work into little tasks, before
actually working on any of them, you are making untested
assumptions. Many of them. The more tasks you define, the more facets
of a hypothetical design you must assume (implicitly of course, since
no one ever writes design assumptions in task descriptions). Soon,
you’ve created a long chain of design choices, all depending on
previous ones, sitting on sticky notes on the wall.</p><p>The problem
is, as soon as you start working on one of them, you will
realize that your implicit design decisions are wrong. Now, you will spend MUCH more time than was
previously estimated for this task and all other tasks that depend on
its faulty design are invalid. The whole house of cards comes
tumbling down. Time for another all-day backlog grooming session? What
a waste!</p><h3>conclusion</h3><p>Back in the day, before everyone
realized that software companies were positioned to make lots of
money, we had some elbow room. We had a lot of responsibility and the
ability to make a lot of decisions. But now, a lot more people have
piled onto the island. Unfortunately, some of them have slowly chipped
away at the domain of the software engineer. One by one, descending
from their vessels they planted their flags:</p><p>“I am Amerigo, the
product guy. Heretofore, no developer will make product decisions, for
they are mine.”</p><p>“And I am Ferdinand, process guy. Heretofore,
no developer will make process decisions, for they are
mine.”</p><p>“I Bartolomeu will enforce compliance.”</p><p>“I Vasco
used to be pretty good at Microsoft Access, I guess I’ll be the
database guy.”</p><p>One by one, until every responsibility that
wasn’t actual open-up-emacs-and-start-typing-stuff programming was
taken away, forbidden even. And then, the remaining, purely technical
tasks were carved up by architecture/standard hoarding engineers,
hungry for something of substance. Only dry, broken carcasses were
left scattered on the ground.</p><p>Of course, there is a solution to
this predicament — delegate <em>responsibilities</em> to everyone,
all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy. Or better yet,
flatten or abolish the hierarchy all together. But until that
happens, you’ll just have to content yourself with measly for-loops
and if-statements — following the coding standard of
course.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>F</span>eel-good moments are difficult to come by on Twitter in Pakistan. In between the political infighting and trolls, though, there was a brief moment where the ugliness the platform often brings out in people gave way to the app’s potential for humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, a Karachi school teacher, Aimun Faisal, tweeted questions from her students about space and space travel. “Do you get scared that your space shuttle might get lost?” one 10-year-old asked. Ms. Faisal tagged NASA and other space agencies in the post, encouraging readers to retweet it and bring it to their attention. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/nasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">It worked</a>.</p>



<p>A Canadian astronaut who has flown in a space shuttle twice replied that he wasn’t scared because Earth was nearby, and he could use the stars to find his way. “I felt especially comforted when I flew over home,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/1316390465277767682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1316390465277767682%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgulfnews.com%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fpakistan%2Fnasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">he tweeted</a>. “Here’s a photo I took of Karachi — can you find your school?”</p>



<p>It’s the kind of interaction that leads one to believe that perhaps all you need in life is a Twitter account and a heart that still beats. The media ate it up too: Ms. Faisal and her tweet were in all the major newspapers and even on TV. We were gushy over Ms. Faisal; we wished there were more teachers like her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, people were suggesting that Ms. Faisal should go jump into a river or move to another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It all turned after — what else? — a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One evening this past September, a woman set out in her car on a motorway outside Lahore, her two children in tow. Motorways in Pakistan are safer than most roads there; they have their own police, who have a reputation, unlike other police units, for being well-dressed and resistant to corruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That evening, the woman’s car ran out of fuel. She locked her car doors and made some phone calls, but the rescue service didn’t answer, and she couldn’t get through to her family. By now, it was past midnight. She made more calls and waited for a friend to come pick her up. While she waited, two men emerged from the darkness, broke her car window, and when she fought back, took her children into some nearby bushes. She scrambled to save them, and while she fought, she was gang-raped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the pre–social media age, if a rape story ever got more than a couple of column inches on the inside pages of a newspaper, the victim not only had asked for it but, by reporting it and making it public, was asking for something more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with the <em>Washington Post</em>, Pakistan’s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf (now absconded from the country) once said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/09/19/musharraf-denies-rape-comments/5f2e0d4c-5ff2-4273-81e5-878cd59a1744/">Pakistani women get themselves raped so they can get a Canadian visa</a>. He probably thought he was being funny or insightful. When his office denied his having said it, the <em>Post</em> made the audio public. You can hear one of his aides laughing in the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attitudes toward rape haven’t changed much since the Musharraf days, but there was something about the awfulness of a woman trapped with her children on a motorway at night that struck a chord with the Pakistani public. As the news rippled through Twitter, #LahoreMotorwayIncident became a trending hashtag. The details of the crime were so grotesque that, for a few days, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54186609">seemed the nation actually believed that rape was a crime</a> and that the woman hadn’t asked for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan’s traditional and social media go into this kind of outrage cycle when children get raped, or get raped and then killed, which happens more often than one can stomach. There was genuine fury across the country when a 7-year-old girl was raped, strangled, and left in a rubbish heap two years ago. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1439587">Her name was Zainab</a>. On Twitter and Facebook, users argued over whether her rapist and killer should be hanged in public, quartered, doused in acid, or just locked up for life.</p>



<p>After the motorway incident, the usual bloodlust was on display. There were calls for public hangings and for chopping up the culprits. Prime Minister Imran Khan even appeared on a TV interview saying <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/asia/imran-khan-chemical-castration-rapists-intl/index.html">he has been contemplating chemical castration as a punishment for such crimes</a>.</p>

<p>And while the Lahore rapists were still on the loose, the newly appointed Lahore police chief appeared on one of the nightly news shows during the wall-to-wall media coverage. In effect, he said he was surprised that a mother of two had decided to take the motorway when another road would have sufficed for her journey. And if she had to take the motorway, he went on to ask, couldn’t she at least have checked her gas tank?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, the teacher we had fawned over just weeks prior for her tweets about space travel, was outraged. On Twitter, she was one of many to demand the police chief’s resignation, tweeting in disgust at the craven responses to the news she and others were seeing, rhetorical questions as to why the woman had failed to prevent her own assault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In return, our beloved Ms. Faisal was met with a flood of insults; trolls suggested she leave Pakistan if she had a problem with it. Being stuck on the motorway without gas became an internet meme that small-time politicians and social media trolls lobbed at one another. Somewhere along the way, “Why didn’t she check her petrol tank before leaving her home?” replaced the original question: “What kind of beasts would rape a woman in front of her children?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did this horror morph into a meme? Does every one of us carry inside us a bit of General Musharraf, smirking while his aides giggle?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long before we had social media, Pakistan swam through its sea of miseries on the backs of jokes. The mausoleum of Pakistan’s longest-serving dictator, General Zia’ul Haq, is jokingly referred to as Jaws Square. Guess why? Because, after ruling over us for 11 years, he died in a plane crash, and only his teeth survived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jokes back then went viral before we ever began to call them “viral.” You would hear one about the dictator in Urdu in Karachi one day, and the next day in Peshawar, someone would tell you it in Pashto. Jokes eased us out of our terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now the jokes themselves have become the terror. You can make a joke about a dead dictator, or Osama bin Laden becoming fish food, but how do you laugh at a joke about a woman raped in front of her children on the side of the motorway in the dead of night? Jokes were meant to subvert the powerful, not kick the poor to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a brief moment, social media in Pakistan made it easy to laugh at despots and oppressors. They answered with troll farms, indoctrinating the youth to be subservient to power. Even in the midst of incidents so nauseating that they capture the attention of our fractured social media, the horrors of which seem undeniable, the trolls find ways to mock and belittle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, another shocking piece of news roiled Pakistan’s social media: A 4-year-old rape survivor told her gut-wrenching story in a video that went viral. It was so harrowing, I couldn’t bring myself to watch it, even for reporting purposes. In another video, also shared widely online, the doctor who treated her after the assault broke down crying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Twitter, it’s easy to find redemption in the narrative too. In the middle of the outrage cycle, social media made a hero of the policeman <a href="https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/11/14/pakistani-policeman-uses-own-daughter-as-bait-to-nab-rapists">who had found the girl’s rapist by enlisting his own daughter to lure him</a>. The rapist was killed in a police encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policeman and his underage daughter were forced to take this extreme step because there were no women officers in his district. The prime minister called to congratulate the man, and his daughter was awarded a million rupees as a prize along with a guaranteed college scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, who by now has endured a litany of abuses online, questioned the collective satisfaction on social media. As proud as we are of the police officer, she tweeted, the story said more about the country’s broken system than it did about heroism. “No police officer should be forced to risk his family to perform his duty,”<a href="https://twitter.com/bluemagicboxes/status/1327209635594588165"> she wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“Tum kabhi khush na hona,” someone tweeted back. “You’ll never be happy.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Johnny Galbraith, co-founder of Salt Lake City-based e-commerce company Letterfolk, knew that it was going to be difficult to get orders to customers in a timely manner this holiday season, with more people ordering online than ever before.</p><p>He thought he had come up with a solution: to hold his Black Friday sale a week earlier this year. That way, he would be shipping out his products before carriers like FedEx — which he estimates ships 75% of Letterfolk’s packages — would be under the most strain.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>But on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, Galbraith got a call from his FedEx representative: through the holidays, FedEx would only pick up 110 Letterfolk packages per day — something that has never happened to Galbraith in the five years he’s been in business. It was a number that was calculated based on the average number of packages FedEx was picking up from Letterfolk per day in September, plus 10%. But thanks to his early Black Friday sale, Galbraith had a queue of 3,000 orders waiting to go out.</p>

<p>“It was like, ‘this is going to ruin us as a business,'” said Galbraith, whose company sells letterboards and other home decor. “We are being told that just to ship out our existing queue — without any other orders coming it — it would take us up until the holidays to get them out to customers.”</p>
<p>Carriers like FedEx and UPS have been warning for months to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-holiday-crunch-starts-early-with-more-packages-than-means-to-deliver-them-11603013401">expect holiday shipping delays</a>. But some retail executives, like Galbraith, say they were not given advanced notice by carriers that they could face package pickup limits this holiday. It’s an issue that’s affecting companies both big and small — the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-slaps-shipping-limits-on-gap-nike-to-manage-e-commerce-surge-11606926669">reported</a> last week that UPS had temporarily stopped accepting shipments from major retailers like Nike and Macy’s.</p>
<p>Some executives who spoke with Modern Retail said that they feel like their carriers did not give them enough advance notice before applying a limit, and are frustrated by the fact that limits seem to be arbitrarily applied. In the meantime, they’re scrambling to find often expensive alternatives, including renting their own trucks or trying to find space with other carriers.</p>
<p>Representatives from FedEx and UPS would not provide details to Modern Retail about how they calculate package pickup limits.</p>
<p>FedEx has been “proactively working with our customers to understand their expected volume,” a spokeswoman told Modern Retail, and said the company has been preparing for the holidays by hiring more than 70,000 seasonal workers this year, and for the first time, picking up packages seven days a week.</p>

<p>“<span>UPS</span>&nbsp;continues to work closely with our largest customers to steer volume to capacity and ensure the&nbsp;<span>UPS</span> network is reliable for all customers,” a UPS spokesman said. “Agreed upon strategies for our largest customers include shifting package volume away from the heaviest demand shipping days, fully utilizing weekend capacity, and aligning promotional strategies with capacity.”</p>
<p><strong>Making their own deliveries<br>
</strong>For the most part, UPS and FedEx first started imposing shipping limits after Black Friday. Helena Price Hambrecht, founder of aperitif brand Haus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/business/ecommerce-shipping-holiday-season.html?referringSource=articleShare">told the New York Times</a> that FedEx informed her that starting on Wednesday, its drivers would only pick up 500 packages from Haus per week day, through the holidays. FedEx however, did give Haus a larger cap on the weekends. In a follow-up email to Modern Retail, Price Hambrecht did not say exactly when FedEx informed her of the limit, only that “FedEx has been great about communicating changes to us as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>David Malka, chief sales officer of returns processing company goTRG — which works with major retailers like Target, Walmart and Lowe’s to process some of their returns — told Modern Retail that shipping limits of roughly 200 packages per day had been imposed at four of the company’s warehouses. Though he added that the company is getting “conflicting reports” from FedEx about what exactly the limit is at some facilities. Malka, like Gilbraith said that goTRG received no advanced notice from FedEx that package pickup limits would be applied.</p>
<p>The most immediate way that retailers are trying to deal with pickup limits imposed by UPS or FedEx is to redirect some shipments to another carrier. Shortly after Galbraith’s FedEx representative informed him of Letterfolk’s new limit, he immediately set up deliveries through UPS — something he said he hadn’t done previously because he had a good relationship with FedEx.</p>
<p>That’s helped Letterfolk get through some of the 3,000 order backlog, though its <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/pages/holiday-shipping-info">website is still advising customer</a>s that most orders placed during its Black Friday sale will ship within one to three business weeks. However, he said that it’s more expensive right now for Letterfolk to ship through UPS, because his company didn’t have time to negotiate discounted rates.</p>
<p>Some companies are setting up other contingency plans to ensure their packages get into customers hands more quickly. Price Hambrecht told Modern Retail that Haus will be relying on Ohi, a last-mile delivery provider, to deliver more of its packages in the Bay Area and Southern California.</p>
<p>Jay Sauceda, founder of Austin-based 3PL Sauceda Industries, said that his company rented its own truck for the first time for the holidays. Sauceda — which works with companies including apparel brand Rowing Blazers and bra startup Pepper — has yet to be hit with a package pickup per day limit. But if it does, the plan then is to load packages onto the truck and deliver them directly to a FedEx or UPS sorting facility.</p>
<p>Sauceda is also advising its customers to try and encourage customers to get orders in two to three days ahead of shipping cutoffs given by FedEx, UPS and other carriers to ensure packages arrive in time for Christmas and other key dates.</p>
<p>“[The carriers] are in a very unenviable position,” Sauceda said. “So the biggest thing that we are trying to do this year to try to take the tension off.”</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that FedEx has capped the number of Haus packages it will pick up at 500 per week day, not per day as previously stated.&nbsp;</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Observability pipelines have become critical infrastructure in the current technological landscape, which is why we've built <a href="https://vector.dev/">Vector</a> to provide extremely high throughput with the tiniest resource footprint we can manage (<a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a huge help here). But this is not enough in the real world: your observability pipeline needs to provide optimal performance and efficiency while <em>also</em> being a good infrastructure citizen and playing nicely with services like <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> and <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/clickhouse">Clickhouse</a>.</p><p>And so we're excited to announce that Vector version 0.11 includes support for <strong>Adaptive Request Concurrency</strong> (ARC) in all of its HTTP-based <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks">sinks</a>. This feature does away with static rate limits and automatically optimizes HTTP concurrency limits based on downstream service responses. The underlying <a href="#how-it-works">mechanism</a> is a feedback loop inspired by TCP congestion control algorithms.</p><h2>The lead-up</h2><p>One of the most common support questions we get about Vector involves logs like this:</p><div><div><pre><div><p><span>TRACE tower_limit::rate::service: rate limit exceeded, disabling service</span></p></div></pre></div></div><p>Users typically have two questions about this:</p><ol><li>What does it mean?</li><li>How can I fix it?</li></ol><p>The answer to the first question is simple: Vector has <em>internally</em> rate-limited processing to respect user-configured limits—<a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate_limit_duration_secs"><code>request.rate_limit_duration_secs</code></a>, <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate_limit_num"><code>request.rate_limit_num</code></a>, and <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#in_flight_limit"><code>request.in_flight_limit</code></a>—for that particular <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks">sink</a>. In other words, Vector has intentionally reduced performance to stay within static limits.</p><p>The answer to the second question—how to fix it—is more complex because it depends on a variety of factors that change over time (covered in more detail <a href="#the-second-problem-rate-limiting-is-not-a-panacea">below</a>). Telling the user to raise their limits would be irresponsible since we'd then risk overwhelming the downstream service and causing an outage; but not changing them could mean limiting performance in a dramatic way.</p><blockquote><p>"In one case, we found that rate limits were limiting performance by over 80%."</p></blockquote><p>The crux of the matter is that Vector's high throughput presents a major challenge for HTTP-based sinks like <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> because those services can't always handle event payloads as quickly as Vector can send them. And when data services are heavily interdependent—which is almost always!—letting Vector overhwelm one of them can lead to system-wide performance degradation or even cascading failures.</p><p>In versions of Vector prior to 0.11, you could address this problem by setting <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate-limits"><strong>rate limits</strong></a> on outbound HTTP traffic to downstream services. Rate limiting certainly <em>does</em> help prevent certain worst-case scenarios but customer feedback and our own internal QA has revealed that this approach also has deep limitations.</p><h2>The problem: rate limiting is not a panacea</h2><p>Rate limiting is nice to have as a fallback but it's a blunt instrument, a static half-solution to a dynamic problem. The core problem is that configuring your own rate limits locks you into a perpetual loop:</p><p><img src="https://vector.dev/img/rate-limiting-loop.png" alt="The rate limiting decision loop"></p><p>Within this vicious loop, you need to constantly avoid two outcomes:</p><ul><li>You set the limit too high and thus <strong>compromise system reliability</strong> by overwhelming your services. Time to lower the limit and re-assess.</li><li>You set the limit too low and <strong>waste resources</strong>. Your Elasticsearch cluster may be capable of handling more concurrency than you're providing—at least for now. Time to raise the limit and re-assess.</li></ul><p>Not only do you need to perform this balancing act on a per-sink basis and on each Vector instance—that may be a <em>lot</em> of application points in your system—but the optimal rate is an elusive target that shifts along with changes in a number of factors:</p><ul><li>The number of Vector instances currently sending traffic</li><li>The current capacity of downstream services</li><li>The volume of data you're currently sending</li></ul><p>These changes are especially pronounced in highly elastic environments, like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, that are essentially <em>designed</em> to let you tweak cluster topologies, configuration, and much more with very little friction, which compounds the problem.</p><p>And don't forget, of course, that this chasing-the-dragon decision loop has its own cognitive and operational costs.</p><h2>The solution: Adaptive Request Concurrency</h2><p>We feel strongly that Vector's <strong>Adaptive Request Concurrency</strong> (ARC) feature provides a qualitatively better path than rate limiting. With ARC <a href="#the-role-of-configuration">enabled</a> on any given sink, Vector determines the optimal network concurrency based on current environment conditions and continuously re-adjusts in light of new information.</p><p>Here's how that plays out in some example scenarios:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Change</th><th></th><th>Response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><em>You deploy more Vector instances</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector automatically redistributes HTTP throughput across both current and new instances</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>You scale up your Elasticsearch cluster</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector automatically increases concurrency to take full advantage of the new capacity</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>You scale your Elasticsearch cluster back down</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector lowers concurrency to avoid any risk of destabilizing the cluster (while still taking full of advantage of the now-decreased bandwidth)</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Your Elasticsearch cluster experiences a temporary outage</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector lowers concurrency dramatically and provides backpressure by <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#buffer">buffering</a> events</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With ARC, these scenarios require no human intervention. Vector quietly hums along making these decisions for you with a speed and granularity that rate limits simply cannot provide.</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>ARC in Vector is based on a decision-making process that’s fairly simple at a high level. When Vector POSTs data to downstream services via HTTP, it continuously keeps track of downstream service performance and uses that information to make precise concurrency decisions.</p><p>The diagram below shows Vector's decision chart:</p><p><img src="https://vector.dev/img/adaptive-concurrency.png" alt="The Adaptive Request Concurrency decision chart"></p><p>With ARC enabled, Vector watches for significant movements in two things: the round-trip time (RTT) of requests and HTTP response codes (failure vs. success).</p><ul><li>If the RTT is declining/constant and/or response codes are consistently successful (200-299), Vector sees 🟢 and increases the throughput linearly. This is the "additive increase" in AIMD.</li><li>If the RTT is increasing and/or response codes consistently indicate failure—codes like <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> and <code>503 Service Unavailable</code>—Vector sees 🟡 and exponentially decreases concurrency. This is the "multiplicative decrease" in AIMD.</li></ul><p>This decision tree is always active and Vector always "knows" what to do, even in extreme cases like total service failure.</p><h3>The role of configuration</h3><p>Vector never stops quietly making the linear up vs. exponential down decision in the background, and it works out of the box with zero configuration beyond enabling the feature, which is currently on an opt-in basis in version 0.11. You can enable ARC in an HTTP sink by setting the <a href="https://vector.dev/blog/adaptive-request-concurrency/request_concurrency"><code>request.concurrency</code></a> parameter to <code>adaptive</code>. Here's an example for a Clickhouse sink:</p><div><div><pre><div><p><span>[</span><span>sinks.clickhouse_internal</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"clickhouse"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>inputs</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"log_stream_1"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"log_stream_2"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>host</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"http://clickhouse-prod:8123"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"prod-log-data"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>request.concurrency</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"adaptive"</span></p></div></pre></div></div><p>There's also room for fine-tuning if you find yourself needing additional knobs:</p><ul><li><strong>Buffering</strong>. What happens when Vector needs to lower concurrency and thus throttle the output? What happens to data that needs to be sent later? Vector lets you choose between an on-disk and an in-memory <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#buffer">buffer</a> and to set a <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#max_size">max_size</a> for that buffer. The <code>memory</code> buffer is the default, which maximizes performance, but you can always choose <code>disk</code> if your use case requires stronger durability guarantees. As always, this can be configured on a per-sink basis.</li><li><strong>The adaptive concurrency algorithm itself</strong>. In general, you shouldn't need to adjust the algorithm, but in case you need to resort to that, there are three parameters available:<ul><li><code>decrease_ratio</code> — This determines how rapidly Vector lowers the limit in response to failures or higher latency.</li><li><code>ewma_alpha</code> — Vector uses an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past RTT measurements as a reference to compare with the current RTT. The <code>ewma_alpha</code> parameter determines how heavily new measurements are weighted compared to older ones.</li><li><code>rtt_threshold_ratio</code> — The minimal change in RTT necessary for the algorithm to respond and adjust concurrency; changes below that threshold are ignored.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The defaults should work just fine for these parameters in most cases, but we know that some scenarios may call for a highly targeted approach.</p><h2>How we built it</h2><p>The development process behind ARC was highly methodical and data-driven. To summarize:</p><ul><li>Customer feedback has pinpointed concurrency management as a pain point since very early in the life of Vector.</li><li>The initial foray in addressing the problem came in <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/rfcs/2020-04-06-1858-automatically-adjust-request-limits.md">RFC 1858</a>, which called for a qualitatively better option for users and <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/rfcs/2020-04-06-1858-automatically-adjust-request-limits.md#prior-art">gestured toward</a> some possible inspirations.</li><li>Our engineers ultimately opted for a solution deeply inspired by analogous work on the Netflix engineering team, which is beautifully summarized in the <a href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/performance-under-load-3e6fa9a60581">Performance Under Load</a> piece on their blog. Our respective approaches utilize an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_increase/multiplicative_decrease">additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease</a> (AIMD) algorithm inspired by TCP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control">congestion control</a> algorithms. We'll have a lot more to say about this here on the blog next week. If you want to see the in-depth discussion that drove this process, see GitHub <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues/3255">issue #3255</a> on the Vector repo. There you'll see a pretty epic back and forth within our engineering team along with a slew of visualizations. It's quite the read.</li><li>As Netflix is largely a Java shop and there was nothing immediately usable "off the shelf" in the Rust ecosystem, we needed to create our own Rust implementation, which you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/tree/master/src/sinks/util/adaptive_concurrency">adaptive_concurrency</a> module. Of special importance is the concurrency <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/src/sinks/util/adaptive_concurrency/controller.rs#L23-L31">Controller</a>, which is responsible for the linear up/exponential down decision that I alluded to above.</li><li>For testing, the team mostly relied on our in-house <a href="https://github.com/timberio/http_test_server">http_test_server</a>, a pretty straightforward but highly customizable HTTP server written in Go.</li></ul><p>It took several months, some hefty PRs, and even a handful of <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/pull/3671">dead ends</a>, but we think that both the process and the end result are wholly consistent with the fastidious approach we strive for in building Vector.</p><h2>More to come</h2><p>Next week, we'll follow up on this announcement with a post from Timber's <a href="https://github.com/bruceg">Bruce Guenter</a>…</p></section></div>

<p>Today we are excited to announce the launch of StackHawk’s free Developer Plan. With this launch, engineering teams or individual developers can take ownership of security in the development and delivery of their applications. Read on to learn a bit more about why we are so excited to launch this, or jump right in to <a href="https://auth.stackhawk.com/signup">sign up for a free account</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-application-security-s-new-paradigm">Application Security’s New Paradigm</h3>



<p>It is no secret that the speed of application delivery has rapidly accelerated over the past decade. Most companies are pushing to production several times per week, or even multiple times per day. Originally, security struggled to keep up, with the dated models of quarterly penetration tests or manual scans by security teams clearly <a href="https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/application-security-is-broken/">no longer cutting it</a>.</p>



<p>These legacy models were predicated on finding vulnerabilities in production, often awhile after code had been deployed. This is at best, inefficient, and at worst a security issue. Once a vulnerability was found, it then had to navigate internal silos to actually get a fix released.</p>



<p>Modern engineering teams, however, have not only accelerated delivery speed, but have also improved security in the process. Here is how.</p>



<h4 id="h-find-vulnerabilities-with-ci-cd-automation">Find Vulnerabilities with CI/CD Automation</h4>



<p>Companies using modern approaches check for security vulnerabilities on every pull request (or even every commit) in the same way that they run unit tests and integration tests. With automated testing in CI/CD, developers can catch vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle, and fix issues while they are still in the context of the code.</p>



<p>After an initial triage of any existing security bugs, application security tooling should at least be configured to break the build if any new high criticality vulnerabilities are identified. This doesn’t mean that every vulnerability should prevent a deploy to production, but that deploy should be done eyes wide open to the risk it presents.</p>



<h4 id="h-triage-and-initial-risk-decisions-live-with-developers">Triage and Initial Risk Decisions Live with Developers</h4>



<p>When a vulnerability is found, the developer(s) who were recently working on the application are best equipped to review the finding and make risk-based decisions. Should this block the deploy to production? Can this be added to a backlog and addressed later? Is this low enough risk that it isn’t worth fixing?</p>



<p>The individuals who are intimately involved in creating the application are best equipped as the first-line of defense for these decisions. Internal security teams are undoubtedly called upon for clarification and support (…and are often reviewing historical decisions as well), but modern teams are empowering developers to make these triage decisions themselves.</p>



<h4 id="h-fast-developer-fixes">Fast Developer Fixes</h4>



<p>When a security bug requires a fix, the responsibility for the fix squarely lives with the developer who introduced the vulnerability in modern teams. This individual is in the codebase, familiar with the context of the recent vulnerability addition. Not only are they best equipped to implement the fix, but by democratizing this responsibility across the team, no person or team bears the burden of interrupt driven work.</p>



<h3 id="h-taking-ownership-of-application-security">Taking Ownership of Application Security</h3>



<p>Ever since we embarked upon building StackHawk, we have been laser focused on building a tool for developers. The market is rife with security tools built for the CISO that no developer wants to use, and these tools typically start at six-figure contracts. StackHawk is different, and we are excited to equip engineers to own the security of their application. This shows up in our product, and with our new free Developer Plan, it also shows up in our pricing.</p>



<p>Now individuals or teams can start running application security tests against their first application for free. There is no longer an excuse not to be looking at the security of your application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started with StackHawk is easy, with most developers completing their first security test in under 20 minutes. You can get the full details in <a href="https://docs.stackhawk.com/">our docs</a>, but in short it is as simple as building a yaml config, pointing the scanner at your application, and taking a look at the results.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://auth.stackhawk.com/signup">Sign up</a> for a free account and give it a try today!</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Karl Hughes. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I was in your shoes in 2011. I was finishing up a degree in mechanical engineering that I would never use and looking for a way to join a startup as a software developer.</p>



<p>Maybe it was the entrepreneur in me, and maybe it was just naivety, but instead of applying for jobs, I decided to start emailing interesting companies instead. I made a list of technology startups in the education industry and emailed each of them my pitch.</p>



<p>Two of them got back to me and one (<a href="https://www.uloop.com/">Uloop</a>) had an office three hours away in Nashville. I drove to meet their CEO and after a few conversations, they brought me on as a freelancer. When I graduated a few months later, they offered me a full-time role managing their blog and writing custom WordPress plugins.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve worked at three different edtech startups and never once had a formal “job interview.” Every company I’ve worked for has hired me because I met someone there and stayed in touch for months. When a job opened up, they reached out to me to see if I was interested.</p>



<p>My first job hunt showed me that your strength as a software developer is not in your resume, your knowledge of algorithms, your ability to keep up with the hottest frameworks, or even your problem-solving skills. <strong>The most powerful tool you have is your network.</strong></p>



<h2>The Employer’s Perspective</h2>



<p>As a job-seeker, you know that looking for a job is scary, but from an employer’s perspective, hiring is scary too.</p>



<p>After sitting in the hiring manager’s seat several times in the past few years, I can tell you that I’m as scared of hiring the wrong person as you are of screwing up the job interview. If I make a bad hire, I look bad to my boss, and my team’s productivity will suffer. Having to fire someone kills morale and hurts the manager’s reputation, so nobody wants to do it.</p>



<p>This fear is why managers look for people in their networks or work with recruiters. <strong>The very last place employers look for applicants is the cold resume bin.</strong></p>



<h2>How I Built My Network</h2>



<p>If you want to avoid the black hole of submitting your resume online, you need to build a network. I don’t know you well enough to give you a perfect formula for your situation, so I’ll just tell you how I built my network. I hope some of these ideas resonate.</p>



<p>First, I started as a freelancer before I ever had a “real” job as a programmer. Most people don’t recommend this approach for new developers, but it forced me to learn to “sell” myself really well. When I started with Uloop, I often had no idea how to accomplish a task, but I bet that I could learn it before they discovered I was making it up.</p>



<p>After getting that first job, I started attending meetups and conferences regularly. Uloop was a small company, so there wasn’t much opportunity to network within the organization, but I had moved to Chicago, where there were plenty of programming meetups and tech events to attend.</p>



<p>I tried meeting people at these events, but it was hard. I’m not that outgoing, so instead, I would email the event’s speaker or organizer afterward and invite them to a one-on-one coffee or lunch. Some of the people I met like this are among my closest mentors and friends today.</p>



<p>As I attended more meetups and got to know speakers and leaders, people started inviting me to give back. I was little more than a junior developer at the time, but I was asked to speak at bootcamps, meetups, and even a couple of small conferences because of my network.</p>



<p>Naturally, I was nervous the first few times I got up in front of a group to share my experience. I knew there were people in the crowd with decades of experience on me, and I expected them to stand up and call me out if I made any mistakes. I found that practice and gradually increasing the stakes helped me. By trying a talk out at a local meetup and slowly working up to larger audiences at a conference, I gained confidence over time.</p>



<p>Giving a talk at a meetup or conference is a lot of work, and you don’t typically get paid for it. That said, I knew how helpful it was hearing developers who were more experienced than me back when I was first learning to code, so I have always enjoyed the opportunity to give back.</p>



<p>One side effect of speaking is that you get even more opportunities to increase your network. At some point, I switched from being the one asking speakers to meet with me to the one that attendees were asking to speak with. I always enjoy these interactions with new developers, and the opportunity to encourage or help others is my primary motivation for speaking and writing this letter.</p>



<h2>Keeping in Touch</h2>



<p>Everyone who talks about networking tells you to go out and meet more people, but that’s <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">worthless if you don’t keep in touch with anyone</a>. As I started to meet more people in Chicago, I realized that I needed to come up with a way to have more encounters with each of them.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It takes on average about 3 encounters — and by that I mean intentional rather than passing interactions where you’ve gotten together primarily to just hang out — to really see if there’s potential for a relationship with someone.” – <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-3-encounter-rule/">Brett McKay</a></p></blockquote>



<p>The first step was to start a spreadsheet of people I wanted to keep up with. Most of them were more experienced than me, but many were peers or newer developers I “clicked” with or found interesting.</p>



<p>Next, I made a reminder to reach out to 1-2 people on the list every week. I’d ask how they were doing and see if they wanted to get lunch or coffee sometime. I tried to find organic reasons to connect (birthdays, an article related to their industry, etc.) and ask them questions about their lives. One of the easiest ways to make someone like you is to get them talking about something they like. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positive-prescription/201703/why-we-love-talking-about-ourselves">People love talking about themselves</a>.</p>



<p>While this sounds calculated, I do genuinely enjoy these conversations. We’re all busy, but having a system like this ensures that I don’t forget to maintain my network. If I ever feel like I’m no longer getting along with someone, I remove them from my list and no harm is done.</p>



<p>The reason most people don’t do this is that it takes a lot of time. I still spend 4-6 hours per week keeping in touch with or expanding my network. It may seem like a lot, but the investment has paid dividends and afforded me many interesting conversations and relationships along the way. This strategy of intentionally staying in touch with people has led to friendships, co-workers, job offers, and clients.</p>



<h2>Make It Yours</h2>



<p>No career advice will work for everyone.</p>



<p>I didn’t write this letter to give you a formula for networking, but rather to let you know that unconventional approaches can work. My network has been an invaluable asset, but luck and privilege played a huge part too.</p>



<p>If I hadn’t been able to drive three hours to take a meeting with my future boss, would he have hired me? If I needed to be home after work to help care for a family member, would I have been able to network at Meetups? If I weren’t a white male in an industry dominated by white males, would people have taken the time to meet with me?</p>



<p>I don’t know.</p>



<p>I have no idea what your career path will look like, but I hope my story gives you the courage to build a path that works for you.</p>

                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>I am really excited to announce today’s release of Qt 6.0. It is the first release of a new major version, and marks a major milestone for Qt. </span><strong><em>We started working on the initial ideas a few years ago, and since then, have put a massive effort into creating the next generation of Qt. </em></strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20email%20launch%20hero%201-png-1.png" alt="Qt 6"></span></a></p>

<p><span>Qt 5 has been a fantastic success over the years, and we have seen an enormous growth of our user base and Qt usage over eight years since we released Qt 5.0. But the world&nbsp; has undergone significant changes since 2012. Qt usage in embedded systems has skyrocketed, C++ has evolved, and new 3D graphics APIs have emerged. These are examples of factors that have directly affected Qt.</span></p>
<p><span>As a cross-platform framework, Qt needs to adjust to those changing requirements. We have managed to adapt very well to many of those requirements during the lifetime of Qt 5. However, maintaining full source and binary compatibility within the Qt 5 series made certain things impossible to fix within its lifetime. With Qt 6, we now have the opportunity to make changes and build Qt to be better suited for the years to come.</span><span></span></p>
<div>
<p>Thus, the mission of Qt 6 is to enable Qt to be the productivity platform for the future. Qt 6.0, as a major release of Qt, gave us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality, and better support today and tomorrow's requirements. Qt 6.0 is a continuation of the Qt 5 series, and we have focused on making migration non-disruptive for users. I published a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener">Qt 6 vision blog post</a> capturing those ideas around 18 months ago.</p>
<p>When creating Qt 6, we ensured that Qt’s core values have been adhered to and upheld, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its cross-platform nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single codebase</li>
<li>Its scalability from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li>Its world-class APIs and tools and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/" rel="noopener">documentation</a>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li>Its maintainability, stability, and compatibility, allowing users to maintain large codebases with minimal effort</li>
<li>Its large developer ecosystem with more than 1.5 million users</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt 6.0 is the first release of the Qt 6 series addressing new market demands while keeping the core values at the heart of what we do.</p>
<p>When developing Qt 6, we had an in-depth look at some of Qt's most central parts to identify how we could improve them. We discovered a couple of core focus areas that we invested considerable time in improving. Those areas include:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging C++17</li>
<li>Next generation QML</li>
<li>New graphics architecture</li>
<li>Unified 2D and 3D for Qt Quick</li>
<li>CMake build system (with qmake still supported for applications)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We have of course also spent time doing numerous improvements in other areas, too many to mention them all here, and I suggest you look at the more detailed <span><span><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_6.0" rel="noopener">wiki page</a>. We are also hosting Meet Qt 6.0 webinar sessions covering the <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607340244" rel="noopener">Americas/EMEIA</a> and <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607339968" rel="noopener">EMEIA/APAC</a> time zones. But let's take a look at some of the highlights.</span></span></p>
</div>
<h3><span>C++17</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png" width="168" alt="C++ 17 in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=84&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 84w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 168w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=252&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 252w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=336&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 336w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=420&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 420w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=504&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 504w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px"></span></p>
<p><span>With Qt 6 we now require a C++17 compatible compiler enabling the use more modern C++ language constructs when developing Qt and also allows for integration points on the API side.</span></p>
<h3><span>Core libraries and APIs</span></h3>
<p><span>Much work has gone into Qt Core, as it is the module that implements the most central parts of Qt. We've gone through many areas there and made improvements. To name some of the most central ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The new <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/property-bindings-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">property and binding system</a>: This system now brings the concept of bindings that made QML such a huge success in Qt 5 available from C++. </span></li>
<li><span>Strings and Unicode: With Qt 5, we started aligning Qt fully with Unicode, where we completed a lot of the work, but a few items remained that we now cleaned up for Qt 6. More details will come in a separate blog post later on.</span></li>
<li><span>QList has been a class that was often criticized in Qt 5, as it was heap allocating objects stored in there that were larger than a pointer, leading to pressure on heap allocation methods. In Qt 6, we changed this and unified QList and QVector into one class. See our <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qlist-changes-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post about QList</a> in Qt 6 for details.</span></li>
<li><span>QMetaType and QVariant are fundamental to how our Qt’s meta-object system works. Signals and slots would not be possible without QMetaType and QVariant is required for dynamic invocations. Those two classes got an almost complete rewrite with Qt 6, and you can read about the details <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/whats-new-in-qmetatype-qvariant" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other parts of Qt that are not related to graphics have also seen large changes. For example, Qt Concurrent has undergone an almost complete rewrite and now makes development of multi-threaded applications more effortless than ever. Qt Network has seen lots of clean-up and improvements. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-network-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post</a> for details.</span></p>
<h3><span>New graphics architecture</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></h3>
<p><span>The graphics architecture of Qt 5 was very much dependent on OpenGL as the underlying 3D graphics API. While this was the right approach in 2012 when we created Qt 5, the market around us has changed significantly over the last couple of years with the introduction of Metal and Vulkan. We now have a large set of different graphics APIs that are commonly being used on different platforms. For Qt as a cross-platform framework, this, of course, meant that we had to adjust to this and ensure our users can run Qt on all of them with </span>maximum performance.</p>

<p><span>So while Qt 5 relied on OpenGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, the picture completely changes with Qt 6. All of our 3D graphics in Qt Quick is now built on top of a new abstraction layer for 3D graphics called RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface). RHI makes it possible for Qt to use the native 3D graphics API of the underlying OS/platform. So Qt Quick will now use Direct3D on Windows and Metal on macOS by default. For details, have a look at the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/graphics-in-qt-6.0-qrhi-qt-quick-qt-quick-3d" rel="noopener">blog post series about the RHI</a>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OpenGL specific classes in Qt still exist, but are now moved out of QtGui in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-index.html" rel="noopener">QtOpenGL</a> module. We also added a new module called <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtshadertools-index.html" rel="noopener">QtShaderTools</a> to deal with the different shading languages of those APIs in a cross-platform way.</span></p>
<h3><span>Qt Quick 3D and Qt 3D</span></h3>
<p><span>Qt Quick 3D is a relatively new module. It seamlessly extends Qt Quick with 3D capabilities. With Qt Quick 3D, our focus was to create an API that is as easy to use as the existing parts of Qt Quick (for 2D user interfaces) while providing full support for creating complex 3D scenes. The main goal behind this effort has been to enable seamless integration between 2D and 3D content.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This module has seen significant improvements with Qt 6 that we wouldn’t have been able to do in the Qt 5 series. Most importantly it is now always using the RHI abstraction layer to make optimal use of the underlying graphics API and Hardware. Additionally, it now features a much deeper and more performant integration between 2D and 3D content, allowing you to place 2D items into a 3D scene. It also has vastly improved support for glTF2 and physics-based rendering, making it trivial to import assets created in other design tools. There are many other major improvements in the module, a more in-depth description can be found in a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/what-is-new-in-qt-quick-3d-6.0" rel="noopener">separate blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 3D is now also based on top of the RHI abstraction layer, has seen some performance improvements and cleanups. You can find more details in two blog posts by our partner KDAB (<a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt-3d-changes-in-qt-6/" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt3d-renderer-qt6/" rel="noopener">here</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span>Desktop styling for Qt Quick</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20Desktop%20Styling-png.png" alt="Desktop Styling in Qt 6"></span></p>
<p><span>When we created the set of controls for Qt Quick, our focus was to make them lightweight and performant. For that reason, they did not support desktop styling in Qt 5. However, in Qt 6, we found a way to make them look &amp; feel native on desktop operating systems. With 6.0, Qt Quick now supports native styling on both macOS and Windows. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls" rel="noopener">blog post for details</a>.</span><span> Native look &amp; feel for Android and Linux already existed with the Material and Fusion styles in Qt 5. We are improving those for future Qt releases and are also planning to implement a native style for iOS.</span></p>
<h3><span>Interfacing with platform specific functionality</span></h3>
<p><span>Even with Qt offering most functionality required to develop your application platform-independently, there is sometimes a need to interface with platform-specific functionality. In Qt 5, we provided a set of add-on modules (QtX11Extras, QtWinExtras, QtMacExtras) to help with this purpose. But this full separation from the rest of Qt has led to a couple of architectural issues, inconsistencies and code duplication within Qt. In Qt 6, we made an effort to clean this up and fold the functionality offered by those add-on modules into platform specific APIs offered directly in Qt. This will make interfacing with OS/platform-specific APIs much easier in Qt 6. Have a look <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/platform-apis-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;for more details.</span></p>
<h3><span>Build system and&nbsp;</span><span>Packaging</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png" width="189" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=95&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 95w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 189w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=284&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 284w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=378&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 378w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=473&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 473w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=567&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 567w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></span></p>
<p><span>We also made some considerable changes in how we build and distribute Qt.&nbsp; Worth mentioning is that Qt 6 itself is now <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system" rel="noopener">built using CMake</a>. This has also led to significant improvements for all our users that use CMake to build their projects. We will continue to support qmake for the lifetime of Qt 6, so there is no need to make any changes to your build system if you're using it, but we recommend to use CMake for all new projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6 also comes with a much smaller default package, and many of the add-ons are now distributed as separate packages through a package manager. This gives us more flexibility in adapting release schedules of add-ons to market requirements, allowing, for example, for more frequent feature releases as the core Qt packages or making them available for multiple Qt versions at the same time. In addition, we can use the package manager as a delivery channel for 3rd party content. And finally, it gives our users more flexibility as they can choose to download only what they really need. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, we are using the existing Qt …</span></p></span></p></div></div>

December 8, 2020 | https://dataform.co/blog/dataform-is-joining-google-cloud | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dataform.co/blog/dataform-is-joining-google-cloud">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today we're excited to announce that we've joined Google Cloud. Over the course of the past several months, our partnership with Google Cloud has deepened and we believe that our new combined efforts can make our customers and partners even more successful.</p><div><div><p>To our customers, users, supporters and contributors - today, we are extremely excited to share that Dataform is joining Google Cloud!</p>
<p>Before we jump into the story, let us quickly answer what we think will be the most important questions for existing and new users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataform Web will continue to be run and maintained by us, as part of Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will be free for all new users as of today, December 8th 2020.</li>
<li>Existing customers will be transitioned onto the free plan immediately.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will focus on support for BigQuery going forward.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ll be working closely with the rest of the Google Cloud Data Analytics team over the next year to deliver our vision for Dataform within Google Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three years ago we started Dataform with a mission to <strong>empower analysts to manage the entire flow of data in the warehouse, using a single, unified workflow</strong>. Throughout our journey weâ€™ve been focused on giving data analysts and data engineers the tools they need to take raw, messy data, transform it, and put it into the hands of their organization. Weâ€™ve only just scratched the surface of this problem and solving it will continue to be our core mission and focus going forward.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve followed Googleâ€™s products and successes within analytics closely over the past few years, and always felt that they were a product leader when it came to cloud data warehousing, SQL, and now business intelligence; with products such as Looker that inspired us significantly in our own journey. After several conversations with the Google Cloud team it became clear that we are deeply aligned on the importance of serving analysts with the right tools and technology in order to fill what we all perceive as a missed opportunity in existing solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a team of just 7, in a complex, competitive and rapidly changing market, we had more ideas than we had people or resources to accomplish. There has always been so much more we wanted to do each quarter than we could achieve. With the support of the BigQuery and Cloud Analytics teams and our combined thought leadership and efforts, we felt that together we could achieve something bigger than we could separately.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some changes to the product and how we operate over the coming years, but one thing that will not change is our commitment to the principles that we feel have gotten us this far: working closely with our customers, making sure we continue to collect and act upon your feedback, and a laser focus on doing one thing and doing it well.</p>
<p>At Dataform we always felt we were delivering a unique and innovative product to our customers and the data community. With Googleâ€™s support, we have even more confidence in our ability to build and deliver a product that can truly change the way that all companies, large and small, work with data. </p>
<p>In the coming months weâ€™ll be able to share more details of our product roadmap. In the meantime please reach out to us if you have any questions. Thank you again for joining us on this journey. Weâ€™re uncomfortably excited about what we can accomplish together over the coming years!</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>â€˜Darkâ€™ personalities come in</strong> various shades, but at the core of all of them is a tendency to callously use others for personal gain. What is it that these types of people are really gaining, though? Might a benevolent approach to life and others be even more advantageous?</p>
<p>For <span>15 years,</span> research into dark personality traits (including narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) has been rapidly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">expanding</a>. We now know that these traits are far more <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32484407" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evident</a>, on average, in men than women. We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">approximately</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-13625-018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span>1-2 per cent</span></a> of individuals in the general population display extremely dark personality features â€“ enough to meet the clinical threshold for a personality disorder â€“ and about <span>10-20 per</span> cent of individuals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22996170/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">have</a> moderately elevated levels. We know that even people with moderate levels of dark traits can wreak havoc: they are more likely to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616666070" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">lie and cheat</a>, show <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305468" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">racist</a> attitudes, and be <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-04417-005" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent</a> towards others.</p>
<p>As researchers, we have studied these traits ourselves. But in a bid to balance out the extensive literature on dark traits, we have recently started to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">focus</a> on the light side of human personality instead â€“ the â€˜everyday saintsâ€™ among us. These people are genuinely interested in others and treat them well without question, not as a means to an end. They applaud the success of others, believe in the fundamental goodness of humans, and respect the dignity of everyone. Our recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692030310X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 36,000 adults suggests that these traits are common: around <span>30-50 per cent</span> of people show prominent light personality trait profiles, depending on world region, and these traits are particularly common in women.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand which personality profile â€“ dark or light â€“ leads to more success and happiness in the long run. There is an oft-touted saying that â€˜Nice guys finish lastâ€™ and, on the face of it, this might seem correct. If youâ€™re always expending your energy caring about others, perhaps youâ€™re bound to get left behind. If youâ€™re willing to deceive and exploit others without worrying about their feelings, you can look after â€˜number oneâ€™ and rise faster to the top. But does the research back this up?</p>
<p>Experimental studies support the idea of a â€˜successfulâ€™ dark personality, but only up to a point. One <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-11168-026" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that people with psychopathic personality traits win more points on a negotiation task where they are required to compete with a partner, but fewer points on a task that involves cooperation. Those with dark traits are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-018-9823-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">more</a> likely to â€˜defectâ€™ in the classic Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma task â€“ an approach that means maximising your own outcome while duping the other participant.</p>
<p>But their success in the real world is questionable. In corporate settings, those with dark personality traits are slightly more likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51219-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emerge</a> as leaders and are seen as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.925" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">charismatic</a> but, when it comes to getting the job done, they tend to achieve less and are considered poor team players. Our recent study also found that political figures with dark personality traits are more likely to get elected and hold their positions, but other studies <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615611922" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">show</a> that they are much poorer at getting legislation passed. Hedge fund managers with these traits generally <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217733080" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">obtain</a> significantly lower financial returns on the investment funds they manage. Overall, individuals with dark traits <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0025679" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">engage</a> in more counterproductive work behaviour, such as theft and abusive supervision. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they donâ€™t end up with higher average incomes than their peers with light personalities.</p>
<p>Through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on</p>
<p>On top of this, those with dark personality traits donâ€™t have much luck outside of work. Even if they manage to avoid prison (imprisonment being a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18837606/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">high</a> possibility for those with extreme traits), they are at increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suicide</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556964/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent death</a>. They are also not particularly happy: people with dark traits tend to report poor self-image, an inability to intimately connect with others, and little life satisfaction. In contrast, we found that those with light personality trait profiles have fulfilling, intrinsically rewarding lives: they generally have a more positive view of themselves, more positive connections with others and find life more satisfying.</p>
<p>The key factor here seems to be empathy: the capacity to resonate with â€“ and understand the perspective of â€“ the emotional experiences of others. Individuals with light personality traits show a great deal of empathy for others, while those with dark personality traits tend to show very little. In our new research, we found that this seems to be what leads to a more satisfying life. Similarly, being prosocial â€“ acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others â€“ is also significantly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-65092-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> with higher wellbeing.</p>
<p>As a species, weâ€™re fundamentally built for social connectedness, and we depend on cooperation and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.14.3.137" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">trust</a>. When those with dark personalities try to take advantage of this for their own personal gain, they do so at their own peril. In essence, through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on. While those with dark traits might initially capture the attention of others, their social behaviour ultimately leads to limited success in work or politics, and little satisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>So far, we have</strong> made it seem as though people fall into one of two binary groups: dark or light. But in reality, thereâ€™s a third group: we found that about <span>40 per cent</span> of individuals show a balance of dark and light traits. People in this mixed group are similar to the light group when it comes to critical variables involving empathy and social connectedness, but they still show some dark tendencies â€“ hampering their relationships to some degree with deceitful, self-absorbed or hurtful behaviour toward others.</p>
<p>Some might think that the mixed group is the optimal place to be: youâ€™re able to have some connection with others, but wonâ€™t be taken as a pushover. But compared with those with a light personality, mixed individuals have lower levels of life satisfaction and a less positive self-image. It seems that the mixed group are on the way to the light personality profile, so to speak, but fall short of the full expression â€“ and the added dark traits are whatâ€™s holding them back.</p>
<p>As people age â€“ particularly from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles</p>
<p>Regardless of where you fall on these dimensions of personality, we <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">believe</a> in the fundamental ability to grow and change. Large-scale studies have <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0024950" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">documented</a> that your general personality (eg, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness) continues to change throughout your lifetime, and weâ€™ve found the same to be true when it comes to light and dark traits.</p>
<p>Specifically, we found that the extent to which you exhibit light or dark personality traits tends to shift as you get older. As people age â€“ particularly as they progress from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles. Other <a href="https://content.apa.org/record/2014-34008-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that moral character traits, such as conscientiousness and self-control, are generally more common in older people. Age doesnâ€™t completely account for the results â€“ younger people can display light personality traits â€“ but the research suggests that what can fundamentally differentiate light and dark profiles is a process of psychological maturation.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417734875" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">born</a> with an innate sense of fairness, though this is a limited ability. Thus, like language, it is a skill that requires further development. Our research, and studies of our closest relatives, nonhuman primates, both show that moral behaviour can emerge and change across development â€“ in large part through cooperative social interactions. Thus, by embracing and trusting social connections, we can progress toward a light personality trait profile â€“ a pathway that appears to lead to healthy self-actualisation and even transcendence.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re curious about where you fall on the light vs dark personality spectrum, you can answer the <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">questions</a> we used in our study. We have now tested more than 250,000 individuals from across the globe, and you can see how your responses compare with the average. And remember, there is always scope for change: we believe in the fundamental ability to grow and transcend self-centredness through deliberate and sustained changes in our patterns of behaviour and thinking.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to <em>want</em> to change. Unfortunately, most people with extreme levels of dark personality traits donâ€™t want to change who they are. Despite not being particularly happy with their lives, they remain fixated on what they think they need: more and more power, wealth and domination over others.</p>
<p>Of course, some days weâ€™re all motivated to shut out other people, and simply look out for ourselves. This can be especially true when it seems that those who cheat, deceive and take advantage of others are somehow getting ahead. But rest assured that this doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. We have found that being empathic and connected to others â€“ capitalising on our fundamentally social nature â€“ is ultimately the pathway to a more rewarding life.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 8, 2020 | https://curiosum.dev/blog/elixir-key-skills-junior | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curiosum.dev/blog/elixir-key-skills-junior">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Elixir is not magic - despite being easy to write in and learn, you need a strong foundation. In this short article, I will give you my personal list of things that are necessary (or at least very much a “should-have”) for Junior Elixir developers.</p><div>
<p>The power of Elixir is considerable - it is a functional language compiled to <a href="https://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a>, so you get amazing concurrency and uptime. A narrow core or powerful tools and utilities open a whole world of possibilities and manage complexity as very few languages can. What you write will be able to run for a long time, will tolerate faults, and be easily scalable.</p>
<p>The syntax you will be working with is one of the easiest to learn and conceptualize, especially to those with a flavor of Ruby in their experience. Even to complete newcomers, good building tools and growing vaults of libraries allow a smoother learning curve. Elixir community simply rocks - although, admittedly, it is not huge.</p>
<p>That’s the good part - but let’s get a bit more specific.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A sense of concurrency and scale</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS and server stuff</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Databases</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline-style data processing</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>General Adaptability (tinkering)</strong>  
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>1.  A sense of concurrency and scale</h2>
<p>What is concurrency? Imagine computing as a race, which is won only when every competitor finishes the track. In most cases, the runners (processes) are tied together with a rope - when one fails, the rest cannot move much further. What if you untie the racers, and let them finish in whatever order they like, without affecting the final result?</p>
<p>Concurrency is usually not the first or third thing beginner developers start from, but at worst, Elixir developers should prepare themselves early. Elixir has many applications, but where the magic truly happens is if you need to do a lot at the same time. Unlike the more intertwined ways other technologies work, Elixir can skim through several processes flopping at the same time - as probably, dozens more will run independently and fault-free in the background.</p>
<p>Without this coupling, an Elixir system can have some self-repairing qualities, its processes are very light, and therefore can be run on all CPUs at the same time. In this respect, Elixir is like its father, Erlang, which is described as “write once, run forever”. They both share a concurrency model, which is markedly different than the usual threading. The key distinction here is this:</p>
<p><em>You share data by passing messages</em></p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p><em>Passing messages to share data</em></p>
<p>If this is not clear (it is much clearer in practice), head <a href="https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/concurrency/" target="_blank">here</a> to read a little bit more about how Elixir manages concurrency. For a more descriptive account, listen to this <a href="https://www.devnlife.com/episodes/elixir-concurrency-vs-parallelism-games-with-code" target="_blank">podcast episode</a> from Dev’n Life.</p>
<p>You will need a strong grasp of concurrency and the underlying actor model to start doing more complex things in Elixir, and therefore, to jump up in seniority. Start early!  </p>
<h2>2.  HTTPS and server stuff</h2>
<p>A lot of your future work in Elixir will be related to web apps. Therefore, more generally, it will be governed at some level by the HTTP protocol and server infrastructure.</p>
<p>Elixir is armed with some sneakily good web frameworks - I’m talking Phoenix and Absinthe, to name the most popular. But you can’t do much in them without at least basic knowledge of how the web works.</p>
<p>There are several things I would start with. First, learn the basic request-response communication cycle, which is nicely <a href="https://medium.com/@jen_strong/the-request-response-cycle-of-the-web-1b7e206e9047" target="_blank">explained here</a>. You should not only know the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" target="_blank">HTTP status codes</a> but what to do when they occur. A useful distinction is that between POST and PUT methods, and there is a good <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107390/whats-the-difference-between-a-post-and-a-put-http-request" target="_blank">explainer thread</a> over at Stack Overflow. This one-hour video will bring you up to speed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sovAIX4doOE" target="_blank">using cookies in HTTP</a>. Next, polish your knowledge of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" target="_blank">HTTP headers</a>, courtesy of Mozilla. A nice finishing touch for this starting inventory would be some Web Socket knowledge. It is a broad topic, but read <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/websockets-tutorial-how-to-go-real-time-with-node-and-react-8e4693fbf843/" target="_blank">this blog</a> post to get the basics.</p>
<p>If you have most of the above covered and want to build up the case for future promotions, learn some DevOps practices and philosophy. Beginner level tutorials are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtvpS5eVVDs" target="_blank">youtube</a>, with dozens of free or cheap courses available in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/topic/devops/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=devops" target="_blank">Coursera</a>. This will come in handy both for Elixir work, and server.</p>
<h2>3.  Databases</h2>
<p>If you struggled with databases in your previous technology - worry not, Elixir will make your life a bit better. And if you have no relevant experience, Elixir will not throw many logs under your legs during the learning process.</p>
<p>Do not get too happy yet - Elixir, as I will explain in the last point of this list, is not for those, who want everything out of the box. With databases, a typical Ruby deployment will do a lot of stuff for you, like the creation of the initial database and seeding it. In Elixir, however, some of it is on you.</p>
<p>After the initial hurdle, Elixir fares extremely well. Its database wrapper (<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Ecto</a>) handles both SQL and NoSQL. It is even more than that, as it is also a <a href="https://errolhassall.com/blog/2018/6/17/elixir-connecting-to-databases-part-1" target="_blank">language integrated query</a>.</p>
<p>Since you will spend considerable time developing apps with PostgreSQL or some similar SQL databases for data storage in your project, knowing how Elixir works with them is a useful thing to flash during the recruitment process.  </p>
<h2>4.  Pipeline-style data processing</h2>
<p>As Elixir is a functional language, it heavily promotes data processing that can be described as pipelines modeled as compositions of functions that transform immutable data structures. If you find this style of data processing comfortable, you will feel at home. Once you get more advanced, libraries such as GenStage or Flow will make you feel at home applying it in a distributed environment, which is one of Elixir’s main strengths.</p>
<p>There are interesting case studies and workshops to listen to and watch on this topic. For an authoritative source, <a href="https://youtu.be/tPu-P97-cbE" target="_blank">try recordings</a> from ElixirConf, or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLjWbathKEQ" target="_blank">this</a> short explainer.  </p>
<h2>5.  Become a Master Tinkerer</h2>
<p>Who is a tinkerer? In short, it is a person who, when seeing an unknown button or dial, is going to press it - just for the, ekhm, sake of it. A person that wants to go deep into things, and is persistent enough to look for their own solutions, where there may be none present yet.</p>
<p>The whole idea behind Elixir is, that you have a powerful core, that must be supplemented by libraries that contain the “extra” functionalities. This was done to reduce bloat and keep processes inherently light and quick. This philosophy also permeates to the library creators themselves.</p>
<p>So when you try to find a very specific library for a niche task, this is not Java or Ruby - where a short trip through GitHub will give you 20 proposed solutions. In some cases, be prepared to write stuff on your own. Elixir is exceptionally extendable. Its core and the underlying power of BEAM VM are meant to be applicable to a very broad set of use cases.</p>
<p>The main tools to broaden what Elixir can do are <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2017/12/07/macro-madness-how-to-use-use-well" target="_blank">macros</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/sigils.html" target="_blank">sygils</a>, and I advise to get familiar with at least those two.   </p>
<p><em>Good luck on your path to Elixir excellence! 
Michał</em></p>

        <p>A fraction of our behaviors are governed by patterns that, upon closer examination, reveal significant steps in personal development. This article is intended for those who wish to introspect and recognize their patterns as part of the necessary step to grow and prevent becoming an oppressor.</p>

<p>In common use, to believe oneself free is to deny the existence of the causes that explain one’s behavior. To say “I was free to go by the left or by the right” actually means “I don’t know the reasons that make me take one path rather than another”, the reasons exist, we just don’t know them<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This is the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>.</p>

<p>Those who believe they are free tend to believe that others are free for the same reasons. Believing that others act freely is then equivalent to denying the existence of causes in their actions. To say “this person is free to become an engineer or an artist” actually means “I don’t know why this person is in this career rather than another”.</p>

<h2 id="deny">Deny</h2>

<p>Denying the existence of causes is not an isolated problem and Etienne Klein illustrates this very well through a funny anecdote (video in French):</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fj5r1ry2TTU?start=217" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other day […], I was giving a lecture at Central [Grande École in France] on relativity and I was doing the same calculation of Einstein’s 1905 calculation in which they show that the duration of a phenomenon depends on the speed of the observer in relation to this phenomenon […]. At the end of the demonstration a pupil asks to speak and says to everyone “Sir, I do not agree with Einstein”. I was happy, I had a student who had a critical mind, I ask him to argue. I was expecting him to talk about Poincaré who restores the luminiferous aether… in short, to argue. That he would argue from arguments that come from physics and the guy says “Sir I don’t believe the dilation of time because I don’t feel it”. In other words, this young man who was accepted in Centrale, <em>thought that his feeling, his subjectivity, had a power great enough to be able to discredit what a century of objectification has made it possible to establish</em>. - Etienne Klein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our case, it is not about physical phenomena but about human behavior. People denying (consciously or not) the deterministic character on which our behavior depends, oppose the theories that are more than a century old, such as the social determinism of Emile Durkeim for example. This attitude, in addition to being obsolete, is dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="dangers">Dangers</h2>

<p>Omitting the reasons for human behavior leads to difficult situations that are encountered in many different contexts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A bad parent gets angry at its child without trying to understand the reasons for its child’s misbehavior. In fact, the child felt lonely throughout dinner and wanted to get someone’s attention.</li>
  <li>A bad manager blames an employee without trying to find the reasons for the delay. In fact, what was asked for in the first place didn’t make much sense when looking at it more closely and a redesign was required, making the delivery as late as necessary.</li>
  <li>A bad engineer denigrates the misuse of a system by a user without ever trying to meet the person. In fact, no user input control was implemented, leaving the system capable of harming itself.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting rid of the need to understand others generates a lot of frustration, especially if it involves a hierarchical relationship. If at the level of a team, “first accountability and then blame” is disastrous, imagine at the level of a nation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, the frequency of torture is always a sign of faith or laziness in the Government. There is no evil that cannot be made good for something. Jean-Jacques Rousseau — Du contrat social (1762)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>

<p>So where does this trend come from? There are many reasons. Etienne Klein explains it by laziness and narcissism: “I find that this relativism, when it is too strong, is a perfect legitimization of <em>intellectual laziness</em>, that you can judge what is going on in Nature from your subjectivity alone, sometimes even from your narcissism alone. It relieves you of having to learn a couple of things about quantum mechanics, particle physics or the Higgs boson”.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias or <em>conflict of interest</em> stem also that tendency. This is why, a manager of a team prefers to believe that another team is intrinsically incompetent rather than investing some of my resources in training them.</p>

<p>Last example: <em>who would boast of not being free?</em> It is even the first term of the French national motto “liberty, equality, fraternity”.</p>

<p>Although these reasons can be explained, they are no less dangerous. So what can be done?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Recognize that <em>freedom is limited</em>. Don’t see this as a fatality; on the contrary, it is the essential point for growing up. Consider this as a constraint of the system you are designing, which hidden, cannot help to find the appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Once acknowledged, areas for improvement will come naturally. Some disciplines such as UX design have understood this early on. A designer will adjust the interface if many users interact in unexpected ways. User behaviors prevail over the designer’s wishes or predictions. Thanks to the trends in human behavior that UX has been able to establish principles, evaluate them, refine them, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Are we free? Should we fight for our freedom? This article does not pretend to answer these questions. On the other hand, a fraction of our behaviors seem to be governed by patterns that, if we take the time to look into them, reveal actionable steps for personal development. Denying these patterns and neglecting the need to understand them is a lost opportunity to improve and may turn into oppression.</p>

<p>Assuming our behavior as the result of an unpredictable phenomenon is firstly a sign of narcissism, but above all a denial of the ability to introspect, to recognize our patterns, to understand ourselves, in other words, to grow. Expanding that idea to others is dangerous. Considering the behavior of others as absolutely unforeseeable is first naive toward the social sciences, but it is above all to rid ourselves of the responsibility to understand, to empathize, in fact to free the other. <a href="https://twitter.com/arnaud_debec/status/1332434506112970753">So acknowledge you live in a cage before planning to escape</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Over the past 8 weeks, I built a HomeKit accessory to open and close the gate at the end of my driveway.  The project was really fun, and this document outlines the process of creating it, from concept to working prototype.</p>

<h3 id="additional-background">Additional Background</h3>

<p>Programming examples for microcontrollers will be in C++.  For the most part, we’ll be sticking essentially to “C with Classes”, which is typical of most Arduino and other microcontroller projects.</p>

<p>The data in this document is by no means meant to be comprehensive.  I am not an electrical engineer, and welcome any corrections or other feedback.  Where possible, I’ve cited references or resources I found useful at each step.  For the most part, extensive googling served as the primary research tool.</p>

<p>The swing gate in question is a Sentex Crown Jewel, which was available in the early 2000s. It interfaces with a home phone system to control 1 or 2 relays.  Programming is performed either via the gate keypad, or via 300 baud modem connected to a Windows program.  Later in this document we’ll show how to use a listening modem to eavesdrop on the communication to reverse engineer the app-only commands which are not in the publicly available references.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>The problem I aimed to solve was to interface the gate microcontroller to HomeKit.  The only interfaces to the gate are a keypad (outside the gate) and a home phone line.  The previous owners did not install the manual operation switch, so I would frequently forget to open the gate when walking into town, get to the gate, then go back inside to dial the phone access code.  It would be great to just pull out a phone or say “hey Siri open the gate”.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to decompose the goal into tasks small enough that each can have easily understandable requirements and success criteria.  Another benefit of this process is that having many small tasks to complete will give us a sense of accomplishment and provide motivation as we complete them 🙂</p>

<h3 id="problem-1---phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Problem 1 - Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h3>

<p>Objective: Implement software library that can send and receive phone number tones, and communicate with a 300 baud modem.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones to keep HomeKit state in sync when other users control the gate from the phone line.</li>
  <li>Take phone off hook and dial numbers to control gate relay.</li>
  <li>Communicate via 300 baud modem (Bell 103) protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-2---homekit-support">Problem 2 - HomeKit Support</h3>

<p>Objective: The microcontroller + phone line interface should appear as a home kit accessory.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Successfully pair the device with HomeKit</li>
  <li>Implement a service that  allows opening and closing the gate</li>
  <li>Demonstrate control via “Hey Siri open the gate”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-3---physical-prototype">Problem 3 - Physical prototype</h3>

<p>Objective: Combine the proofs of concept of the phone interface, and homekit device, into a single logic board, have that board manufactured, and enclose it in a case.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capture a schematic which contains all necessary circuits for correct operation of the system.</li>
  <li>Arrange the physical design of those components and signals into a printed circuit board using a CAD program.</li>
  <li>Manufacture the board.</li>
  <li>Enclose the assembled board in a case so we can handle it safely and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h2>

<p>The first piece of the project is the phone line interface.  Reviewing the requirements from earlier, our first requirement is “Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones”.</p>

<p>Decomposing this further, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand how to interface a microcontroller to a phone line</li>
  <li>Understand how to take the phone “off hook”</li>
  <li>Do some signal processing to detect tones, for example, someone pressing the number “9” on a phone keypad.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-access-arrangement">Digital Access Arrangement</h3>

<p>In the United States, home phone lines usually consist of a pair of wires, Tip and Ring, with a nominal -48VDC between them.  These wires carry the signal (voice or data), and the voltage and resistance between them indicates various states (on hook, off hook, ringing, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service" title="Wikipedia Plain Old Telephone Service">Additional info at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Since the voltage on the lines (48v) is well above that typically interfaced to a microcontroller (1.8-5.0v), we need some circuitry to extract the signal from the phone line, convert it to a voltage compatible with our processor.  Additionally, this circuitry should provide isolation of our circuitry from the phone circuit, to protect against transient voltage spikes.  A nice discussion of isolation is <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN1167.pdf" title="Safety Considerations for Silicon Labs Series Capacitor Isolators">here</a>.  In this application we’ve chosen to use a surge suppression capacitor that will fail open but magnetic isolation via a small transformer is also common in modem designs.</p>

<p>Since there are quite a few components in even simplified / cost reduced DAA’s (see page 21, &lt;&gt;) I opted to buy a reference board for the <a href="https://ixysic.com/Products/LITELINK.htm">Ixys CPC5622 Litelink III DAA</a>. Additional info can be found in the <a href="https://www.ixysic.com/home/pdfs.nsf/www/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf/$file/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf">CPC5622-EVAL Evaluation Board Users Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-arduino-uno">Integration With Arduino Uno</h3>

<p>Connecting the Eval board for the Litelink DAA to the Arduino so that we can start looking at phone line signals is pretty straight forward.  Looking at the Fritzing diagram below, we’ve connected an I2C oled to the Uno so we can see what’s happening.  The eval board implements DC-blocking capacitors on the TX/RX lines, so we implement a voltage divider with a pair of resistors, and connect the RX line (pink) from the 5622 to A0 on the Uno, putting the “zero point” at 1.65V (3.3/2).  We wire up a phone jack to the J1 header on the eval board, and we connect 3.3v through a 10k resistor to AREF on the Uno, setting the analog reference for ADC measurements at 3.3 * 32/(32+10) == 2.5v.  Since the Uno doesn’t have a differential ADC, the Vpp (peak to peak voltage) on the RX+ line from the eval board should be &lt;1V so we shouldn’t clip under normal operation, and get more precision out of the ADC by using more of its range vs. the standard 0-5V.  “Off Hook” (orange) is pulled up as required by the 5622.</p>

<p><img src="https://sampo3k.github.io/images/fritzing.jpg" alt="5622EVAL Fritzing"></p>

<p>Success!  At this point, we can read A0, and see the voltage held roughly constant at 1.65v when on hook, and if you pick up a receiver on the phone line connected to the 5622, you will start seeing the voltage vary as the call progress (dial) tone is received, or connect an oscilloscope and visualize it.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</h3>

<p>Now we have an analog signal into our Uno, and can move on to the next requirement: decode DTMF tones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling" title="Link to Wikipedia article on DTMF">Dual-tone multi-frequency</a> (DTMF) is way each key on a phone key pad is converted into analog signals.  The wikipedia article does a really good job summarizing what’s going on.</p>

<p>At this point we need to do some Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to figure out which frequencies are present in the signal we’re receiving, and then see if there are exactly two strong signals that happen to be one of the 16 DTMF pairs.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go too deeply into DSP here, but for a better understanding of what we’re trying to do, I cannot recommend these two resources highly enough.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/">Intro to DSP</a>: This website has amazing interactive tutorials that explains some of the fundamentals of digital signal processing in a really neat and useful way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">DSP book</a>: This book is a wealth of information on DSP techniques, and the PDFs of each chapter are available for free.  With some effort, you can even concatenate them together into the entire book :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tone-detection">Tone Detection</h3>

<p>For DTMF, the typical sequence we are looking for is &gt;=100ms of tone and &gt;=100ms of silence repeated for however many digits we are listening for.</p>

<p>The common approach to frequency detection is an FFT.  However, the performance of the 16MHz ATMega328P makes this difficult.  For example, we need the FFT bins about 70Hz apart or less to discriminate the DTMF tones.  So that means at 8KHz we need roughly  8000/70 = 114 samples or more.  Rounding up to a convenient power of 2 for the FFT, we’ll say 256/2 = 128 FFT bins. The bins will be 8KHz / 128 = 62.5Hz apart.</p>

<p>To do a 256 sample FFT, in addition to a reasonable amount of memory, we’d need something on the order of ~8k multiplies and ~8k additions, which given the performance of 16x16+32 MAC is around 50 cycles, our most wildly optimistic projection here if we hand coded a great FFT is like 25-30ms, or about 0.5x realtime. This seems to line up well with the results on this <a href="https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2019/03/arduino-fft-pt-2-improving-the-hardware-for-real-time-analysis/" title="Arduino FFT pt. 2: Improving the Hardware for Real-time Analysis">Arduino FFT post</a>. We also use the same performance hack noted there to reduce the ADC prescaler on the ATMega328 so that ADC reads don’t take so long.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm">Goertzel algorithm</a> which is essentially a single-frequency digital filter.  Doing 8 applications of the Goertzel algorithm including the ADC reads only takes about 12ms, which is about 1.2x realtime.  I think, based on the output of <a href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org</a> that AVR GCC is generating full 32x32 multiplies for 16x16+32 -&gt; 32 MAC so some hand assembly could probably make this go faster.</p>

<p>In order to generate some test cases for our code, I used this <a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/audiocheck_dtmf.php">DTMF WAV file generator</a> and converted the resulting WAV files into virtual ADC samples in the range of our analog circuit.  I then ran our detection code, to verify the algorithm correctness before moving it to the Uno.  A reasonable sample Goertzel implementation can be found <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/design_tip/dm00446805-the-goertzel-algorithm-to-compute-individual-terms-of-the-discrete-fourier-transform-dft-stmicroelectronics.pdf" title="The Goertzel algorithm to compute individual terms of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)">here</a></p>

<h3 id="bell-103">Bell 103</h3>

<p>Programming the gate microcontroller is done via the 300 baud modem protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_103_modem">Bell 103</a>.  The RX side of this seems well within the Uno’s capabilities, as we can likely count the number of zero crossings in every 3ms baud window to discriminate between the mark and space frequencies used by the <a href="http://edge.rit.edu/content/P09141/public/FSK.pdf">FSK</a> encoding.</p>

<p>The TX side however, seems much trickier on the Uno.  The Uno lacks a DAC, and while you can create one using PWM on a digital pin and then put it through a low pass filter, this seemed like a lot of work.  About this time I also wanted to get going on HomeKit portion of the project, and I took the easy way out: using an actual modem.</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/8 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/8">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">an article</a> explaining functors in simple terms and show why they are useful. It has well received, but some felt it was lacking in details which is true and by design. There is more to be said and some crucial details that I glossed over so I will try to address some of them now. Let’s get nerdy!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Functor as a context</h2>
<p>In the previous article I said you could think of a functor as a structure or container that has a mapping function. This is not strictly wrong as it is one way of thinking about the concept, but can be a bit misleading and confusing as it does not fit all situations. For example a functions can in some cases be a functor. A structure might give us thoughts about data structures or types. Container is fitting when talking about lists or other types that can contain data. Is a function a structure or container? For this reason it is common to refer to some of the general concepts and abstractions we use in FP (functor, monad etc.) as contexts which has some properties.</p>
<h2>The functor laws</h2>
<p>Unlike my vague explanation in the previous article a functor is actually a very specific thing, and is defined by rules or properties the context has to adhere to. These laws come from mathematics, specifically a branch called Category Theory. This is an area that I will not claim much knowledge of but great minds have found similarities between this particular part of mathematics and what we do in programming. </p>
<p>In addition to having the <code>map</code> function, functors needs to follow some rules.
The rules for functors are often called the functor laws. I'm not completely sure why. It might have something to do with math and also its sounds very sophisticated. :P Let’s get in on the sophistication!</p>
<h3>1. Law of preservation of identity</h3>
<p>The first law or rule of functors is that if the <code>map</code> function is given the identity function as its mapping function it will return the same functor.
The identity function is just a function that has one argument which it returns right back (<code>\x -&gt; x</code> in Elm or <code>function(x){return x;}</code> in JS).</p>
<p>Let’s use lists to visualize this a bit more. Elm actually has the identity function in its standard library so we will just use that one:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>List.map</span> <span>identity</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the javascript example we will add the identify function inline:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When following this law the functor can not make any weird changes to the result. <code>List.map someFunction [1,2,3,4]</code> can never return an empty list. It can only map the function over the values. When mapping over a 4 item list, the returning list will always be a 4 item list. </p>
<h3>2. Law of composition</h3>
<p>The second law is not very complicated either but assumes that you know about composition. Lets quickly go through composition before looking at the next law.</p>
<h4>Composition</h4>
<p>Composition in functional programming (FP) is the ability to compose multiple functions into one single function. This is not often used in object oriented programming (OOP) but quite common in FP. </p>
<p>Composition is "gluing" functions together into one function. This is such a common thing to do that many languages have dedicated operators for this. Lets look at an example to see it in action to see why this might be useful. I'll be doing the examples in Elm as composition is a bit awkward in javascript and not that common.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a user record that has the fields name and age:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get the age of a User record we can in Elm use an accessor function which is available for every field defined in a record.<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> For the <code>age</code> field this function is called <code>.age</code> and has the type signature <code>User -&gt; Int</code>. It takes a <code>User</code> type as an argument and returns a <code>Int</code>. In this case it is the content of the age field.</p>
<p>Go get the age from a user you would to: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>


<span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At some point in your program you might have a <code>User</code> and need to display the age on a webpage, print it in a log or anything else that needs the age to be a string. To convert a <code>Int</code> into a <code>String</code> we can use the built-in function <code>fromInt</code> in the String module. </p>
<p>So where you have a user and need the age as a string you can use the compose operator in Elm to create a new function that gives you the user age as a string. I will write the type signatures for the functions as well so we can see how they fit together: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>

<span>fromInt</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

<span>ageAsString</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>ageAsString</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fromInt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the output of a function matches the input of another we can compose them together and make a new function that has the input of the first and output of the second. Note that <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the rightwards compose operator.<sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4>The second law</h4>
<p>Now that you hopefully know a bit about function composition lets look at the second law of functors. The rule says that composing functions into a single function and then mapping that function over the functor should produce the same result as mapping the individual functions over the functor in sequence. Lets look as some code to make sense of it:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>User</span>
<span>users</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>[</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Mary"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>22</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Kevin"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>users</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>String.fromInt</span>

<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>=</span> 
	<span>List.map</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>String.fromInt</span><span>)</span> <span>users</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we have a list of users and two constants<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> that both are a list of the users’ ages as strings. </p>
<p>The first constant, <code>agesThroughMaps</code>, is defined using two map operations. The first run passes the <code>.age</code> accessor function to <code>map</code> and gives us a list of ages (of type <code>Int</code>). In the second map operation the <code>String.fromInt</code> is used to create a list of the users’ ages as <code>String</code>. </p>
<p>For the last constant, <code>agesTthroughMaps</code>, the list of the users age is created with one map operation where the function passed in to <code>map</code> is composed of the <code>.age</code> and <code>fromInt</code> functions with the compose operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>). </p>
<p>And this is the result of the second law: the values in the two constants should be equal. A list of strings: <code>["20", "22", "30"]</code></p>
<p>See full example in Ellie: <a href="https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1">https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1</a></p>
<h2>The consequences of the laws</h2>
<p>The laws might seem a bit random and not very helpful at first glance, but it can actually help us a lot. To be a functor the structure/container/context has to follow these laws. It can not do anything weird with the value/values in it or the function that is passed inn. The only thing it can do is apply the function to the value in the context. The functor might have some extra logic around when to apply the function. A list might be empty so there would be nothing to apply the function to and similarly with <code>Maybe</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">last years article</a> to see a more complex example.</p>
<p>With these rules for what constitutes a functor in place the behavior of functors become predictable. So if we see it in code or talk about it with fellow coders we know exactly how it should behave! 😄</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>To make matters worse: the company behind the app were in the middle of a perfect storm. The business was being changed by regulation. The core business idea were changing. This meant large changes coming to the digital side, including the app.</p>
<p>Naturally, we had quite mixed feelings about our ability to meet delivery expectations from the business side, given the bad state of the app codebase. We were at a crossroads, and felt we had to pick one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Negotiate a feature timeout while we frantically renovate the core code, or</li>
<li>Start a long-term migration plan towards a hybrid app, or</li>
<li>Write new features in React Native and eventually move all the JS code over to a new app shell</li>
</ol>
<p>We decided to try out React Native. Roughly three years later, the app is now 100% JavaScript. The big business transformation has come a long way, and I’ve experienced that React Native as a technology has played a key role in that success.</p>
<p>This article contains some reflections on <em>why</em> switching from pure native technologies to React Native worked so well for us.</p>
<h2>Starting Out Small Felt Really Safe</h2>
<p>We gave React Natives two tests. First, we wrote a small feature with a few developers. Futhermore, we did a larger, several-month feature where the entire team participated. A critical part of the tests was making sure that React Native would work as the small cogwheel it would necessarily start out as, inside of the large legacy app monster.</p>
<p>The people involved in each phase would evaluate the React Native developer experience, carefully considering if moving forward with React Native would be the right choice for us. After all, continuing with RN would mean a long migration process. Lots of our features would exist in the old, smelly native code for a long time, we would have to manually ensure backwards compatibility, handle (deep) navigation from old to new code (and vice verca), and lots of other things.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges in mind, the team were crystal clear post-testing. React Native made work easier, faster and more fun! In case we’d conclude differently, the investment made was so low that we could safely discard the effort as a proof-of-concept, where the learnings were enough to justify the time spent.</p>
<p>Trying out new technology this way just seems like a very smart way to do it. It was also key that it was the voice of the developers spending all day with the technology that weighed the most.</p>
<h2>We Actually Did Develop New Features Much Faster</h2>
<p>They say React Native save you half the work. Since your code will run on both iOS and Android, it eliminates the need to develop separate code &nbsp;for each platform. Write code once – not twice. Neat!</p>
<p>In our experience, this was mostly true. We did end up doing minor platform customizations here and there. Shadows don’t work as well on Android as iOS. Sometimes you’d want different UI behaviours to adhere to platform guidelines. And as with web development, you’ll encounter visual bugs for each platform that need special attention.</p>
<p><strong>I’d say we saved about 45% of the work involved.</strong> It’s not half - but it still makes a tremendous difference on productivity!</p>
<p>It’s also hard to not talk about the productivity boost obtained by Hot Reload (now Fast Refresh). Seeing the effect of my last code edit presented visually on screen immediately (with state preserved) is simply marvelous. Scale up the time saved for each little change with the amount of the developers involved and the amount of time spent… it’s just huge!</p>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/fastrefresh.gif" alt="animation showing how react-native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot; works" title="React Native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot;"></p>
<h2>All Developers Code For Both Platforms</h2>
<p>I’ve met hundreds of fine developers, if not thousands. But those skilled and efficient in both native iOS and native Android development - I can count them on one hand. And they’re not exactly looking for work.</p>
<p>With React Native, we experienced that the entire team could do work for both platforms. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this fact. Instead of having dedicated iOS and Android teams, we’d have a feature being made by the same person (or small group) on both platforms, reducing the overhead involved in coordination and organization between devs and designers, business folks, product owners, etc. Also, fewer people needed to learn the ins and outs of that particular feature in a quite complex domain.</p>
<p>This provides great flexibility and robustness for a development team, and was much needed in our setting.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and Onboarding</h2>
<p>Not too many people are familiar with native mobile technologies. In comparison, capable JavaScript/React-developers come a dime a dozen. We found that finding talent was easier, and the newcomers found themselves productive way quicker than we’d expect. In a period with frantic scaling and expansion, this was critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine recruiting top-notch mobile development specialists is easier if you’re a huge company with infinite resources. In that case, you could staff the necessary amount of specialist teams for iOS and Android and just steamroll whatever you’re making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Norwegian market, with finite resources, easing your requirements from <em>«five years of Swift»</em> to <em>«five years of JavaScript experience»</em> makes all the difference. The programming language in itself is one thing, but there’s also the ecosystem, development enviroment, IDE, etc. Apple make a lot of really sweet products, but XCode surely isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2>Team Organization</h2>
<p>Our old codebase was.. entangled. I imagine it would be challenging to attempt doing distributed development on the same codebase across several teams. At least when aiming for near-continuous delivery. Doing a Spotify-like product team organization with an app dev in each team seemed utopian at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few years, we went from a dedicated mobile team of five to a product team organization with near 20 mobile developer spread across all teams. This would be much harder without the flexibility and familiarity of <em>«it’s just JavaScript»</em> or <em>«it´s just React»</em>. Not having to invest as much time and energy in specialist competencies for iOS or Android, app devs have more cognitive surplus to work on other things as well - web, cloud stuff, backend, UX-collaboration, etc.</p>
<h2>Deploy To Production At Will</h2>
<p>Mobile apps have always had a longer way to production. The <em>«quality control»</em> mechanism with manual app reviews adds several days to the pipeline. The Apple App Store was alone responsible for up to a 14-day delay at it’s worst, although the wait times have been vastly reduced since then. Now they’re averaging at about a day.</p>
<p>A good dev team in 2020 will deploy to production many times each day. Looking at some of the biggest Norwegian apps today, it is not uncommon to see two-three-four week old builds as the most recent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The negative effects of not releasing your code often, and not even having the possibility to release at will, are well documented. React Native with it’s <em>over the air</em>-update called <em>CodePush</em> allows for continous delivery, even for mobile apps!&nbsp;</p>
<p>CodePush allows your app code to download the latest version of the compressed JavaScript bundle from a third-party server. When a user opens the app, the new bundle is downloaded and immediately installed. Voilà – immediate deploy to production!</p>
<p>Our app’s release cycle went from semi-monthly to several releases per day. Paired with great monitoring, this reduces the need for testing. Non-critical bugs can be tolerated to a larger degree if they don’t reach your entire audience before they’re automatically detected and shortly fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product development is also way faster. The team can iterate on small changes on real customers in production as a part of the development process, instead of lengthy sketching and laboratory user testing. This made the entire organization more customer-focused and impatient for real customer feedback.</p>
<h2>A Note On The Rewrite</h2>
<p>The whole codebase transformation to React Native took about two years. We only wrote already-planned new features in React Native, allowing us to be productive and produce new features during the process. The business transformation underway meant that most of the features would have required changes anyway, and it could actually be faster to implement them from scratch in React Native than to modify the legacy code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant that we didn’t need a feature-freeze period with the team stuck on unproductive rewrite work. However, when most of the old app was rewritten, we needed a month-long cleanup to move all the separate features in the old app over to a new, fresh React Native repo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From around March 2017 until June 2019 the app was in a state where some features existed in the old codebase and others in the new codebase. That wasn’t a pleasant situation, but not more unpleasant than working in the old legacy codebase before.</p>
<h2>Status As We’re Looming On 2021</h2>
<p>A total of <strong>10,000 commits</strong> have been made by <strong>33 contributors</strong> across <strong>5 teams.</strong>. Nearly 50 pull-requests from 14 authors was merged the past week. Our ability to deliver on business requirements have been strengthened. Looking back on our big choice of 2017, it’s truly awe-inspiring to see how big an effect a simple technology choice can have on helping teams reach lofty goals.</p>
<p>No technology is a silver bullet. React Native surely isn’t either. But it does have some truly wonderful effects on an impatient, agile, modern development organization that Swift, Kotlin or C# currently can’t offer, in my opinion.</p></section></article></div>]]>

December 7, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/8 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/8">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. When a message is encrypted with a secure algorithm, i.e. an encryption cipher, no one should be able to read it without the decryption key. However, the promise of security falls apart if the encryption algorithm is weak, or if someone has created a backdoor. In this article we’ll examine the modern history of encryption. We’ll learn that while the mathematical underpinnings of modern encryption is stronger than ever, government agencies have a history of thwarting efforts to reach the goal of truly secure communication. </p>
</section><article><section><p>The world’s first encryption ciphers often used algorithms that were themselves secret. The rather intuitive belief that security increases if the encryption details are hidden is a misconception, and is often referred to as <em>security by obscurity</em>. The algorithms that dominate the modern era rely on full openness, in accordance with <em>Kerckhoffs's principle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This transparency allows the rest of the world to attempt to break the cipher. Every failed attempt at breaking a cipher reinforces the belief that it is secure. While there is a chance that someone breaks a cipher and does not report it, there is a far greater chance that a homemade algorithm will be broken easily.</p>
<h2>A big moment in cryptographic history</h2>
<p>Up until 1972 there was no standard cipher for encrypting secret messages. The US <em>National Bureau of Standards (NBS)</em>, which later became the <em>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</em>, started an initiative for finding a single secure algorithm. This was rather revolutionary. The American government had traditionally kept their knowledge of cryptography to themselves - they considered it to be crucial to national security. As a result of the NIST initiative, several ciphers were proposed as candidates for the first encryption standard.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate was contributed by a team of cryptographers working at IBM. They developed a refined version of an earlier encryption cipher called Lucifer, which was first developed by Horst Feistel in the late 1960s. Their candidate was a block cipher with a key size of 128 bits. A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts several bits at a time, i.e. a block of bits, as opposed to stream ciphers that encrypts bit by bit. A sufficiently large key size is necessary for a cipher to withstand brute force attacks, since these attacks generate all possible decryption keys. In context of a brute force attack, one would say that the larger the key size the more robust the cipher.</p>
<h2>Speculation of NSA backdoors</h2>
<p>When the NIST examined the security of the cipher candidates, they reached out to the <em>National Security Agency (NSA)</em> for assistance. At this point in time the NSA did not even admit their own existence. The involvement of the NSA lead to speculation and rumors, since the cipher went through a couple of peculiar alterations during the cooperation between NSA and IBM. </p>
<p>The most worrying change was that the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits. This made the cipher considerably less resistant to brute force attacks. Concerns were raised that this change was motivated by the NSA, in order to provide themselves with a backdoor. Maybe their computers were powerful enough to brute force a key size of 56 bits – but not quite powerful enough to brute force a key size of 128 bits? </p>
<p>The cipher was also altered to be resistant to attacks using differential cryptanalysis. That doesn’t sound too bad, but this particular attack was not known to the public until 1990 – almost 20 years later! If the NSA were familiar with an attack the world would need 20 more years to discover, it is not hard to believe that they might be able to brute force a 56 bit key. However, it should be noted that none of these claims have been proven. </p>
<p>In 1977, the NIST presented an altered version of the IBM cipher as the new standard, which they named the <em>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</em>. It became the first modern, public, freely available encryption algorithm. All details regarding DES were made public, which is good practice since it allows researchers to scrutinize the mathematical details. However, the motivation for the design criteria remained secret. The public never learned why the key size was reduced, and this was the main cause for suspicion regarding the involvement of the NSA.</p>
<h2>DES cracked through brute force attack</h2>
<p>DES was initially meant to be the standard cipher for encryption for 10 years; from 1977 to 1987. But no serious weakness was found, and DES went on to reign as the standard algorithm for more than a decade past its due; until 1999.
In the final years of DES, several attempts were made to design and build a machine to brute force it. Building such a machine would cost millions of dollars. It was speculated that only government agencies would have the necessary financial resources to build it, and by this time it was widely believed that the NSA could in fact crack DES.</p>
<p>As the price of hardware fell, the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</em> built the machine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">Deep Crack</a>.
In 1998 Deep Crack was able to brute force DES in 56 hours. This event demonstrated that it was time to select a new standard cipher for encryption.</p>
<p>In 1997, the NIST initiated an open competition to find a new standard encryption cipher. The competition had five finalists:
<a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc688.012/rijndael/rijndael_doc_V2.pdf">Rijndael</a>,
<a href="http://cryptosoft.de/docs/Mars.pdf">Mars</a>,
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.1151&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">RC6</a>,
<a href="http://www.networkdls.com/Articles/serpent.pdf">Serpent</a> and
<a href="http://gazizova.net/pub/Library/ihtik_Library/dvd_(%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BE)%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/rea_2/Schneider%20B.Twofish.A%20128-bit%20block%20cipher.1998.pdf">Twofish</a>.
This time the selection process was completely transparent. In 2001, after three competitive rounds and intense cryptanalysis by the world’s foremost experts, the decision was made. The cipher Rijndael, designed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was declared as the new standard. It was given the name <em>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</em>. This cipher has three possible key sizes: 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. All these key sizes were sufficiently large to withstand brute force attacks.</p>
<p>AES is widely regarded as the most secure encryption cipher invented. It has been battle-tested for decades and is expected to remain the standard cipher for many years to come. So far there are neither any known critical weaknesses, nor suspicion of backdoors.</p>
<h2>Attempts at legalizing government backdoors</h2>
<p>Algorithms have matured to be practically unbreakable, but current legislative measures attempt to undermine the basic purpose of cryptography. There are recurrent proposals for allowing government backdoors. For instance, the recently proposed <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity"><em>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</em></a> aims to force technology companies to implement backdoors. The right to privacy ends when the government institutions deem it useful to their own agenda. If such a law were to pass, the consequences would be immediate and severe. It would grant immense power to the government, and if a key is leaked or stolen, all encrypted communications are out in the open. Lawmakers argue that having a backdoor would help fight crime and terrorism, but this view assumes that criminals play by the rules and communicate through services using government issued encryption. </p>
<p>In the modern era the goal of private digital communication is, from a technological standpoint, a solved problem. It remains to see if future citizens will be able to enjoy digital privacy in their lives. It’s a question of balancing power between the government and the people – and problems of that nature are not solved as elegantly as cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p><em>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, I highly recommend listening to the following episode of the Darknet Diaries podcast: <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/12/">Episode 12 - Crypto Wars</a>.</em></p></section></article></div>]]>

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=OGY3MzFiOWFhZjk2MzY1NmNmZGFmZjBiNDQxNTE0NjRmZDFiOGNmNCxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607675753">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=NmI5NzQxYjQ3Njg4NjJmOTJlZDI1ZDI4MWZlN2I1Y2IzZjI2NjAzYyxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607675753">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

These peptides are small synthetically produced portions of viral sequences. A peptide-based vaccine is not infectious. We have selected these peptides as the basis for our vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The antigen portion of the vaccine can be substituted by other antigens; for example, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD. By appropriate selection of antigens, the intranasal vaccine design described here can also be adapted for use against other viruses, especially respiratory viruses, such as influenza or non-SARS coronaviruses.</li><li><strong>Chitosan nanoparticle delivery</strong>. Chitosan is a form of chitin, which is found in mushrooms and the shells of crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs (seafood allergies are not allergies to chitin). Chitosan acts as both delivery vehicle and immunostimulatory adjuvant.</li><li><strong>Extremely simple and inexpensive preparation</strong> with easily obtained materials.</li><li><strong>Short-term safety. </strong>This type of vaccine has shown excellent safety in animal studies and human clinical trials. The RaDVaC vaccine has been used repeatedly over several months,  by over 100 self-experimenters, with the most extreme complication in some recipients of stuffy noses. </li></ul>



<p>Protocols for the simple and robust production of chitosan nanoparticle vaccines for intranasal delivery have been published for over two decades. Intranasal delivery of chitosan-based vaccines have shown mild side effects and high levels of efficacy of both mucosal and systemic immunity, when delivered in a prime-boost regimen (in both animal models and human trials). </p>

<p>I recently talked to a company growing and selling in-home hydroponic kits to grow crops in an apartment in the city for example, where most people do not have gardens like in suburbia. Given my experience in the startup world as well as in technology, I thought of their idea for some time and realized that there are quite a few business models that they can go towards, as they had the tech but didn't know how to progress it into an actual business.</p>
<p>Here's the list I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the infrastructure (but not the infrastructure itself) with which customers can then do whatever they want
<ul>
<li>Sell access to hydroponics kits (kits) for individuals, restaurants, companies (groups) to grow their own crops, but they have to maintain it themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> - Selling infrastructure with less control over the details but more ease of use for customers
<ul>
<li>Sell access to kits with certain crops already available, and groups can pick what they want to grow, and perhaps customize the crops and crop choice</li>
<li><em>Serverless</em> - Grow crops on demand based on needed capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the product without selling the infrastructure itself to run the product
<ul>
<li>Sell the crops themselves to groups so that they don't need to grow crops themselves</li>
<li>Boutique grocery stores</li>
<li>Delivery of crops on a regular basis</li>
<li>Delivery of meal kits on a regular basis with additional included groceries such as pasta or rice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</strong> - Sell remote access to the product
<ul>
<li>Monitor crops from anywhere with a web app or mobile app. The app could show crop yields, stats, expected time to delivery, expected time to expiration, et cetera</li>
<li>Complementary to the other models, not a replacement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On-premise</strong> - Sell the product to be deployed directly on the property of the customer, and sometimes maintain it for them
<ul>
<li>Grow the crops on the premises of the groups and maintain it for them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Self Service</strong> - Selling the infrastructure itself, not just access to it
<ul>
<li>Sell the kits themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Computing</strong> - Selling where the product usage occurs, oftentimes taking a percentage of every sale
<ul>
<li>Allow other people to grow crops and sell them locally</li>
<li>The crowdsourced Uber/Airbnb model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list came up due to my experience in business and technology, but if I had expertise in other fields, then this list would've been different. Learn from different domains and create analogies between them to think of new ideas and combinations of those ideas.</p>

<p><span>The world has changed and nothing will be the same: Companies all around the world are shifting to remote work, employees have been adopting new work habits for more than 8 months now. So let’s be honest, employees won’t return to the office as before. Remote work is no longer a temporary situation. You have to create your future environment of work right now because it’s the new norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So when companies shift suddenly from a 100% office environment to a home environment, what do they do? They shift all their in person meetings to video meetings! Really?? Some even double down on it to be sure their employees are working!!</span></p>
<p><span>What happened? Zoom fatigue became the new popular hashtag and people were less productive and less engaged. And we are not talking about “Zoom bombing”!</span></p>
<p><span>I think we have to completely reinvent the way of working, communicating, collaborating and learning in this new world and not just duplicate what we do in person in a digital form.</span></p>
<p><strong>I BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS ASYNC VIDEO COMMUNICATION.</strong></p>
<p><span>Async video meetings are all about optimizing your team’s time, and they are a great way to get information in front of people who don’t have availability for a meeting, or who are working remotely across multiple time zones. When you work in the way I do,having time to think on and internalize information before acting is critical.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of coordinating schedules, opt to send a quick async video with key info that your remote colleagues can view during normal work hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronous communication allows people to first absorb and then act on information when they are able to, rather than the moment a piece of information is put in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are my 5 beliefs to embrace this new world&nbsp; :&nbsp;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>1. The remote worker is FREE, completely FREE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Your employees are working remotely, they decide where and when. They are working from their personal environment, so you don’t oversee how they want to manage their time and where they can or want work. You don’t offer them a work environment anymore so you have to admit that you also lost this power.</span></p>
<p><span>If an employee wants to work from 5am and go hiking or kayaking by 2pm, he can do that!! Why not? Trust me, he will be much more productive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about children: When you are working from home, you are sharing the same family space and property. You cannot ask them everyday “Please be quiet, Iwill be on a zoom meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously!! I am sure this generation will hate zoom meetings. They are synonyms to online school and now“mom and dad are not available”! You are physically here but not really here, it’s difficult for our loved ones. We need to take that in consideration and not impose our timing on others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I encourage your people to work the hours that suit them and their lives, in the middle of what is a stressful time for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>I think we need to be more respectful of each other’s time and not interrupt with alive meeting each time we need it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to be more respectful of each others’ home life: We enter each other’s personal space. It’s why weet captures a small portion of your background and you can even blur it.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>2. The remote worker is MORE PRODUCTIVE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>With asynchronous communication you allow yourself – or your employees – to put all energy into what you do each time and have better control over your workload.</span></p>
<p><span>In workplaces where asynchronous collaboration is reinforced and enabled with technology, productivity is higher. People can follow their agenda and complete daily tasks more easily when they are able respond to their colleagues’ requests based on bandwidth or set up time slots throughout the week to prepare feedback for specific projects. Plus, by focusing their attention on one task at a time they have a more detailed look and bring in better results.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>3. Working remotely = HUMAN &amp; EMOTION</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>It’s important to keep a human and emotional connection with our team and clients even if we cannot see them in person. I personally attach great importance to emotional communication where I can see facial expressions, hear a warm voice, and feel others’ mood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot can be lost in translation in writing, including empathy, body and facial language, and often the attention of the reader when it’s a long note.</span></p>
<p><span>Async videos accomplish a number of things that emails or text chat cannot. They create more of a human connection, which makes it easier to understand each other and makes it clear to the recipient that the ideas being shared are well understood. Async meetings are ideal for giving feedback, because empathy comes through much more clearly when you can see face-to-face or hear a warm voice.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll be surprised by the power of emojis in a video or just how a voice tonality can say a lot!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every person is different and some are not comfortable with the camera. For this reason, we offer the capability to&nbsp; record without the camera but we always show a profile picture in all the videos: It’s a good way to keep a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span>And Weet offers the ability to add filters on your webcam to create a fun environment&nbsp; and make your teammates smile 😉</span></p>
<p><span>We also discovered that&nbsp; async video gives a voice to those who are quieter. Contributing to live meetings can often rely on speaking skills of speed and volume, while async videos let people share their thoughts at their own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>While some people prefer reacting spontaneously others need time to think and video recordings accommodate both approaches to produce a clear “leave-behind” that allows everyone to review feedback at their own speed. </span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>4. STOP CHAT &amp; LONG MEETINGS</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Working remotely equals working alone. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to concentrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever found it difficult to concentrate on your daily job duties after being interrupted by an unexpected casual chit-chat about a project your colleague is working on? It’s fine if this happens sometimes because mutual support and camaraderie is a critical part of being a team. But what if it interferes with your productivity?</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid being interrupted and interrupted for just asking a question.&nbsp; Divide your time between working time and communicating time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/"><span>Recent research</span></a><span> has shown that we live in a more collaborative era; We schedule our working day around meetings, Slack conversations and emails with our colleagues and sometimes these events could take up </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload"><span>80% of a full working day</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be detrimental to our performance; Technically we spend more time hopping from one meeting to another or replying to messages than focusing solely and mindfully on our tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I shut down all my notifications and connect only 4 times in the day to check my emails and my weets. What is great is that if someone needs to ask me a question and would need to do it in a live meeting, he can record it and I answer when I am available. You cannot imagine the freedom that it gives me and above all, the time I gain!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why async video meetings are so effective : We talk faster than we type and we retain more information when delivery is via video. Plus people can review recorded videos at their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to make a clarification : I am not saying to cut off all the live meetings (at least 2/3) but for those that are necessary, put 30min max in your agenda settings. It seems sometimes too short but you will see people will accomodate.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><span>2020 has been a challenging year, no doubt. But one thing is clear – the way we have adapted will inform how we work for years to come, empowering us all to do the best work of our lives. Allowing people to work at a time and a pace that suits them is key to this.</span></p>
<p><span>In this new remote world, we can hire anywhere in the globe. Embracing async collaboration allows companies to access a wider range of candidates and freelancers all around the world;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><b>5 tips to embrace async video meetings :&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>1- the most important: Emphasize trust, organization &amp; independence: Evaluate people based on their results, not the number of hours spent online or number of emails.</span></p>
<p><span>2 – Be cool with the video as a media: Not everyone is comfortable with a camera, communicate that it’s ok to cut off the webcam. You are not looking for perfection, just authenticity; Your employees can record their video as they talk in a real conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>3 – Create an async culture mindset: Explain how it works, share the benefits, share some examples and ask top management to begin by creating some enthusiastic video messages and above all, share that in async communication, we don’t wait for an immediate answer.</span></p>
<p><span>4 – Ask your employees and teammates for feedback: Does it work? What are their feelings?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5 – Minimize the number of meetings you have, but don’t blacklist them.&nbsp; The async work communication stack looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><span>80% async video </span></p>
<p><span>15% live video meetings </span></p>
<p><span>5% physical meetings, e.g., annual company or team retreats</span></p>

<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In-App Purchases (IAP) allow you to build customized purchase experiences for your apps. Using our dead-simple JavaScript API you can ask the user to make purchases dynamically based on your own requirements.</p>
<h2>Adding In-App Products</h2>
<p>To enable IAPs in your app, first, you need to define at least one In-App Product for your app,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://www.outpan.com/dev/apps">Developer Dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>Choose the app you would like to enable In-App Purchases for.</li>
<li>From the dashboard page for the selected app, choose <strong>In-App Products</strong>. </li>
<li>Select <strong>New Product</strong> and enter your product's <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>SKU</strong>, and <strong>Price</strong>. Then select <strong>Add Product</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>In-App Purchases in your app</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the Outpan JS library to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.outpan.com/v1/"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the desired point in your application, call the <code>OPRequestPayment</code> function to ask for payment from the user:</p>
<pre><code>OPRequestPayment('SKU-0001', function(resp){
  if(resp.success)
    alert('Payment succeeded.');
  else
    alert('Payment failed.');
});</code></pre>
</li>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>
