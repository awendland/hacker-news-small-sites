			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns
                    ending in <em>-ism, -ization, -izer,</em> -y, or to the
                    complete noun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <br>
                    agony − agonize
                    <br>
                    civilization − civilize
                    <br>
                    appetizer − appetize
                    <br>
                    criticism − criticize
                    <br>
                    canal&nbsp;− canalize
                    <br>
                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are
                    aggrandize­ment/aggrandize, recognition/recognize, and
                    others noted in <em>C.O.D.</em> as `assimilated to verbs in
                    -ize'. Reference should be made to <em>C.O.D.</em> and
                    Collins, <em>Authors' and Printers'
                    Dictionary,</em> if there is any doubt. Some of the more
                    common <em>-ise</em> words <em>follow:</em></p>

<![CDATA[Overriding C++ virtual functions at run time]]>

August 9, 2020 | https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;

                    <p><strong>Knowledge Graphs </strong>are very powerful NLP tools and advanced studies in the field of Knowledge Graphs have created awesome products that are used by milions of people everyday: think of Google, Youtube, Pinterest, they are all very important companies in this field and their knowledge graphs results are spectacular to analyze and use.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565449446922-702749bcaf1b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="A White Library In The Middle Of Stuttgart!

But the thing is, the more spectacular knowledge graphs are, the more difficult they are to build. You actually need more than one way of building a feature like this: think of triples, relationships, integrating with other data sources and so on. </p><p>In this article I'm going to talk about a small subset of knowledge graph relationships: <em>type-of relationships </em>or <em>is-a relationships</em>, meaning we will try to build a small knowledge graph using Python, SpaCy and NLTK. The knowledge graph will tell us if a certain object is a subclass (a type) of another object. </p><blockquote><em>Interested in more? Follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/b_dmarius">@b_dmarius</a> and I'll post there every new article.</em></blockquote><p>As usual on this blog, I will go through a little bit of theory, then code presentation and explanations and in the end results analysis. Feel free to skip to whichever section you feel is relevant for you. Also, all the code for this article i<a href="https://github.com/bdmarius/python-knowledge-graph-semantic-relationships">s uploaded on Github</a> so you can check it out (please make sure to star the repository as it helps me know the code I write is helpful in any way). We will go through all the code anyways.</p><h3 id="article-overview">Article Overview</h3><ul><li>What is Information Extraction</li><li>What is a Knowledge Graph</li><li>Knowledge Graph applications</li><li>Semantic relationships: hypernyms and hyponyms</li><li>Python Knowledge Graph project overview and setup</li><li>Python Knowledge Graph implementation using Python and SpaCy</li><li>Conclusions</li><li>Related articles</li><li>References</li></ul><p><strong>Information Extraction </strong>is one of the most important fields of Natural Language Processing tasks and it consists of techniques of extracting structured information from unstructured text. </p><p>There is a lot of information out there stored in plain text that we as humans are able to understand in a blink, but computers have lots of troubles with this task because they don't understand text, language and context. </p><p>So in information extraction tasks we try to process textual information and transform it in a way that computers are able to understand and use. For this we need to use various NLP tasks like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-building-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-part-1-named-entity-recognition/">Named Entity Recognition</a>: the task of understanding where and how entities such as people, organisations, events and so on are mentioned in a text</li><li>Named Entity Linking: understand how 2 or more entities are related to each other</li><li><a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-part-2-python-keywords-extraction/">Keywords extraction</a>: Extracting the most relevant words from a text. This can be done using <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/automated-python-keywords-extraction-textrank-vs-rake/">multiple algorithms</a></li><li>Relations extraction using triples</li><li>Knowledge Graphs</li></ul><p>A knowledge graph is a particular representation of data and data relationships which is used to model which entities and concepts are present in a text corpus and how these entities relate to each other. </p><p>The concept of Knowledge Graphs borrows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>. In this particular representation we store data as:</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graphs---Knowledge-Graph-example.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Knowledge Graph Relationship"><figcaption>Knowledge Graph relationship</figcaption></figure><p>Entity 1 and Entity 2 are called nodes and the Relationship is called an edge. Of course, in a real world knowledge graph there are lots of entities and relationships and there is more than one way to arrive at one entity starting from another. </p><p>Usually these type of graphs are modeled with <strong>triples</strong>, which are sets of three items like (subject, verb, object), with the verb being the relationship between the subject and the object - for example (London, is_capital, England).</p><p>In this article we are focusing on only one particular type of relationship, the "is-a" relationship. If we replace this in the image above we read it as "Entity 1 is a type of Entity 2", meaning Entity 2 is the broader type and Entity 1 is the narrower type - for example (Londin, is_a, City).</p><p>Knowledge Graphs have broad applications, out of which some have not even been succesfully built yet. If you need to better understand your data and the relationships between your data points, a knowledge graph is the way to go. But there are some particulary famous examples of uses of knowledge graphs used in real world use cases:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a> is particulary because they have made this term so popular in the latest years. They use knowledge graphs to enhance search results using some additional information that has been gathered from lots of sources on the internet. They also use it for the Instant Answers feature, where you get an info box answering a question you put in the Google search bar (try for example "Who is the godfather of Harry Potter?"</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/interest-taxonomy-a-knowledge-graph-management-system-for-content-understanding-at-pinterest-a6ae75c203fd">Pinterest is using knowledge graphs</a> to model interests of users on the platform. The Pinterest engineering blog is one of my favourites, feel free to read some of their posts.</li><li>Youtube is also using Knowledge Graph to understand what's behind a video and to recommend the videos to users (thus helping them solve the cold-start problem of their collaborative filtering algorithm).</li></ul><p>So we said we are going to use Python and SpaCy to build a knowledge graph containing "is-a" relationships. But before that (and I promise this is the last introductory section) we need to look into some theoretical aspects. </p><p>In more fancy linguistics terms, "is-a" relationships are named <strong>Hypernymy</strong> and <strong>Hyponymy </strong>relationships. So for example, if we say "Harry Potter is a book character", then "Harry Potter" is the hyponym (the narrow entity) of the relationship, while "book character" is the hypernym (the broad entity) of the relationship. </p><p>And because we are using only plain text to extract such information, we need to look at the structure of the sentences, take a look at what Part Of Speech each word represents and try to figure out relationships from there. That's why we say that we are analyzing <strong>semantic relationships</strong>.</p><p>Now, there are many techniques we can use to extract relationships from text: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised techniques are rule-based techniques. And in this article we are going to take advantage of the fact that English is a well-structured language, so we can go with the rule-based techniques.</p><p>There has been a lot of research in this area but a popular piece of research is done by Marti Hearst [1] the results from this research are popularly known as the Hearst Patterns. She has identified a few patterns that can be used in English to extract hypernyms and hyponyms. In the following table hyponyms are represented by <em>h </em>and hypernyms by <em>H</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Hearst-Patterns.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Hearst Patterns"><figcaption>Hearst Patterns</figcaption></figure><p>We are going to use these patterns to try and figure out is-a relationships from plain text extracted from Wikipedia. It's now time to switch to the real action.</p><p>We are going to extract the text from 4 Wikipedia articles about 2 different subjects: London, Paris, WWI and WWII. We are going to use the Hearst Patterns to extract relationships from these 4 articles and add them to a graph. Then are going to display the graph and analyze of results. First let's install some dependencies.</p><pre><code>pip3 install spacy
pip3 install wikipedia
pip3 install nltk
pip3 install networkx
pip3 install matplotlib</code></pre><p>SpaCy is used for text processing, wikipedia is used for extracting the data. We are using NLTK just for a visualization of the relationships between words in a sentence. Networkx is used for building the graph and matplotlib is used for visualization.</p><p>Another command you should run in your terminal (especially if it's the first time you are using spaCy or if you are using a virtual environment is</p><pre><code>python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</code></pre><p>This is used to download the spaCy pre-trained model for English that we are going to use in this project. This the the small model and another, larger one is available (en_core_web_lg) but that is not necessary for this project.</p><p>Let's take a quick peek at our project file structure.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/08/Python-Knowledge-Graph---Project-file-structure.png" alt="Python Knowledge Graph - Project file structure"><figcaption>Project file structure</figcaption></figure><p>There are quite a lot of file, but we are going to go through each other one by one and I'll provide simple explanations.</p><p>First let's get this out of our way: the <em>utils.py</em> file contains a small utility function that I've added to visualize the structure of a sentence. It uses the NLTK Tree and it is inspired by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39104235">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p><pre><code>from nltk import Tree

def buildTree(token):
    if token.n_lefts + token.n_rights &gt; 0:
        return Tree(token, [buildTree(child) for child in token.children])
    else:
        return buildTree(token)</code></pre><p>We are going to store relations in a <em>Relation </em>object and the code for this class is self-explanatory and located in <em>relation.py</em>.</p><pre><code>class Relation:

    __hypernym: str
    __hyponym: str

    def __init__(self, hypernym, hyponym):
        self.__hypernym = hypernym
        self.__hyponym = hyponym

    def getHypernym(self):
        return self.__hypernym

    def getHyponym(self):
        return self.__hyponym

</code></pre><p>I've also written another class to store all relations. The class is stored in <em>relation_provider.py</em> and, again, it is fairly simple.</p><pre><code>from relation import Relation

class RelationProvider:

    __relations: [Relation]

    def __init__(self, relations=[Relation]):
        self.__relations = relations

    def getRelations(self):
        return self.__relations
</code></pre><p>The first step is to extract the text from Wikipedia. We are using the <em>wikipedia </em>package to get that, and this functionality is found in <em>text_extractor.py</em>. We are first downloading the data and storing it in a local file. To get the text, we are reading that file and returing the entire text.</p><pre><code>import wikipedia


class TextExtractor:

    __pageTitle: str
    __pageId: str

    def __init__(self, pageTitle, pageId):
        self.__pageTitle = pageTitle
        self.__pageId = pageId

    def extract(self):
        page = wikipedia.page(title=self.__pageTitle, pageid=self.__pageId)
        f = open("./text/" + self.__pageTitle + …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div></div>

We will be using <b>Navigator.mediaDevices</b> which provides access to connected media input<br>
devices like cameras and microphones, as well as screen sharing.<br>

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init)</p></code>
<br>
So here, firstly init function is called as we have set an event listener for the 'DOMContentLoaded' event. Which check if browser support mediaDevices or not also we had store required element references.</p><p>

The <b>onCapture</b> method will ask permission for the camera to the user<br>
and once permission is given by the user will set stream to video elements in HTML.</p><p>

In <b>onScreenshot</b> method we have use canvas.toDataURL() which returns a data URI containing a representation of the image in the format specified by the type parameter (defaults to PNG).<br>
The returned image is in a resolution of 96 dpi. So this method sets the captured image to UI.</p><p>

In <b>onDownload</b> method we are just doing the download part as we are already storing data URL in <b>onScreenshot</b> method.</p><p>

That's it no external dependency required.</p><p>

August 8, 2020 | https://shankarganesh.blog/2020/03/31/business-software-is-so-good-now-that-its-competing-with-consumer-software/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://shankarganesh.blog/2020/03/31/business-software-is-so-good-now-that-its-competing-with-consumer-software/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<p>My notes from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs520/">CS520 - Knowledge Graph Seminar</a></p>
<h2 id="session-1---what-is-knowledge-graph">Session 1 - What is Knowledge Graph?</h2>
<p><em>Speakers: Denny Vrandečić, Jans Aasman, Mikhail Galkin</em></p>
<p><strong>Denny</strong></p>
<p>Denny speaks about knowledge graphs (KGs) are used for web search, question answer systems, data integration systems.</p>
<p>Specific use case of Wiki Data</p>
<ul>
<li>KG built on 80M nodes, 1B edges</li>
<li>Uses RDF open format (w3c)</li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> annotation</li>
<li>SPARQL for querying</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the open format has great advantages. One example stated was how wikipedia can leverage other services which expose data. Wikipedia can run SPARQL to query OpenStreet Maps data - pick lat, long from OSM for ATMs in Munich for a specific bank network.</p>
<p><strong>Jans</strong></p>
<p>Discussion around modern KGs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic graph DB</li>
<li>Ontologies &amp; Taxonomies</li>
<li>Rule based processing</li>
<li>ML &amp; NLP based processing</li>
</ul>
<p>AllegroGraph's KG implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Document / NLP - Chomsky KG</p>
<p>The Noam Chomsky Knowledge Graph will link to over 1,000 articles &amp; over 100 books that Chomsky has authored about linguistics, mass media, politics &amp; war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Based for Motefiore Health Care</p>
<p>Montefiore’s Patient-centered Analytical Learning Machine (PALM), a machine learning platform built from the ground up to predict &amp; prevent life-threatening medical conditions &amp; minimize wait times.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mikhail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of KG as world models in terms of entities &amp; relations</li>
<li>Encoding can be based on different representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Representations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Symbolic - Logic, DB</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Store as triples</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">Subject-Predicate-Object

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector - NLP, Computer Vision</p>
<ul>
<li>Embeddings - Leverage high dimensional space &amp; a function to group similar things nearby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>KGs can be viewed from different Point of Views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logic programming, RDF way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDMS - entities are cells, relations are columns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Vision - CNN + RPN ⇒ graph inference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NLP</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge Graph ⇒ Named Entity Recognition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Retrieval ⇒ Relation Linking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unstructured Sources ⇒ Question Answer System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language Models</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Sources are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unstructured text articles</li>
<li>Semi structured</li>
<li>Structured features</li>
<li>Human Curated</li>
</ol>
<p>All these are fused together to build the Siri KG. Techniques used - Info Box extraction from wikipedia, Entity Resolution.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fields do not match</p>
<p>Date of Birth, DoB, Birth Date - all of them mean the same</p>
</li>
</ul>

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger. Ninety-nine per cent of respondents to a Gallup Inc. survey in Niger said religion was an important part of daily life.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Tientan Ling/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"I was a little surprised&nbsp;… how strongly it correlated with income, but it definitely corresponds to other research that has shown that societies tend to grow more secular as they modernize and as living standards improve," said Steve Crabtree, a research analyst with Gallup Inc. (a separate entity from WIN-Gallup International).</p>  <p>(The Gallup and the WIN-Gallup International polls have a margin of error of around +/- 3 to 5 per cent.)</p>  <h3>Most vulnerable are often most religious</h3>  <p>Sociologists have argued that the social benefits of religion take on greater importance, the fewer resources and the less&nbsp;control people have over their own lives.</p>    <p>"Religion becomes less central as people's lives become less vulnerable to the constant threat of death, disease and misfortune," Norris and Inglehart write in their 2004 book, <em>Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide</em>.</p>  <div>   <h2>Income gap</h2>   <p>The <a href="http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf">2012 WIN-Gallup International Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism</a>&nbsp;found that in the countries surveyed, respondents in the lowest income bracket were on average 17 per cent more religious than those in the highest.</p>   <p>In Canada, 44 per of those who earn between $20,000 and $29,999 say they practice their religious or spiritual beliefs at least once a week, compared to 32 per cent in the $80,000-$99,999 income bracket, according to the Statistics Canada General Social Survey in 2011.</p>   <p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/114211/alabamians-iranians-common.aspx">Gallup Inc. poll</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. found that the poorest states&nbsp;in the country, such as Mississippi and Alabama, were the most religious and&nbsp;compared with&nbsp;countries like Iran, Lebanon and Zimbabwe in terms of the importance given to religion. Wealthier states like Vermont and Maine were more comparable to Switzerland and Canada, the poll found.</p>  </div>  <p>"As lives gradually become more comfortable and secure, people in more affluent societies usually grow increasingly indifferent to religious values, more skeptical of supernatural beliefs and less willing to become actively engaged in religious institutions."</p>  <p>In poor countries, religious institutions often provide essential services such as education and health care, and the social networks that faith communities provide can be crucial in times of crisis.</p>    <p>"In the richer countries, people are less likely to face existential threats … so they have more opportunity for fulfillment outside of religion," Crabtree said.</p>  <p>But it's more than just an accumulation of wealth that makes a country more secular, sociologists say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The United States is one of the wealthier societies, and yet, it's still quite religious," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who has studied secularization in Scandinavian countries and wrote a book about it called <em>Society Without God</em>.</p>  <p>"I think it's when you have what we might call 'existential security'&nbsp;— so, wealth and prosperity are part of that, but by that we [also] mean the bulk of people in society have access to housing, health care, jobs. They live in a relatively stable, democratic society without much in the way of existential threats to their lives or their culture."</p>  <p>It's no accident, say some sociologists, that some of the world's least religious people live in nations …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-08: Where do argc and argv come from?</h2>
<p>Continuing on from <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200803.html">our tiny snake game</a>, let's explore more into how binaries work on Unix. Let's figure out how our programs come to obtain their argc and argv parameters.</p>
<p>You can grab the finished code for this write-up <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo">here on GitHub</a>.
</p><h4>The past: a no option world</h4>
<p>One thing we exploited with our snake game was the fact that it took no options. That was an easy way to keep the binary size down. If the user did happen to write things on the command line after the command invocation, our game would simply ignore it. Such behavior can be explained in the code that invokes the main function.</p>
<pre>main(void)
</pre>
<p>Our main function takes no arguments. But that's not the norm for Unix programs. It is more common that we see our main function take two parameters.</p>
<pre>main(int argc, char *argv[])
</pre>
<p>An integer telling us the number of arguments and a double pointer which gives us those arguments. But how does our program get those arguments? If we type them out on the command line, what is the mechanism that passes things to our program? Let's write a program that takes command line options. It doesn't have to do anything special. Just reading them in and printing them out would work for us. This is effectively the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/echo.1">echo(1)</a> utility we will recreate, though we will leave out the <code>-n</code> flag.</p>
<h4>Setting up our environment</h4>
<p>Let's copy over our <a href="https://github.com/ibara/snakeqr/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s file</a> from SnakeQR. Let's also split it up into three files: the .note.openbsd.ident section will remain in <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/crt.s">crt.s</a>, _start will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_start.s">_start.s</a> file and _syscall will go into a new <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/_syscall.s">_syscall.s</a> file. Let's write a simple <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> too while we're here. We will put our C code into an <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.c">echo.c</a> file.</p>
<p>We are also going to improve our _start function. As we remember from SnakeQR, the equivalent C for our _start function is</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{

	main();

	_exit(0);
}
</pre>
<p>But we Unix people know that main is an int and can return different values. And we can use those values in other places (like shell scripts). Our current _start function doesn't cut it. We need something more like</p>
<pre>void
_start(void)
{
	int argc;
	char **argv;

	_exit(main(argc, argv));
}
</pre>
<p>In assembly, that looks something like</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>Really similar to our previous version of _start but this time instead of clearing %edi we instead take the value of %eax after main exits and put it in %edi, which is the parameter for _exit. Why %eax? Because the return value of functions are put in %eax. We have to remember to move the return value to %edi right away because we need %eax again to provide the syscall number as we learned from SnakeQR. You'll notice that we don't handle argc or argv mostly because we don't know yet how to handle them. And maybe we don't have to. With this, we can write a very simple main function that returns the value of argc.</p>
<h4>Is it really that easy?</h4>
<p>Maybe it really is this easy; let's write that simple main function.</p>
<pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	return argc;
}
</pre>
<p>If we run <code>echo one two three</code> we should get a return value of 4. Remember that the program name ends up counting in argc and lives in argv[0]. Run it, issue echo $? after and... 0. So no, it wasn't that easy. It was worth a shot.</p>
<p>But we know that argc and argv have to come from <i>somewhere</i> and if it's somewhere, chances are good it will show up in gdb. I'll be using <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/devel/gdb">egdb (aka gdb from ports)</a> since that's newer than the gdb in base. We can install it with a simple <code>doas pkg_add gdb</code>.
</p><h4>Running our program in gdb</h4>
<p>If you've never used gdb before, there are a lot of things you can do with it. But let's keep things simple. We can load our program into gdb like so</p>
<pre>$ egdb --args ./echo
</pre>
<p>This will allow us to put any number of command line options, though we're not using any right now. Our argc should be 1 so let's see if we can find a 1 somewhere in gdb.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do in gdb is run the program. At the (gdb) prompt, type <code>r</code> and press Enter.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo
/home/brian/echo/echo
[Inferior 1 (process 38559) exited normally]
</pre>
<p>That wasn't very interesting. It ran and exited without telling us anything.</p>
<h4>Breaking our program</h4>
<p>In order to do anything meaningful we should insert breakpoints. This tells gdb to pause execution at that memory location. All our functions can be used as locations to break. We can also break at offsets from our functions, but we don't need that functionality for today.</p>
<p>We only have two functions so far: _start and main. My hunch tells me that because _start is our entry point, if our hosted environment is giving us argc and argv, it will definitely be findable in _start, whereas we might lose it by the time we get to main. Let's set a breakpoint at _start.</p>
<pre>(gdb) b _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0x201170
</pre>
<p>OK. We're ready to go. Let's run the program now.</p>
<pre>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/brian/echo/echo

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000201170 in _start ()
</pre>
<p>We are effectively at the point where our hosted environment hands off execution to the program. Now we can explore our program.</p>
<h4>Getting information</h4>
We can tell gdb to give us the contents of all our registers with the <code>info reg</code> command.
<pre>(gdb) info reg
rax            0x0      0
rbx            0x0      0
rcx            0x0      0
rdx            0x0      0
rsi            0x0      0
rdi            0x0      0
rbp            0x0      0x0
rsp            0x7f7ffffbe6e0   0x7f7ffffbe6e0
r8             0x0      0
r9             0x0      0
r10            0x0      0
r11            0x0      0
r12            0x0      0
r13            0x0      0
r14            0x0      0
r15            0x0      0
rip            0x201170 0x201170 &lt;_start&gt;
eflags         0x202    [ IF ]
cs             0x2b     43
ss             0x23     35
ds             0x23     35
es             0x23     35
fs             0x23     35
gs             0x23     35
</pre>
<p>We know that argc is going to be 1, so any register that is 0 we can ignore. Not what we're looking for. The %rip register holds our instruction pointer, and gdb helpfully tells us that memory location corresponds to the _start function. The eflags register is our status register, which contains information like the carry bit and the zero bit. We can't use that directly. And cs through gs are segment registers, which we are not going to look at today. That leaves us with %rsp as our candidate. It certainly holds something. It happens to be a location on the stack (%rsp = stack pointer). We can examine it with the <code>x/x $rsp</code> command. This is the x command. For us, we will use it in the form x/&lt;length&gt;&lt;format&gt;, where length is the number of format objects we want (if you leave it out, you want one) and format is our format specifier. An x for the format specifier means hexadecimal but there are others too, like f for floating point, i for instruction, and s for string.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffbe6e0: 0x00000001
</pre>
<p>Hey! That's a 1! Let's quit out of gdb and rerun it as <code>egdb --args ./echo one</code> and see if we get a 2 next time.</p>
<pre>(gdb) x/x $rsp
0x7f7ffffcb900: 0x00000002
</pre>
We do!
<h4>Passing argc from our hosted environment to our program</h4>
<p>I think we've discovered that our hosted environment puts argc and argv on the stack and then jumps to _start so that _start also has access to argc and argv. Let's think back to our calling convention: the first argument goes in %rdi. We should be able to pop the top value off the stack and put it in %rdi and then our main function will return argc. Let's add this to _start.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>All we did was add <code>popq %rdi</code> before the main call. Let's recompile and see what happens.</p>
<pre>/home/brian/echo $ ./echo        
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?       
1
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?    
2
/home/brian/echo $ ./echo one two
/home/brian/echo $ echo $?        
3
</pre>
<p>I think we can say we are successfully passing argc from our hosted environment to our program.</p>
<h4>Passing argv to our program, part 1</h4>
<p>Now we need to find and pass argv. Maybe it's as simple as the current top of the stack, now that argc has been popped off, is argv. Remember that %rsi is the second parameter according to our calling convention. If it's really that easy all we will need to do is add <code>movq %rsp, %rsi</code> after the <code>popq %rdi</code> we just added.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	_start
_start:
	popq	%rdi
	movq	%rsp, %rsi
	callq	main
	movl	%eax, %edi
	movl	$1, %eax
	syscall
	.size	_start,.-_start
</pre>
<p>We should also write a proper echo function in C while we are here. The usual way it goes is skip argv[0], from argv[1] to argv[argc - 1], print the argument and if there is a next argument also print a space. Once we run out of arguments, print a newline. In C, this looks like
</p><pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i;

	for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
		write(1, argv[i], strlen(argv[i]));
		if (i + 1 != argc)
			write(1, " ", 1);
	}
	write(1, "\n", 1);

	return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>strlen</h4>
<p>We don't actually know how long each argument will be, so we need some way to calculate that since our write function requires us to pass the number of characters to write as an argument. The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/strlen.3">strlen(3)</a> function does that for us. But remember since we're building everything ourselves, let's take a moment to think about what strlen does and how we can recreate it.</p>
<p>The strlen function reads in a string and outputs the number of characters in that string. We can set up a second pointer that points to the first character of the string. Since we know strings in C must end with a NUL byte, we can check to see if our second pointer is the NUL byte and if not move to the next character of the string. When we hit the NUL byte, subtracting the original string location from the second string location will give us the length of the string. We can't …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Since around 2015, I’ve been <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-pays/">dollar-cost averaging</a>
cryptocurrencies over at Coinbase. “Stacking Sats,” it’s called these days.</p>
<p>Coinbase makes it very straightforward: link your bank account, pick your currency and frequency of purchase, <em>et voila:</em> your USD becomes cryptocurrency. For a fee, of course.</p>
<p>Anybody who has been around Cryptocurrency for more than a couple minutes knows that prices tend to fluctuate wildly.
On the whole, however, prices have been trending up.
As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is:</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Last 6 months, +194.86%</li>
    <li>Last 2 years, +266.49%</li>
    <li>Last 3 years, +290.18%</li>
    <li>Last 5 years, +5,300.92%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Price information derived from <a href="https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/performance">barchart</a>
  </p>
</div>
<p>With a significant general upward trend like this, monthly cost averaging means you’re leaving a lot of BTC on the table compared with weekly or daily cost average investing.
I decided that daily dollar cost averaging was in my best interest, so I set up a recurring purchase for $10 per day, and ate the $1 service charge. What’s $30/mo when you’ve got compounding double-digit gains on $270/mo?</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra money on the table!
Thinking about this in terms of USD is the wrong approach; the amount of USD I’m spending is fixed.
The correct way to think about this is: how much more BTC would I have if I were not paying Coinbase a 10% fee?</p>
<p>To be clear, Coinbase’s fee is a much smaller percentage if you’re investing a larger sum of money.
Investing a larger sum would mean more time between purchases, which (for reasons described above) I want to avoid.</p>
<p>One solution is to use <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a> instead of <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>.
The <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/fees">trading fees</a> on Coinbase Pro are <em>significantly</em> less — at the volume I’m trading, they’re 0.5% instead of 10%: a whole 9.5% less.</p>
<p>Switching to Coinbase Pro, in other words, earns me 10.5% more BTC per transaction when compared with Coinbase’s “Recurring Buys” offering.
The problem? Coinbase Pro does not offer recurring buys! They <em>do,</em> however, offer an API that we can use to initiate recurring buys on our own.</p>
<h2>Enter Rust</h2>
<p>Call me paranoid, but I am not about to put API keys that can access my personal Coinbase account on servers that I don’t physically control. This means running servers at home, which means electricity costs and heat.</p>
<p>The electricity and heat problems associated with running servers at home can be mitigated by using hardware like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> — a credit-card sized computer that draws around 5W of power, and doesn’t put out enough heat to even require fans. The downsides include limited processing power, and downright atrocious disk IO (if using the built-in SD card reader).</p>
<p>The Pi’s performance limitations mean that I want software running on it to be small and fast.
Furthermore, because I’m dealing with money and network-based APIs, it’s also important that the software I’m using is <em>correct.</em></p>
<p>The Rust Programming Language checks all of these boxes — with performance on par with C and C++, and a compiler that requires you to account for failure cases and not just happy paths, it becomes difficult to write incorrect code.
Furthermore, Rust makes it easy to compile to multiple targets, which means getting it onto an ARM processor (the Pi) is not a significant undertaking.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to Github’s new pricing strategy around Github Actions (free!), we can just let Github compile all the binaries for us! 😁</p>
<h2>The Strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of relying on Coinbase to purchase BTC for us, we’ll write a Rust program to do it instead.
Nothing fancy needed here — no price watching or machine learning to optimize purchase times, just a Rust binary that starts instantly, makes a transaction, logs the output, and exits. Stick it on the crontab and call it good!</p>
<p>The program I ended up with, <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/">hodl</a>, has been running faithfully for the past two months! It’s my first Rust program, so please be kind and help me learn 😊.</p>
<p>Since I began “stacking sats” this way, I’ve only run into one issue: after losing power in a storm, we came back online with a new IP address, and the new address was not yet associated with my API key, so <code>hodl</code> failed to make a couple purchases (this is a security feature that you can elect to disable).
I noticed something was afoot after I stopped receiving my nightly confirmation emails, so I logged onto the Pi, checked the logs, saw the issue, added the new IP address, and we were back in business.</p>
<h2>Setting it up</h2>
<p>Everyone is going to have different API keys, and I’m not about to check mine into the repository :)
In order to use hodl, you need to set some environment variables.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be to create a script, <code>hodl</code>, that sets these and invokes <a href="https://github.com/ajpierce/hodl/releases">the hodl binary you download</a>:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your key<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_SECRET</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your secret<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>COINBASE_API_PASSPHRASE</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>your passphrase<span>]</span>
<span>export</span> <span>BANK_ID</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>id of your associated bank account<span>]</span>

./hodl-ARMv7 <span>$@</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, you can set your crontab to run periodic deposit and buy commands. For example,</p>
<div data-language="cron"><pre><code># m h  dom mon dow   command
0   0   */3  *   *   /home/pi/hodl deposit 45 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
7   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy BTC 10 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log
8   0   *    *   *   /home/pi/hodl buy ETH 5 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a /home/pi/logs/hodl.log</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Et voila,</em> cryptocurrency dollar cost averaging at a fraction of the retail cost!</p>
<p>The crontab above will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deposit $45 USD into Coinbase every 3 days (every 72 hours)</li>
<li>Buy $10 USD worth of BTC every day at 7 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Buy $5 USD worth of ETH every day at 8 minutes past midnight</li>
<li>Send both standard error and standard output to a log file</li>
</ol>
<p>The times I picked were arbitrary; some time spent with historical data and in a Jupyter notebook revealed that there wasn’t a reliable correlation with time of day and low (relative to a sliding window) prices, so pick a time that’s convenient for you!</p>
<h2>Thoughts on Rust</h2>
<p>Overall, I’ve walked away with a positive impression of Rust.
I especially like the <code>match</code> structure, though it took me a while to get comfortable with the difference between <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types.
Figuring out how to cryptographically sign API request headers to accommodate the Coinbase Pro API was a fun challenge that forced me to get into the docs of other Crates, and (coming from the dynamically typed world of JavaScript and Clojure) suffer a bit of pain for the type system, though I am grateful that it keeps me honest.
I also like the stance Rust takes towards data organization with Structs, which I feel are a much better alternative to the OO purgatory I found myself in back when worked in Java. When it comes to data, though, I still feel like Clojure has it figured out the best.</p>
<p>For this job, Rust was excellent, and I believe in picking the right tool for the job.
Not that other tools wouldn’t have done the job just as nicely, but I was looking for an excuse to learn something, and this solved a real problem that is making me more money as a result.
Just in time, too: since I started using <code>hodl</code> instead of Coinbase, the price of BTC has gone up over 30%!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<h2 id="environment-variables-for-single-page-apps-spas">Environment Variables for Single Page Apps (SPAs)</h2>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Have you ever built a SPA, and found yourself frustrated at having to build specifically for the target environment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“oh dang, this container won’t run in staging because it has localhost:1337 for the back-end API endpoint, whut do?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously you don’t want to pass secrets, but having to build a container per environment for config items is a PITA.</p>
<p>Fear not, answer below.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In the container entrypoint, use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envsubst</a> to push env vars into a template file and serve as a JS file.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables-env-vars">Environment variables (env vars)</h2>
<p>Environment variables are variables which are present in the current environment, duh. For example a container, or a Linux/Windows server, or your local machine.</p>
<p>Once set, they can be read by a program running in that environment. In Go you can do <code>myEnvVar = os.Getenv("MY_ENV_VAR")</code> to read the MY_ENV_VAR env var into a variable in your program.</p>
<p>Docker Compose provides a nice way to pass these from the yaml files which define services:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>my-service:
    environment:
        - MY_ENV_VAR=a-string-value-m9
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When the compose file is used to run the services (containers) it defines, the variable <code>myEnvVar</code> in the Go example would be set to “a-string-value-m9”.</p>
<p>This is really useful, as now the same code can be run, but have things like URLs, DB host names etc. passed in to suit the environment.</p>
<h2 id="when-are-you-going-to-talk-about-spas-though">When are you going to talk about SPAs though?</h2>
<p>I know that the above is most likely familiar, but it gets a bit tricker when you try reading env vars in a statically compiled web app. This is where the docker + envsubst magic comes in.</p>
<p>As a container starts up, a command is run - normally in this context, to run a webserver like Nginx - to serve the static content. At this point we use envsubst to read our template file, squirt in the env vars, and then call the oringinal entry point command - start ya webserver.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-what-you-mean">Show me what you mean…</h2>
<p>From the Dockerfile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>CMD ["sh", "-c", "envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js &gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js &amp;&amp; nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our config template is read from a non-web-accessible directory above the web root (keep things clean), has the env vars injected by envsubst (<code>envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js</code>), and the result is output (<code>&gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js</code>) into the web root of the static web app.</p>
<p>^^^ that, is the magic!</p>
<h2 id="the-web-bit">The web bit</h2>
<p>The template file I use looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>window.myexampleapp = {
	env: {
		API_URL: "$API_URL",
	},
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is simply chucking us a configuration object onto window.</p>
<p>As long as we include env-config.js in our html <code>&lt;script src="/env-config.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> before our application JS, we can be sure that our env vars will be available for use.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>this.apiUrl = window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			? window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			: "http://localhost:1337";
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Read the values in our application as above.</p>
<h2 id="let-us-recap">Let us recap</h2>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the env var (in the docker-compose file, or in a docker run command)</li>
<li>modified container entrypoint to spin up our container with envsubst + run our webserver start command</li>
<li>dropped a file in our container webroot with the env vars injected and added to window</li>
<li>added that file to our html via a script tag</li>
<li>read the env vars from window in our JS</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey presto - your container will now ingest those juicy env vars, and make them accessible to your static front-end application!</p>
<p>One of the huge benefits here is that a single container can be re-used across all environments - giving a higher level of confidence that any testing done has been on that specific piece of built code. Oh, and saving on the number of env specific containers, allowing for easier caching of images for deployments etc.</p>
<p>It also makes for riveting pub chat with your non-technical buddies.</p>
<h2 id="gimme-a-full-example-then-pal">Gimme a full example then pal</h2>
<p>It’ll be up on GitHub soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading - technical and other feedback very welcome, hope this is as helpful for you as it has been for me!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>A wise man once told me that inexperienced engineers tend to undervalue simplicity. Since I’m not wise myself, I don’t know whether this is true, but the ideas which show up in many different contexts do seem to be very simple. This post is about two of the most widely used ideas in deep learning, the mean squared error loss and the cross entropy loss, and how in a certain sense they’re the simplest possible approaches.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the mean squared error, which is used when you want to predict a continuous value. If the model’s prediction was <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png" alt="x"> and the correct answer was <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/846baa2e2f.png" alt="y">,</nobr> then the mean squared error is defined as:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/47c0aa68b9.png" alt="\text{MSE}(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2"></p><p>We can observe some basic facts about the mean squared error. It’s differentiable, so we can find its derivative with respect to <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/1d97c6cd2a.png" alt="x">,</nobr> which lets us optimize the model parameters to minimize <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/8a02df084f.png" alt="\text{MSE}(x, y)"> using backpropagation. And it’s zero if and only if <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/199cbc9cce.png" alt="x = y">,</nobr> so a model which successfully minimizes it has learned to produce the correct answer.</p>
<p>But these facts don’t fully explain why people use mean squared error, since there are many other functions which also satisfy both properties. For example, <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6908b03ba2.png" alt="(x - y)^4"> and <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/927373fddc.png" alt="\sin^2(x-y)"> <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/624083313a.png" alt="+"> <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/646129c21d.png" alt="\sin^2(\pi(x-y))">.</nobr></p>
<p>Instead, we should look at the derivative, which is beautifully simple:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/c6b793041d.png" alt="\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \text{MSE}(x, y) = x - y"></p><p>Neither of the alternative functions mentioned above has such a simple derivative. The only function that comes close is <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/0ae56029b3.png" alt="|x-y|">,</nobr> whose derivative is <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d1847c4750.png" alt="\text{sgn}(x-y)">,</nobr> but most people would agree that a linear function is simpler than <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e42367d617.png" alt="\text{sgn}">,</nobr> which is nonlinear.</p>
<p>So, in plain English, the mean squared error is the loss function you get if you decide that your error signal should be equal to the difference between the output you wanted and the output your model gave. This explains why we should use it: why use anything more complicated if it’s not necessary?</p>
<h2 id="the-cross-entropy">The cross entropy</h2>
<p>It turns out that a very similar argument can be used to justify the cross entropy loss. I tried to search for this argument and couldn’t find it anywhere, although it’s straightforward enough that it’s unlikely to be original.</p>
<p>The cross entropy is used when you want to predict a discrete value. To define it, we’ll need to change our framework to make the model output a probability distribution <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png" alt="q"> instead of a scalar. The desired output will also be a distribution <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">.</nobr> We’ll represent our probability distributions as non-negative vectors of <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png" alt="N"> elements which add to 1. <nobr>(<img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/bd7b61a8ea.png" alt="N"></nobr> is the number of distinct values that our prediction target can take.)</p>
<p>The cross entropy is defined as:</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/aa99dd99c0.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/aa99dd99c0-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/aa99dd99c0.png" alt="H(p, q) = \sum_{i=1}^N -p_i \log q_i"></p><p>Just like the mean squared error, the cross entropy is differentiable, and it’s minimized if and only if <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/ed42bcf6f1.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/ed42bcf6f1-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/ed42bcf6f1.png" alt="p = q">.</nobr> It’s also linear in <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">,</nobr> which lets us use the following trick to estimate its gradient using only a sample from <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p"> instead of <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p"> itself (where <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e1caa65746.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/e1caa65746-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/e1caa65746.png" alt="\theta_k"> is a model parameter):</p>
 <p><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/193c66ad8e.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/193c66ad8e-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/193c66ad8e.png" alt="\begin{align*} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} H(p, q) &amp;= \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} \mathbb{E}_{i \sim p} [-\log q_i] \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{i \sim p} \left[\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} (-\log q_i) \right] \end{align*}"></p><p>This is essential for practical use because you don’t typically know the true distribution of labels <nobr>(<img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">).</nobr> Instead, you have a single label representing a sample from that distribution <nobr>(<img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/989092a634.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/989092a634-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/989092a634.png" alt="i\sim p">),</nobr> and you need to use it to estimate the gradient.</p>
<p>But even with the new constraint that the loss function should be linear in <nobr><img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/6aab8b8492.png" alt="p">,</nobr> there are still many alternative functions which satisfy all these properties. In fact, Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Examples_of_proper_scoring_rules">a list of them</a>.</p>
<p>So what sets cross entropy apart? To answer this question, let’s make an additional assumption about our model: we assume it produces logits <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png" alt="\ell"> and that its prediction <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/d84c14e225.png" alt="q"> is obtained from <img srcset="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png, https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3-4x.png 4x" src="https://jacobjackson.com/math/19adc84ed3.png" alt="\ell"> using the softmax function:</p>

    <!--INTRO START-->
    <p>Tor is a fantastic networking and privacy technology that makes private and anonymous browsing available to millions. Despite this, it is unfortunately seen by some people as a system that solely exists to facilitate an illegal criminal underground, </p>
    <p>However, to take a literal view, <i>Tor is just a networking tool</i>, and it can be used in any way that you want. The features that enable privacy and anonymity are also extremely useful for many of the tasks carried out by Network Engineers and Systems Administrators on a daily basis. For example:</p>

            <h3><u>Warning:</u></h3>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>The techniques described within this article should only be used in environments where you are permitted to do so.</p>
            <p>Please ensure that you comply with all local policies regarding the usage of Tor, including from your employer, customer/client, or other relevant entities.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="testing-ip-address-based-access-rules">Testing IP Address Based Access Rules</h2>
    <p>In some network environments, IP address based access rules are used to either restrict or allow access to a service, or are used as a decision factor in a conditional access policy. For example, a common use-case is removing the requirement for two-factor authentication upon login if you are connecting from a trusted IP address, or requiring additional verification steps when connecting for the first time from a new location.</p>
    <p>However, it is usually quite difficult to fully test such policies without access to multiple unique devices and/or VPNs.</p>
    <p>Using Tor and the Tor Browser, you can test your access rules from multiple arbitrary external IP addresses. You can also very easily reset your browser profile or establish a new Tor circuit at any time, allowing you to very easily create a new 'identity' for testing, without the risk of previous tests impacting the results.</p>
    <p>If you want to test something that isn't a web-based service, you can use the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper to force the network connections of any program to be routed over Tor. For example, to test an IP address based SSH access rule, you could route an SSH connection over Tor to make it originate from a new/unknown IP address:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks ssh <span>jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>Unfortunately <code>torsocks</code> cannot be used with setuid programs such as <code>ping</code>, nor can it be used with programs that exclusively use UDP.</p>

    <h2 id="testing-internally-hosted-services-from-an-external-perspective">Testing Internally-Hosted Services From an External Perspective</h2>
    <p>If you are hosting certain network services internally/on-site, e.g. web servers or mail servers, it can often be a challenge to properly test these from an external/public-facing perspective.</p>
    <p>It's very important that this testing is carried out, as network services will often have differing configurations or policies depending on where you are connecting from. The lack of an easy way to perform this testing internally often leads to crude solutions involving personal devices or mobile data tethering, which are neither convenient or reliable.</p>
    <p>However, similarly to how IP address based access rules can be tested with Tor, you can also use Tor to access your internally-hosted services from an external perspective. This will allow you to carry out all required testing from your standard device.</p>
    <p>For example, you can use <code>torsocks</code> with cURL:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks curl <span>https://www.jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>Alternatively, if you don't want to use the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper, you can point cURL to the local SOCKS5 proxy directly, which runs on <code>127.0.0.1:9050</code>:</p>
    <pre>$ curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 <span>https://www.jamieweb.net</span></pre>

    <h2 id="making-reliable-external-dns-lookups-when-operating-in-a-split-horizon-dns-environment">Making Reliable External DNS Lookups When Operating in a Split-Horizon DNS Environment</h2>
    <p>Most corporate networks operate a 'split-horizon' or 'split-brain' DNS setup, which is where a separate internally-hosted DNS server and associated zone is used to serve DNS requests that originate internally. The internal DNS server will often respond with 'internal' addresses, i.e. private or RFC1918 addresses, rather than 'external' public-facing addresses.</p>
    <p>This is usually used in combination with a configured search domain or DNS scope, in order to allow internal services to be accessed via their direct hostname, without requiring the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).</p>
    <p>However, these split-horizon DNS setups can often pose a problem when you explicitly need a request to go to an external DNS server. Some networks will forcefully route <i>all</i> DNS traffic to the internal DNS server, and others will even intercept and rewrite DNS responses at the network edge, e.g. using the DNS doctoring or DNS NAT rewriting features that are present in many commercial edge firewall products.</p>
    <p>You can usually get around these issues by forcing your external DNS lookups to take place over TCP, i.e. using the <code>+tcp</code> option in DiG (also known as 'virtual circuit' mode), but this isn't always supported or available.</p>
    <p>By routing your external DNS lookup over Tor, you can know for certain that the response hasn't been tampered with during the 'last mile' as it passes through your network edge:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks dig +tcp @1.1.1.1 <span>jamieweb.net</span></pre>
    <p>You'll need to use <code>+tcp</code> mode, as well as ensure that the request will be routed directly to the external DNS server, and not through a local caching resolver such as <code>dnsmasq</code>. This is because the Tor daemon will block requests to access local addresses such as <code>127.0.0.1</code>. If you do accidentally attempt to access a local address, Tor will display the following error:</p>
    <pre>WARNING torsocks[]: [connect] Connection to a local address are denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:192)</pre>

    <h2 id="bypassing-blocked-outbound-ports">Bypassing Blocked Outbound Ports</h2>
    <p>In many corporate network environments, permitted outbound ports are limited in order to help ensure that all outbound traffic is tightly controlled, e.g. for the purposes of Data Loss Prevention (DLP).</p>
    <p>However, for people in technical roles, this can pose quite a challenge, as various legitimate services will inadvertently be blocked too, and exceptions can be difficult to implement on a per-user basis.</p>
    <p>A common one that is often overlooked is the WHOIS protocol, which operates on TCP port 43.</p>
    <p>Using the <code>torsocks</code> wrapper, you can route these requests through Tor in order to get around the blocked outbound port:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks whois jamieweb.net</pre>
    <p>In some cases, firewalls performing Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) can also prevent certain connections to otherwise allowed ports. For example, a sysadmin using <code>openssl s_client</code> to retrieve a certificate from a web server may have their request blocked, as they aren't establishing a full HTTPS connection.</p>
    <p>However, by routing the request through Tor, the connection can be made successfully:</p>
    <pre>$ torsocks openssl s_client -connect jamieweb.net:443</pre>

    <h2 id="exposing-services-when-behind-nat-or-cgnat">Exposing Services When Behind NAT or CGNAT</h2>
    <p>There may be cases where you need to expose a locally running service to the internet, e.g. SSH or a web server. Unfortunately, this is often non-trivial due to NAT, and especially CGNAT (carrier-grade NAT).</p>
    <p>One particular use case that I've worked on is accessing a 4G-connected device remotely using SSH. Because the majority of consumer data plans operate using CGNAT, you cannot just bind the service to your perceived public address and have it work, as there will potentially be hundreds of other customers sharing that same IP address. Multiple layers of NAT are often used too, which of course complicates things.</p>
    <p>However, you can use Tor to expose your service via a Hidden Service, also known as a <code>.onion</code> site. This way, your service will be easily accessible over Tor no matter how many layers of NAT or filtering you are behind.</p>
    <p>This can be achieved by adding a few lines to your <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> configuration file:</p>
    <pre>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/<span>my_service</span>
HiddenServicePort <span>22 127.0.0.1:22</span></pre>
    <p>The <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> configuration specifies where your Hidden Service public/private keys will be stored. This should be an arbitrary directory in <code>/var/lib/tor/</code>. You should not create this yourself, as the Tor daemon will create it for you using the correct permissions.</p>
    <p>The <code>HiddenServicePort</code> option is used to specify where incoming requests to a specific port will be forwarded to. In this case, requests to the Hidden Service on port <code>22</code> will be forwarded verbatim to <code>127.0.0.1:22</code>.</p>
    <p>You can also optionally configure your Hidden Service in single-hop mode, which will allow it to connect to the Tor network using a single hop, rather than the usual three, potentially improving performance. <b>This will completely de-anonymise your Hidden Service, so <u>DO NOT</u> use single-hop mode if your own anonymity is important.</b> In most legitimate sysadmin use cases, single-hop mode is perfectly safe and acceptable.</p>
    <p>You can enable single-hop mode by adding the following to your Hidden Service configuration:</p>
    <pre>HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1</pre>
    <p>However, running in single-hop mode will prevent your Tor daemon being used as a client, as your connection to the Tor network is not anonymised. If a SOCKS port is configured in your <code>torrc</code> file, you'll also need to disable this:</p>
    <pre>SocksPort 0</pre>
    <p>Once you've finalised your Hidden Service configuration, save the <code>torrc</code> file and restart the Tor daemon:</p>
    <pre>sudo service tor restart</pre>
    <p>You can now view the <code>/var/lib/tor/my_service/hostname</code> file in order to identify the <code>.onion</code> address for your Hidden Service. This can be used from any other …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In the past decade, we've seen an explosion of innovation in AI and machine learning. However, coding itself was barely touched by AI. The most significant example of AI-powered coding tools is editor autocomplete extensions like Kite or Tabnine. </p>
<p>At Repl.it, we believe this is about to change. With the advent of natural language models like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT</a>, for the first time, we're seeing an ML model that performs shockingly well on all sorts of language-related tasks including coding.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to and excited by the applications of natural language models in coding when I read the 2012 paper <a href="https://amasad.me/public/natural.pdf">"On the Naturalness of Software,"</a> which leveraged an incredibly simple NLP technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-gram</a> to build an autocomplete engine that rivaled industry standards. </p>
<p>GPT-3, the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">newest model from OpenAI</a>, is a multiple order of magnitude in power, making it feel closer to magic. We got access to the new model, which still in beta, and we quickly got to work building coding tools:</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Reading code is hard! Don't you wish you could just ask the code what it does? To describe its functions, its types.</p><p>And maybe... how can it be improved?</p><p>Introducing: <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Replit</a> code oracle 🧙‍♀️</p><p>It's crazy, just got access to <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OpenAI</a> API and I already have a working product! <a href="https://t.co/HX4MyH9yjm">pic.twitter.com/HX4MyH9yjm</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>In this example, what we're seeing is an AI assistant who can answer questions related to coding, which we believe is a first of its kind. You can ask all sorts of questions. High-level questions like "What does this code do?" to questions about the program's details, like "what's the type of x?."</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking and thrilling that it can also give you ideas on extending the project and where to take it. </p>
<p>To make it clear that this wasn't trained on some small subset of types of projects, we took a random project from our community and ran it on it as well:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just to prove that it works on totally novel code, here is a recent project from our community: <a href="https://t.co/oA15YOZtFw">https://t.co/oA15YOZtFw</a></p><p>- It described it!<br>- Told me how to improve it!<br>- Told me where to post it after I improved it!</p><p>It's an awesome tool to make learning programming fun! <a href="https://t.co/Fnkd69DgXU">pic.twitter.com/Fnkd69DgXU</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285797739930869761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Now, this is pretty mindblowing. But we also wanted to do something more concretely useful. We thought, what if the AI could fix simple syntax errors. The kind that newbies tend to run into and sometimes get stuck. </p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you've ever taught programming you know that newbies make simple mistakes like mixing between strings and variables, not closing parenthesis or quotes, etc.</p><p>Many then get stuck and quit learning programming.</p><p>Working on a code fixer for <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> to fix this problem: <a href="https://t.co/DUxMAPGQfV">pic.twitter.com/DUxMAPGQfV</a></p></div>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285997706884706304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>These are just the tip of the iceberg we're hacking on many more ideas. But just to give you an idea of what's possible, here is a demo where GPT-3 is used to generate React.js components: </p>
<blockquote>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284807152603820032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<h2 id="ai-and-the-future-of-coding">AI and the future of coding</h2>
<p>So what does this mean for programming? Does it mean that there is no point in learning programming because it will get fully automated? </p>
<p>We don't believe so. Here is what we think the impact will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI-assisted coding will remove the drudgery out of coding. We'll have tools that help us code faster. We'll see more sophisticated code generation and refactor tools, and repetitive coding tasks -- the moments you see yourself copy-pasting code -- might get automated away wholly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>AI will make it easier to learn programming (and many other things). Imagine Codecademy-like courses entirely guided by AI with conversational abilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eventually, AI will influence how we design programming languages, and a new class of languages will emerge. Since computers will be better and faster than humans at generating code, the act of programming itself might change. Who knows, we might be able to program by talking or even by moving in VR/AR. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point -- probably not in the near future -- the word "coding" will disappear from our lexicon because programming will stop requiring code and instead be about the pure act of solving problems using computers making it accessible to more and more people. </p>
<p>In the meantime, if you haven't yet, you should still learn how to code and get good at it. It's unlikely that things will change meaningfully in the short-term, and coding is still the best way to program computers. But keep your eyes open to the future, and we'll do our best at Repl.it to build the most advanced programming environment regardless of the modality. </p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>In addition to GPT-3 we're also experimenting with more ways to bring AI into coding. In the following example, Sergei Chestakov, an engineer at Repl.it built an app that lets you execute hand-written code!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm building an app that let's you take a picture of handwritten code and execute it: <a href="https://t.co/4s4Pvychqf">pic.twitter.com/4s4Pvychqf</a></p>— Sergei (@SergeiChestakov) <a href="https://twitter.com/SergeiChestakov/status/1289726580210561025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We're <a href="https://repl.it/@util/jerbs#open-positions/ai.txt">hiring AI engineers</a> to bring AI into coding. If this is something you're passionate about we'd love to talk to you!</p>

                    <p>TikTok utilizes Artificial Intelligence to elevate content to various users, and enables content makers to make recordings with music, filters and other improvements. If you are looking for extreme entertainment, but you don't like to spend hours on your smartphone, TikTok is the answer. If you like short dance videos, lip-syncs, comedy, parody, or other talent videos, TikTok offers a one-stop solution. There will not be any online user who does not know about Tiktok.</p><p>Tiktok is built in 2016 by <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/">ByteDance</a>, a Chinese internet technology company. After a successful merger with Musical.ly, Tiktok was finally launched for the United States on August 2, 2018. TikTok has become the most downloaded app in 2018 and 2019. </p><h3 id="what-made-tiktok-the-highest-downloaded-mobile-app">What Made TikTok the Highest downloaded mobile App?</h3><p>Some people count the number of downloads to rank the most rated app. For this, TikTok yet stays the giant with more than 2 billion app downloads globally. Tiktok stands at 4<sup>th</sup> position with 800 million active users. Facebook, Messenger, and Whatsapp hold the top position in social media app ranking. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Wq3n5IFQHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>What makes TikTok so popular?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the content published in TikTok is fantastic and addictive. But we cannot disregard the algorithm behind this app that keeps the user flooded with the videos of interest. This article is solely confined to the backend artificial intelligence programs that made TikTok user-friendly and more interactive. This discussion includes critical features and their respective AI programs for TikTok.</p><h3 id="how-is-tiktok-different-from-other-apps-the-recommendation-engine-">How is TikTok Different from other Apps? The Recommendation Engine!</h3><p>Recommendation engines are <strong>data filtering tools</strong> that work on the interest of a particular user. For this purpose, they use algorithms and searched data and then mention it as a recommendation in the sidebar of a particular platform. You can compare them with a ‘’shopkeeper guy.’’ When you ask him for a specific item, he also shows you some other products. At the same time, these products are based on the interest you have shown previously. With the rising number of data finders on search engines, the amount of data providers also raised. Moreover, particular platforms also use recommendation engines to keep the user on their site for a long time.</p><p>There must be a reliable data basis that collects and stores information and show it in real-time. It will then favor a variety of abstract layers like algorithm, serving, and application layers to appear on the front. Ultimately, it resolves many business person’s issues. </p><p>Typically, there are two standpoints for TikTok; the one represents the creator side while the other covers the consumer's side.</p><h3 id="1-content-creator">1- &nbsp;Content Creator</h3><p>TikTok supports content producers with AI to create viral content. Its robust AI system suggests the producers about keywords, hashtags, video editing, and attractive music selection. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="2-consumer-side">2- &nbsp;Consumer Side</h3><p>TikTok’s efficient algorithm notices the likes and comments of the users. It also focuses on their retention time on a particular video and then offers them the video of their interest. <strong> &nbsp;</strong></p><h3 id="what-will-appear-first-in-a-new-tiktok-user-s-feed">What will Appear First in a New TikTok User’s Feed? &nbsp;</h3><p>TikTok lowers inconvenience by not forcing the audience to sign-up first. It gets information about your taste by the first video you watch and the time you spent on it. The original content that appears in your TikTok feed is based on the data you provide during signing-up on the app. TikTok’s archetype traces your location, age, and gender to show you the content that matches the above-provided information. After it, TikTok will show you data related to your first search on the engine. </p><p>The primary purpose of every app is to engage the audience for a longer time by reducing the exit rate. TikTok efficiently shows you the most loved video by the audience in your location. After getting enough information about your interest, it will trace your metrics and offer a final score.</p><p>If you click on a celebrity video, it will add it to your favorites. Then next time when you come on the app, you’ll see related videos on top as a recommendation. Further, it analyses your curiosity to favor you with precise recommendations. &nbsp;</p><p>There are several theories related to TikTok’s algorithms. The user experience and expert analysis make their basis. </p><h3 id="batch-theory">Batch Theory</h3><p>When a user uploads a video, it undergoes through different batch pools to distinguish its content from others. In this scenario, the algorithm traces its watching history, personal preferences, location. Your content becomes famous if it gets more likes, sharing, and comments than usual. So, the algorithm assigns a score to your content based on the points mentioned above.</p><p>Finally, if the algorithm finds your content impressive, then it exposes your unique content to a big audience. According to this theory, it will take a week or more to become a celebrity. It also includes that engage more audience in trending topics to get more promotions. </p><h3 id="delay-momentum">Delay Momentum</h3><p>This theory suggests the data uploaders not to delete their content; it doesn't matter how rough it is. Some users also share their experience that some pieces of their content were not so appealing. They started using the app less than before, and they eventually saw a rise in their audience. In this way, TikTok cares about its users and feel them they are essential to its community. The TikTokers get passion and start producing new content to retain the audience. </p><p>This theory suggests that the success of your account to be viral is only depends on your introductory videos. If you succeed in gaining some likes and views, then TikTok’s AI considers you a perfect match. Now the algorithm provided you the audience, and you, in return, have to sustain it with fantastic content.</p><p>Three primary pillars help TikTok archetypes are:</p><ul><li>Tagging the content</li><li>Producing user-profiles and user scenarios and</li><li>Training and helping recommendation algorithms.</li></ul><p>Here is a detailed conversation about them.</p><h3 id="data-and-features">Data and Features</h3><p>Firstly., we consider what data is? Recommendation model comes with the user's fulfillment by providing the User Generated Content. For this information, input data comes from three-dimension.</p><p><strong><em>Content Data</em></strong><br>TikTok is widely in use over the world; thus, it also has a variety of information. Every type of content has a unique taste and should be in different categories. So, the system should be strong enough to show specific data in a specific recommendation. </p><p><strong><em>User Data</em> </strong><br>This data includes the user's personal information like age, gender, career, and demographics. It also adds some hidden features form ML-based customer clustering.</p><p><strong><em>Scenario Data</em></strong><br>As its name shows, it tracks user's preference shifts and uses scenarios on variable scenarios. For instance, what kind of video a user loves to watch while traveling, working, jogging, and many more.</p><p>Once the data collection is done successfully, then the four critically planned features are introduced into the recommendation engine. </p><h3 id="correlation-features">Correlation Features</h3><p>They correlate the content characteristics with user tags, containing keywords, theme tag, source matching, and arrangement tag. Moreover, they also represent latent features like vector separation between content and the user.</p><p><strong><em>User-Scenario Features</em></strong><br>These tags monitor scenario data like physical location time, and date of content uploaded with event tags. </p><p><strong><em>Trend Features</em> </strong><br>They represent a worldwide trend that becomes a hot topic in a specific time. However, they also denote top keywords, trending themes, and user interaction with them.</p><p><strong><em>Collaborative Features</em></strong><br>These features work based on a collaborating filtering strategy. It equilibrates the bias recommendation (narrow) and generalized recommendation (collaborative). Furthermore, this feature not only records data of an individual but also a group of related people with the same interests. It also traces their interests, impression click-through rate, themes, and keywords. In this way, the above-discussed features decide what to show in a particular scenario to a particular user. </p><h3 id="tiktok-recommendation-system">TikTok Recommendation System</h3><p>After video uploading, the robust algorithm uses a highly-efficient NLP and computer vision system for video analysis. Just like humans, it read every part of your video, including audio, video images, captions, and hashtags. Then it assigns it a specific category according to the content and context of the material. </p><p>The working strategy of TikTok will shock you. It exposes every new coming data to a small audience and evaluates your hard work based on the viewer's interest. After all, it will decide a score for your video as:</p><table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Watch-again rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>10 Points</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Retention time</p>

<p>2 Points</p>
</td>

</tbody>
</table><p>Moreover, its robust AI system also distinguishes between looping and non-looping videos. Looping content doesn't help to make you viral. If your video catches the high score, it means your video is in the right list of TikTok’s algorithm. It will share your video with the right audience having the same head and heart. &nbsp;</p><p>Your video doesn’t go viral if it's unable to get the rank, as mentioned above. But still don’t lose heart, Delay Momentum Theory works here. Now you are well familiar with how TikTok retains the audience for more significant periods. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="intangible-goals">Intangible Goals</h3><p>In the recommendation model, all objectives, including clicks, likes, dislikes, comments, re-posts, and reading time, are assess-able. The algorithms use this information rightly and then show it as a prediction precisely. But there are some other imperceptible objectives; for them, the recommendation engine can’t provide quantifiable information. </p><p>For the maintenance of a healthy and user-friendly environment, TikTok is going to overpower all violent content. The platform is deciding to remove all content related to pornography, scamming, pomposity, and even political news.

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">

<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>
</div>
<div id="null-a-bag-of-surprises">

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>or <code>UN…</code></p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>Explorer is a power tool for GPT-3 experimentation with <strong>full history</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and the community’s <strong>best-practices</strong> built-in. If you’re just getting started with GPT-3 or don’t want to build out your own boilerplate codebase, try the hosted version: <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">Explorer</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-ui-for-experimentation">A UI for experimentation</h2>

<p>To get good results from GPT-3, you need to experiment. (Despite what the cherry-picked examples on Twitter will have you believe!)</p>

<p>This fundamental insight led to Explorer’s first feature: saved history. They say the difference between tinkering and science is rigor and reproducibility. We codified that transition by making all our prompts and settings automatically saved and shareable. Annotations further allowed us to build and improve upon previous results.</p>

<p>Long term, we envision an environment that enables the development of higher level APIs on top of GPT-3. A system for designing pipelines of prompts, complex scripts, logic to retrieve external information — that can all be published for use in products and research.</p>

<p>Building complex applications requires you to work at a higher level of abstraction than machine code. <strong>How can we build an open source operating system for GPT-3 at the dawn of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>?</strong></p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved!</h2>

<p>There’s a long road ahead and we’re thankful for all of your feedback and suggestions so far. We welcome code contributions to Explorer - pop over to <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">the repository</a> to learn how you can get it running locally!</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="building-together">Building together</h3>

<p>The community is continually discovering incredible methods for unlocking GPT-3’s potential. Without the right set of tools, most practitioners struggle to find and implement these new techniques.</p>

<p>That’s where we see the need for an open source project where we can all rapidly experiment and codify what we’ve learned. Here are some of the community’s methods and best practices that we’re excited to incorporate as features in Explorer:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This method skirts the token limit by “chaining” together prompts and their outputs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining">Chaining</a> breaks down larger tasks into component sub-tasks, before composing them back together in a single prompt to get your final result.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context stuffing</strong></p>

<p>This is a method of iterative prompt improvement that involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running an initial prompt</li>
  <li>Cherrypicking the best GPT-3 outputs,</li>
  <li>Appending them to the original prompt, to provide more examples for GPT-3 to use.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h3>

<p>In the coming months, with your help, we plan to build these features (and more!). As the private beta comes to an end, let’s enable new GPT-3 users to hit the ground running with the cumulative, collective insights of the community.</p>

<p>As we receive feedback and contributions from the community, this roadmap will continue to change and be reprioritized. You can follow a live version of it <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and importing prompts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“GitHub for Prompts”. Let’s make it easy to share and build on each others’ work!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt evaluation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GPT’s performance is very, very sensitive to prompt design. So iterating on prompt design is our highest priority.</li>
  <li>With built-in tools for prompt evaluation, you can annotate, rank and sort results for the same task across different prompt designs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scripting &amp; chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable commands which can trigger scripts.</li>
  <li>These scripts can then: <em>i.</em> do computation, or <em>ii.</em> trigger API requests to do actions, get more information, call other prompts, etc.</li>
  <li>In particular, this scripting interface can chain prompts together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Higher level API interface</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OpenAI API is all about simplicity, it is a raw text-in, text-out interface, which is great to build on top of but does not make it easy to best take advantage of the tool.</li>
  <li>We envision a higher level API which you can use to develop higher-level reasoning and operations on top of the low level API. Turn any prompt, which itself can be a pipeline of other prompts, into an API.</li>
  <li>This enables a more broadly useful natural language interface for: chat, question answering, text transformations, multi-step labeling, and other pipelines of natural language operations</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main-content"> <section> <div>   <p>We’re excited to announce the first beta release and general availability of the <strong>Rome</strong> linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p> <p>This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/#development-status">more</a>, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.</p> <p>Rome is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is <strong>not</strong> a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits">largely</a> from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase.</p> <p>Rome is designed to replace <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and others.</p> <p>We have significant implementations already for most components, including compiling, bundling, and testing, all using the same core abstractions and internal libraries. Rome is even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosted</a> and we use them to <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">build and develop Rome itself</a>! Once usage as a linter has stabilized, we will move onto the unreleased features to prepare and generalize them for public usage.</p> <p>Linting is an excellent low-risk way for us to mature and validate shared functionality like editor integration, configuration, parallelization, caching, parsing, and dependency analysis. It is not in the critical build path for development so is relatively straight forward and safe to adopt.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span> rome check

See the full <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/docs/lint/rules">list of rules</a>. You can expect a full featured experience, however may still encounter bugs. With most of the feature development out of the way we will be focusing primarily on stability.</p> <p>Most of our rules have been inspired by their ESLint equivalents. This required a complete rewrite to utilize Rome’s API that differ extensively from existing tools. Without the amazing work of the ESLint team and community establishing these recommended patterns, we would not have been able to pull this off.

At the time I wasn’t trying to solve any particular problem, I was just building and experimenting with existing libraries and teaching myself new concepts. Over time though, as the project exploded in popularity, so did the scope and mission of the project.</p> <p>We renamed <strong>6to5</strong> to <strong>Babel</strong> to take on a new role as a general platform for doing static JavaScript transformation. This meant a plugin system and a new commitment to supporting future JavaScript standards and proposed features.</p> <p>We also planned on expanding Babel to be used as the base for other JavaScript language tooling by using shared public libraries. From the Babel blog post “<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0">6.0.0 Released</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost">Jamie Kyle</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we think we can go even further. Babel should be able to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <img width="600" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/6to5-to-babel.png" alt="Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo"> <figcaption>Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo</figcaption> </figure> <p>In 2016, I left the project, and those plans never materialized. Over time, I learned the Babel would not have been able to successfully adapt to execute on this vision anyway. The solution to plugins was “expose all the internals” which is an extremely large API surface area to maintain and restricts your ability to make any changes.</p> <p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers.</p> <p>There would have been no way to provide backward compatibility, and with expectations already set, any significant changes to the project would have introduced an extremely high amount of ecosystem churn.</p> <p>In an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, if all components of an object are replaced, is it the same object? There is far less confusion and friction to release something entirely new than drastically change something that’s already in widespread usage. I had since moved on from the project, and so any evolution would not have been possible, and would have required complete vision alignment.</p> <p>Even though I wasn’t involved in Babel, I still maintained a presence in the developer tooling ecosystem. I eventually went on to develop other tools like <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and be involved in projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a>. This work continued to develop the ideas that would eventually become Rome and shaped my philosophy on developer experience. A focus on excellent errors, clean user interface, and minimal configuration.</p> <figure> <img width="500" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/introducing-rome-post-babel-logos.png" alt="The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper"> <figcaption>The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper</figcaption> </figure> <p>The original idea behind Babel had always stuck. What sort of capabilities would be possible if a tool did more than one thing? This sort of philosophy has always seemed alien in the JavaScript ecosystem where micropackages and arbitrary separation of concerns are the norms. These tools being independent has never provided the sort of user autonomy and efficiency that most skeptics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tools proclaim.</p> <p>Language tooling maintainers spend so much time working on the same things. Processing source code, whether it’s in a transpiler like Babel, linting it in ESLint, or bundling it in Webpack, is fundamentally the same problem with overlapping responsibilities and technical implementation.</p> <p>A linter in the JavaScript ecosystem is exactly the same as a compiler. They both consume code, then produce compiled code and errors. What the compiled code is varies. In the case of a linter, the compiled code is formatted source code with automatic fixes applied. The more powerful your compilation infrastructure, the more theoretically powerful your linter could be. These commonalities extend to pretty much anything that involves language processing. We can build more powerful tools using a shared base that is easily adaptable.</p> <p>I had always maintained private repos where I would experiment with ideas, but the original code that would become Rome was started at the beginning of 2017 while I was working for Facebook in my free time. I continued iterating and experimenting on the idea and building out all the different pieces, until 2019, when I was given the opportunity to work on and explore using it at Facebook full-time.</p> <p>I eventually left Facebook and the project became open source in February 2020 where I would continue it as an independent community-driven project.</p> <p>Rome is the spiritual successor of Babel. I’ve taken the lessons I learnt, and refined the mission. Rather than exposing a large public API for other tools to be built on, we are building them all in one place, with batteries included. I’m excited to be trying something new that the JavaScript and web ecosystem haven’t seen before.</p> <p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck">Sebastian McKenzie</a></p> </section>  </div> </section> </main> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>In this article, we will learn about India's Unified Payments Interface. A four-year-old payment scheme that has been accounting for 40-45% of digital payments across India. In December 2019, Google <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/November/20191113/OP-1670/OP-1670_110719_136981_396266957468_1.pdf">recommended</a> the Federal Reserve to follow the model of UPI for the design of FedNow.</p><p>It is going to be a 3 part series.</p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>(this article): We will cover the background and basics. We will learn about the different participants and their roles in the UPI ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle"><strong>Part 2:</strong></a> We take a deep-dive into UPI by tracing a UPI transaction from the beginning through the end.</p><p><strong><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-settlement">Part 3:</a></strong> We will look at settlements and understand how money exchanges hands.</p><hr><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Since its inception in 2016, UPI has grown tremendously over the last 4 years. It has enabled a whole new set of individuals to transact digitally for the first time.</p><p>There were multiple attempts towards making India a cashless society. Earlier solutions were not simple to use and relied heavily on Netbanking facilities provided by the banks. The experience was not standard. Because of all these reasons, it was mostly used only by the tech-savvy population. India being a diverse country needed a system that has a plethora of payment apps that are optimised for different cohorts.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1088" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Growth of UPI</figcaption></figure><p>The primary objective of UPI was to build an open payment system that is mobile-first, fast, and interoperable across different banks.</p><p>For a developing country like India, going mobile-first was almost a no brainer. Mobile Phones and Mobile Data were getting cheaper and the trend was clear.</p><p>Interoperability simply puts the user’s needs at the center. The users can opt for any payment app, link it with their bank account to engage in commerce with anyone across India.</p><p>Think about it, all of us want to use payment apps that we like, instead of being limited to a poorly designed app that’s provided by the bank where we keep our money. We should let banks do what they do best (which is managing money) and let tech companies handle building intuitive user interfaces for transacting money.</p><p>UPI was built on this principle to let private players innovate on top of public digital infrastructure.</p><h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-upi">So, What exactly is UPI?</h3><p>UPI is a payment markup language and a standard for interoperable payments in India.</p><p>To make the process of transacting money simple, UPI introduced the concept of human friendly unique IDs called UPI Virtual Payment Addresses (or VPAs). The VPAs are usually of the form <strong><em>&lt;unique_identifier&gt;</em></strong>@<strong><em>&lt;address_provider&gt;</em></strong>.</p><p>The UPI VPAs are similar to email addresses. They are interoperable. A gmail user can send an email to a yahoo user. </p><p>Some simple examples UPI VPAs are <strong><em>alice@ybl </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob@axis</em></strong>. Here, <strong><em>ybl</em></strong> and <strong><em>axis </em></strong>are two banks that provide virtual payment addresses. And, <strong><em>alice </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob </em></strong>are the unique identifiers in respective address providers.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/payment_markup.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Just like how domains get resolved to IP addresses, every VPA needs to be linked to a bank account. The UPI handles get resolved to bank accounts and IFSC during the payment (we will see how).</p><p>In short, a UPI Virtual Payment Address serves as the addressing layer for a bank account.</p><p>There are mainly two types of transactions in the UPI realm.</p><h4 id="direct-payment">Direct Payment</h4><p>The payer (the sender) initiates the transaction. Typical examples would be, you paying a shopkeeper at the checkout by scanning a QR code or you sending money to your friends and family.</p><h4 id="collect-request">Collect Request</h4><p>The payee (the receiver) initiates the transaction. A simple example is a scenario where your landlord creates a collect request asking you to pay the monthly rent.</p><hr><h2 id="the-ecosystem">The Ecosystem</h2><p>There are three types of participants in the UPI ecosystem.</p><h3 id="the-banks">The Banks</h3><p>Banks hold your money. UPI works directly with the bank accounts, unlike Paytm, Venmo, or CashApp. The bank account will be debited from or credited to whenever you send money or receive money.</p><p>The banks that hold your money are also called <em>Issuing Banks</em>.</p><p>Every bank uses a system called Core Banking System (CBS) to manage its user’s accounts. At the core, CBS is a simple <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> system built around user accounts.</p><p>Debit and Credit are the two fundamental operations of core banking software.The debit is when you’re taking money out of your account. The amount involved is subtracted from your balance. On the other hand, when you’re getting paid, its a credit. The money is added to your account.</p><p>Banks also maintain another UPI specific database. We will discuss more on that later.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png" alt="" width="2328" height="1840" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-payment-apps">The Payment Apps</h3><p>Payment Apps are consumer-centric products that can be used to link a bank account and transact in the real world. Some major apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc. Almost all the banks have their own versions of UPI Apps. There is a wide variety of options to chose from.</p><p>Payment Apps allow users to create handles to make everyday transactions easier. However, not everyone can start creating UPI handles. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates who can create UPI handles. Currently, only the member banks of the UPI ecosystem are allowed to do so.</p><p>That’s why all the payment apps will have to tie up with banks. These banks not only allow payment apps to create and manage UPI handles for their users, but they are also the interface to the UPI ecosystem.</p><p>These banks are called <em>Acquiring Banks</em>.</p><p>Google Pay has tied up with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. PhonePe has a tie-up with Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.</p><p>Banks provide separate APIs to allow payment apps to create and manage the UPI handles.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png" alt="" width="2540" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="npci">NPCI</h3><p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a non-profit set up by the Government of India to facilitate digital payments. They facilitate many payment schemes (like IMPS, BBPS, FASTag, etc.)</p><p>If we reflect back on the original objective of UPI, it was to build an interoperable system. An interoperable means anyone could download a payment app, link any bank (that they own), and transact with anyone else from any other bank.</p><p>One primitive way of building such an interoperable network would be to connect every payment app with every bank. As you’re probably guessing, that’s a very inefficient way of doing it, even if we assume something like that is possible. It practically not possible.</p><p>And, the only thing that’s constant in the software realm, is the fact that systems keep changing and breaking. Imagine the pain that everyone has to go through in reaching a consensus when configurations or infrastructures change. It would be chaos.</p><p>This approach is the same as building an Internet where your browser has to remember the IP address of every possible website on the planet, otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to access it.</p><p>Of course, the Internet is not built in this fashion. The job of resolving every web address into an IP address is taken out as a separate protocol called DNS. Our browsers trust the IP address resolved by the DNS servers used by our Internet Service Providers.</p><p>Introducing standardization and a trusted third party will result in a completely different architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s the route UPI creators took, they made NPCI as the trusted switch and they standardized the protocol. NPCI makes sure that data flow between banks and payment apps are routed to the correct and verified destinations.</p><p>The end result, the payment apps, and banks talk just to NPCI and can be assured by NPCI that they are really interacting with who they intend to.</p><p>To make this easy to understand, we made a GIF.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="851" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Apart from being the trusted router, NPCI also hosts non-financial meta APIs to serve everyone in the ecosystem.</p><p>Some examples of meta API are <em>listAccountProviders (returns all details of all banks), validateAddress (helps in validating VPAs), requestOtp (for 2FA), </em>etc.</p><p>NPCI has one more important role to play. It’s something to do with settlement. We will cover in the last part of the series.</p><hr><p>Before we wrap the first series, let's quickly visit authentication.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>UPI uses 2-factor authentication. Commonly used factors are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Possession_factors" rel="noopener">possession factor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Knowledge_factors" rel="noopener">knowledge factor</a>.</p><p>UPI being mobile-first, the possession factor (“what a user has”) is the user’s phone. It’s validated using the device fingerprint.</p><p>The knowledge factor (“what a user knows”) is the 4 digits or 6 digits UPI PIN.</p><p>The authentication scheme is designed to be flexible and can use different authentication factors in the future.</p><p>We will learn how these authentication factors are verified in the upcoming articles.</p><hr><p>That’s a wrap of the first part of the series.</p><p>We hope you enjoyed it. Share it with the intellectually curious folks in your circle. If you have any questions regarding UPI or anything related to Fintech in general, feel free to post them on our <a href="https://discuss.setu.co/">forum</a>.</p><p>In the <a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle">next part</a> of the series, we will take a detailed look into how UPI transactions work. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.prepear.com/">Prepear</a> is a meal planner and grocery list app that helps people discover recipes and more. It’s a spin off from the founders of <em><a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/">Super Healthy Kids</a></em> and right now they saying its logo is under legal attack from Apple.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>It’s funny what Instagram accounts you follow as a parent at some point. Yesterday, we noticed <em>Super Healthy Kids</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmcFEInZK7/">sharing a post</a> detailing their new legal woes with Apple.</p>
<p>According to the founders, Apple “has opposed the trademark application for our small business, Prepear, demanding that we change our obviously pear shaped logo, used to represent our brand in the recipe management and meal planning business.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">In a petition on Change.org</a>, Prepear goes on to say, “before attacking us, Apple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos. Many of those logos were changed or abandoned. Most small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.”</p>
<p>Prepear says they are a small company with only five staff and legal costs have already cost them “many thousands of dollars” plus laying off one team member, in their legal fight against the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>“It is a very terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the largest companies in the world, even when we have clearly done nothing wrong, and we understand why most companies just give in and change their logos,” adds Prepear in its plea for support.</p>
<p>Prepear says they “feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple’s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.”</p>
<p>So far, just over 8,200 signatures have been signed out of a goal of 10,000 on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">change.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the two logos above, I can’t say the Prepear logo resembles the Apple logo at all. But of course, Apple feels different about that.</p>
<p>Prepear is a free app and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prepear/id1248495163">download on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prepear.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can check out Apple’s trademark opposition filed above (via <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">MacRumors</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Update August 9</strong>: Prepear’s COO, Russ Monson, told <em>iPhone in Canada</em> in an email more insight in regards to the company’s filing of their trademark for the ‘pear’ logo.</p>
<p>Monson says Prepear filed their trademark for the logo back in January 2017 and eventually was told by the U.S. Trademark office “that it was not in conflict with any other registered trademarks and that they would publish it for opposition.” Everything seemed good to go.</p>
<p>That was until on the “on the last day of the window to oppose the trademark we received notice that Apple had filed for an extension of the window to oppose, and they subsequently filed for additional extensions which put our trademark in legal limbo for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>According to Monson, Apple filed their actual opposition on the final day they were legally allowed. Subsequent extensions filed result in more legal fees for a company like Prepear to take on, which they said “seemed designed by their legal team to be made as long, difficult, and expensive as possible for us.”</p>
<p>Monson goes on to explain Prepear was “naive enough” to think they could discuss the matter with Apple rationally, as both logos look different. But that wasn’t the case and the opposition has reached the ‘discovery phase’, which the COO says will “be the most expensive part of this case for us.”</p>
<p>After Apple filed to proceed to discovery phase, that’s what Prepear decided to start their petition. “We believe that this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple’s position on this that Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than have the public see how they are clearly harming us for no apparent justifiable reason,” said Monson to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em></p>
<p>Prepear says they aren’t asking for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone maker to “stop attacking small businesses like ours in frivolous cases that seem designed to cause us to spend as much money and time thinking about the case instead of focusing on how to grow our business and ensure we survive the current economic crisis.”</p>
<p>Monson shared with<em> iPhone in Canada</em> some other oppositions Apple had previously filed against, in a similar fashion to what is happening them right now. These companies below gave up when Apple reached out, but Prepear says they are lucky to garner enough media attention “to expose this practice by Apple.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg" alt="" width="992" height="1042" srcset="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg 992w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-333x350.jpg 333w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-457x480.jpg 457w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-768x807.jpg 768w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-660x693.jpg 660w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-560x588.jpg 560w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></p>
<p>Prepear says it will be handing its petition of signatures–which currently stands at nearly 19,000 signatures–to Apple soon and will be sharing updates on what happens. The company explains to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it hopes Apple will drop the case before it gets to more expensive discovery and trial phases.</p>

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>
<h2 id="docker-network-theory">Docker Network Theory</h2>
<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-host-network-bridge">Single-host network bridge</h2>
<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="connecting-container-directly-to-host-network-stack">Connecting container directly to host network stack</h2>
<p>Docker gives us possibility to integrate container network stack into host stack.<br>
In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

<p>It will create for us docker network - all containers connected to this network will be visible in docker host network as they were normal separate from docker host that host them machines.</p>
<p>Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>with MACVLAN you can easily exhaust IP adresses in your network</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the past few years, I’ve been involved in migrations from Xcode workspace based build system to Buck twice (Facebook and Snapchat). Both of these experiences took talented engineers multi-months work with many fixes upstreamed to get it work. Recently, I’ve been helping another company to migrate their iOS project from Xcode workspace based build system to Bazel. This experience may be relevant to other people, considering the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html#migrating-to-bazel">Bazel guide</a> is quite light on details.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Why in these companies, people choose to use alternative build tools such as Buck or Bazel but not Xcode? There are a few reasons:</p>

<h3 id="better-code-review-and-dependency-management">Better Code Review and Dependency Management</h3>

<p>Xcode stores its build configurations in both xcscheme files and pbxproj files. None of them are text-editor friendly and heavily rely on Xcode GUI for its configurations. There are ways to only use xcconfig, a text-based configuration file for pbxproj. But for many real-world projects, that is just the third place for build configurations rather than the only source of truth. As a result, configuration changes are impossible to review effectively in any popular web tools (GitHub / Gitlab / Gerrit).</p>

<p>Xcode does dependency management in implicit ways. Thus, you have to create xcworkspace to include all dependent sub-projects for build. This is problematic if you want to split your projects and tests into smaller manageable units. That often ends up with many xcworkspace projects and each need to have manual dependency management and being included in CI tool.</p>

<h3 id="better-caching-and-faster-build-speed">Better Caching and Faster Build Speed</h3>

<p>Xcode’s build cache management is quite incompetent. A change in the scheme can result in rebuilding from scratch. Switching between branches can often result in full rebuilding as well.</p>

<p>Bazel is a <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/#hermetic-builds-nqslhnid">hermetic build system</a>. If a file or its dependency doesn’t change, a rebuild won’t be triggered. Switching between branches won’t slow down the build because artifacts are cached by its content.</p>

<p>Bazel provided an upgrade path from its primitive disk-based cache system to <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">a distributed remote cache</a>. You can make a switch when the codebase grows or the team grows.</p>

<h3 id="better-modularization">Better Modularization</h3>

<p>Swift likes to have smaller modules. Having each module as its own project poses challenges in code review and dependency management. There are alternative solutions such as Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods. Both of them have their unique set of problems (SPM is often too opinionated, while CocoaPods is slow and invasive).</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Engineering teams often have competing priorities. For many teams, it is unlikely that their starting point will be a Bazel-based project (hopefully this will change in the future). When to prioritize the migration to Bazel? I’ve read it somewhere a good summary on this, and will just put it here: <em>a good time to migrate to Bazel is when you about to need it</em>. If the team starts to feel the pain of Xcode-based build system (multi-minute build time, a ball of mud mono-project, or many small projects but with CI brokages many times every week), it can often take months to do the migration. On the other hand, when you have only 2 people developing an app, it is simply hard to judge the value proposition.</p>

<p>A semi mono-project, with 3 to 4 developers, and some external dependencies (~10 CocoaPods libraries) would be a good place to allocate 1 engineer-week to do the transition. That’s what I did here.</p>



<p>The first step of the migration is to set up the tools. We will use <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk">Bazelisk</a> to manage Bazel versions, and will symlink Bazelisk to <code>/usr/local/bin/bazel</code> for ease of access. For Xcode integration, we will use <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi">Tulsi</a>. It will be installed from source. Both tools are checked out under: <code>$HOME/${Company_Name}/devtools</code> directory. The installation is automated through scripts inside the repository.</p>

<h2 id="setup-repository-directory-structure">Setup Repository Directory Structure</h2>

<p>While it is possible to manage external dependencies through <code>WORKSPACE</code>, Bazel loves monorepo. Thus, we are going to vendoring almost all our dependencies into our repository. The repository will be reorganized from a one-project centric layout to a monorepo layout.</p>

<h2 id="the-migration">The Migration</h2>

<h3 id="bazel-basics">Bazel Basics</h3>

<p>If you haven’t, now is a good time to read the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a>. We first setup an <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/5127262a28f77946908591fd176b90a8">ordinary <code>WORKSPACE</code> file</a> that has <code>rules_apple</code>, <code>rules_swift</code> and <code>xctestrunner</code> imported.</p>

<p>This will allow us to start to use <code>swift_library</code>, <code>swift_binary</code> and <code>ios_application</code> to quickly build iOS app using Bazel.</p>

<p>For Xcode integration, we use the <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/blob/master/src/tools/generate_xcodeproj.sh"><code>generate_xcodeproj.sh</code></a> script to create Xcode project with Tulsi. The <code>tulsiproj</code> however, was never checked into our repository. This keeps our Bazel <code>BUILD</code> file the only source of truth for our build configurations.</p>

<p>At this step, we exhausted what we learned from the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a> and need to face some real-world challenges.</p>

<h3 id="cocoapods-dependencies">CocoaPods Dependencies</h3>

<p>It is hard to avoid CocoaPods if you do any kind of iOS development. It is certainly not the best, but it has accumulated enough popularity that everyone has a <code>.podspec</code> file somewhere in their open-source repository. Luckily, there is the <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD">PodToBUILD</a> project from Pinterest to help alleviate the pain of manually converting a few CocoaPods dependencies to Bazel.</p>

<p>First, I use <code>pod install --verbose</code> to collect some information about the existing project’s CocoaPods dependency. <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/0bba51a54ef8b1308cf74ef0769f4f82">This script</a> is used to parse the output and generate <code>Pods.WORKSPACE</code> file that PodToBUILD want to use. We use the <code>bazel run @rules_pods//:update_pods</code> to vendoring CocoaPods dependencies into the repository.</p>

<p>Some dependencies such as Google’s Protobuf already have <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/BUILD">Bazel support</a>. After vendoring, we can switch from PodToBUILD generated one to the official one. Some of the dependencies are just static / dynamic binary frameworks. We can just use <code>apple_dynamic_framework_import</code> / <code>apple_static_framework_import</code>. Pure Swift projects support in PodToBUILD is something to be desired. But luckily, we can simply use <code>swift_library</code> for these dependencies. They usually don’t have complicated setup.</p>

<p>Some do. Realm is a mix of C++17, static libraries (<code>librealm.a</code>) and Swift / Objective-C sources. We can still use PodToBUILD utilities to help, and it is a good time to introduce <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/blob/master/doc/rules.md#swift_c_module"><code>swift_c_module</code></a> that can use <code>modulemap</code> file to create proper Swift imports.</p>

<p>The <strong>C++17</strong> portion is interesting because until this point, we used Bazel automatically created <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/toolchains.html">toolchains</a>. This toolchain, unfortunately, forced C++11 (at least for Bazel 3.4.1 on macOS 10.15). The solution is simple. You need to copy <code>bazel-$(YourProject)/external/local_config_cc</code> out into your own <code>common/bazel_tools</code> directory. Thus, we will no longer use the automatically generated toolchains configuration. You can modify C++11 to C++17 in the forked <code>local_config_cc</code> toolchain.</p>

<p>Here is what my <code>.bazelrc</code> looks like after CocoaPods dependencies migration:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-application">The Application</h3>

<p>If everything goes well, depending on how many CocoaPods dependencies you have, you may end up on day 3 or day 5 now. At this point, you can build each of your CocoaPods dependencies individually. It is time to build the iOS app with Bazel.</p>

<p>There actually aren’t many gotchas for building in the simulator. Following the <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-and-apple.html">Bazel guide for iOS</a> and set up your dependencies properly, you should be able to run the app inside the simulator.</p>

<p>If you have any bridging header (which you should avoid as much as possible!), you can add <code>["-import-objc-header". "$(location YourBridgingHeader.h)"]</code> to your <code>swift_library</code>’s <code>copts</code>.</p>

<p>To run the app from the device, it may need some extra work. First, Bazel needs you to tell it the exact location of provisioning files. I elected to store development provisioning files directly in <code>ios/ProvisioningFiles</code> directory. With more people, this may be problematic to update, since each addition of device or developer certificate requires a regeneration of provisioning files. Alternatively, you can manage them through <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane tools</a>.</p>

<p>iOS devices are often picky about the entitlements. Make sure you have the proper <code>application-identifier</code> key-value pair in your entitlements file.</p>

<p>If you use Xcode, now is a good time to introduce the <code>focus.py</code> script. This script will take a Bazel target, and generate / open the Xcode project for you. It is a good idea to have such a script to wrap around <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/blob/master/src/tools/generate_xcodeproj.sh"><code>generate_xcodeproj.sh</code></a>. You will inevitably need some light modifications around the generated Xcode project or scheme files beyond what Tulsi is capable of. <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuliu/ccbbfe94fed7bfe07148a6ffd200b06e">Here is mine</a>.</p>

<p>You can use such script like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>./focus.py ios/Apps/Project:Project
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="dynamic-frameworks">Dynamic Frameworks</h4>

<p><code>rules_apple</code> in 04/2020 <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/issues/746">introduced a bug that won’t codesign dynamic frameworks properly</a>. It is not a big deal for people that have no dynamic framework dependency (you should strive to be that person!). For many mortals, this is problematic. Simply switching to <code>rules_apple</code> prior to that commit will fix the issue.</p>

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

<p>Bazel, as it turns out, has fantastic support for simulator-based tests. I still remember the days to debug Buck issues around hosted unit tests and alike.</p>

<p>Many projects may start with something called <em>Hosted Tests</em> in the Xcode world. It is quick and dirty. With <em>Hosted Tests</em>, you have full access to UIKit, you can even write fancy <a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing">SnapshotTesting</a>. However, now is a good time for you to separate your tests out into two camps: a library test and a hosted test.</p>

<p>A library test in Bazel is a <code>ios_unit_test</code> without <code>test…</code></p></div></div>

<p>A few years back, I did some work for a sensor network startup. Since then, I’ve always been on the lookout for new sensor hardware and tools. I just moved into a new apartment, and discovered the VegeHub when searching for soil moisture sensors to use on my flower boxes.</p>

<p>The VegeHub supports sending your data to a few online storage providers (a.k.a <em>The Cloud</em>), or to a custom web service. I considered adding support to <a href="https://bigsense.io/">BigSense</a>, a sensor web service I wrote in <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/video/big-sense-rest-web-services-in-scala-for-sensor-networks-wellington-java-user-group/">Scala</a>. Instead, I decided it would be a good time to experiment with a time series database. I wrote a small Python Flask application called <a href="https://gitlab.com/djsumdog/senseflux">SenseFlux</a> to store VegeHub data in InfluxDB. In this post, I’ll show you how you can setup SenseFlux and InfluxDB using <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/my-love-hate-relationship-with-docker-and-container-orchestration-systems/">Docker</a>, and graph sensor data using chronograf. Let’s get started.</p>

</figure>

<p>The VegeHub’s web interface allows you to set a custom web service endpoint, an API Key and a Channel ID. The Channel ID is what SenseFlux will use to identify the sensor data and store it InfluxDB. SenseFlux will also use the API key for validation.</p>

<p>SenseFlux is a Python application which uses <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> for its application framework and <a href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/">Waitress</a> for its web server. It can accept data from a VegeHub sent to the <code>/create/vghub</code> endpoint. The data is stored in InfluxDB and can be viewed using tools like Chronograf. The easiest way to get started is to run these components in Docker containers. The following establishes a Docker network and then creates the appropriate containers for InfluxDB and SenseFlux, exposing the SenseFlux port on the host machine.</p>

<pre>docker network create sensenet

docker run -d --name influx-sf --network sensenet \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER=influx \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; \
    -v influx-state:/var/lib/influxdb \
    influxdb

docker run -d --name senseflux-sf --network sensenet -p 8003:8003 \
    -e SF_API_KEY=TESTKey \
    -e INFLUXDB_HOST=influx-sf \
    -e INFLUXDB_USER=influx \
    -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; battlepenguin/senseflux:v0.0.9 \
    -e FIELD1=Humidity \
    -e FIELD2=SoilTemperature \
    -e FIELD3=SoilMoisture \
    -e FIELD4=Darkness
    -e FIELD5=Battery

</pre>

<p>In the above example, create a secure password for <code>&lt;SecurePassword&gt;</code>, and set each field input to the appropriate sensor type. Ensure the <code>SF_API_KEY</code> matched what’s configured on the VegeHub. Fields that are not defined will default to the type <code>Voltage</code>, scaling the range of 0.0 to 3.0 volts to a number between 0 and 100.</p>

<p>The VegeHub Wi-Fi was the most expensive component of this setup at $140. It comes with firmware that has a web interface for configuration. It’s not a general purpose device and the software on it is closed source and proprietary.</p>

<p>For comparison, a Raspberry Pi or Beagle Bone would be between $35 ~ $65 depending on the model. Single Board Computers (SBCs) are more general purpose devices, and would need <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/video/ltsense-using-embedded-python-for-sensor-networks-wellington-python-user-group/">additional software</a> and configuration to become a sensor relay. SBCs also consume considerably more power, would not run nearly as long with similar batteries, and additional hardware would be needed to turn the device on and off at regular intervals to read sensor data in order to conserve battery. Embedded hardware like an Arduino might be a more comparable device when it comes to storage and power consumption.</p>

  <figcaption>
      

      Inside of VegeHub Wi-Fi Module

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The built in Wi-Fi is unable to see 5Ghz wireless access points, so you must have a <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/building-a-thin-itx-router/">Wi-Fi router</a> that supports either 2.4Ghz or dual 2.4Ghz/5Ghz configurations. The range of its Wi-Fi is not very good. I had to move my router about a meter closer to my balcony so the VegeHub could make reliable connections. Sometimes it would stop reporting for hours and I’d have to open the case, just so it could establish a reliable signal. I do live in an apartment, so there may be noise and interference issues. It can store 64 samples per channel in the event it can’t communicate with SenseFlux. If you use the default sample rate of 5 minutes, it can cache about five and a half hours worth of samples.</p>

<p>The VegeHub supports transmitting data over SSL/TLS, but it only appears to have certificates for the major hosting providers it supports. I could not get the VegeHub to send data to an instance of SenseFlux secured by LetsEncrypt certificates. I suspect the limited storage on the VegeHub doesn’t allow for it to have many of the standard certificate authorities found in most operating systems and web browsers. Their website does have instructions for flashing your own certificates via its USB interface, however I didn’t attempt this myself.</p>

<figure>

      VegeHub Wi-Fi, Battery Box and Sensors

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The VegeHub has minimal setup and can start logging data to one of its supported cloud providers right out of the box. It does provide an easy way to collect sensor, however the software lacks useful error messages via the web interface. If I were making suggestions to the VegeHub engineers, I’d suggest the following feature set in their next release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>External waterproof Wi-Fi antenna</li>
  <li>More on-board storage</li>
  <li>Better diagnostics via the web interface</li>
  <li>Include all standard SSL certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with these limitations, the VegeHub is still an okay solution. Be sure you have a powerful Wi-Fi access point very close to the device, and change the defaults to a higher refresh interval, in order to minimize data loss.</p>

<h3 id="chronograf">Chronograf</h3>

<p>You can use the following to launch a Chronograf container to read and graph data out of InfluxDB.</p>

<pre>docker run --name chronograf-sf --network sensenet -p 8888:8888 \
  -v chronograf-state:/var/lib/chronograf \
  -e INFLUXDB_URL=http://influx-sf:8086 \
  -e INFLUXDB_USERNAME=influx \
  -e INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=&lt;SecurePassword&gt; \
  chronograf
</pre>

<p>This will expose a web interface at port 8888, which can be used to create graphs and dashboards. The following is a dashboard I created for the VegeHub Sensors.</p>

      Sensor Graphs from July 30th to August 7th 2020

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>The soil temperature, humidity and light saturation sensors returned reasonable data and pretty much work as expected. The battery sensor has fewer data points as it’s only recorded whenever the VegeHub sends data. I’m assuming it is a simple voltage sensor, which can vary due to the temperature of the batteries.</p>

<p>At first, the soil moisture sensor seemed to continually send a voltage of 3.3, which turned into a reading of 109%. It was recording 0 when it wasn’t in my flower box, so I thought there may have been a short. After repositioning the sensor, I started to get readings between 7% to 9%. I don’t have another soil moisture sensor to compare it to, so I’m not sure how accurate the readings are.</p>

<h3 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h3>

<p>In my <a href="https://bigsense.io/">previous sensor network project</a>, I created a web service that could use either MySQL, Postgres or Microsoft SQL as a data storage backend. SenseFlux is my first attempt at using a time series database. An early bug in SenseFlux caused data to be stored as strings instead of floats<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and InfluxDB doesn’t allow for changing a schema or casing from strings back to numeric types<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. I ended up having to export the entire database and write a script to reload the data. During my development process, I discovered the following InfluxDB limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schema cannot be modified once created</li>
  <li>No ability to delete specific old or invalid records</li>
  <li>Old data is only deleted if it’s configured to expire</li>
</ul>

<p>InfluxDB has very specific use cases for reading measures from hundreds or thousands of sensors at high intervals. It’s commonly found in devops applications for monitoring data from virtual machines, such as CPU and disk space usage. It’s also used for storing readings from sensors in data centers, such as cabinet temperature or network switch throughput. It works well in situations where old data needs to expire at regular intervals, but it may not be the best tool for measuring inputs from environmental sensors, which tend to have much lower sample rates. InfluxDB may be better suited for large deployments of agriculture sensors.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>This was a fun project. I got to try out a new device, write some code and create some pretty graphs. I’d be hesitant to recommend the VegeHub at this point, due to the Wi-Fi connectivity, firmware limitations and data transmission issues. However, I think the device is a good idea and consumers need more products that allow their data to be processed by a variety of services, as well as the ability to keep and host the data themselves. <a href="https://gitlab.com/djsumdog/senseflux">SenseFlux</a> is a simple example of how to write middleware that can transform sensor data, so it can be stored and viewed with a variety of existing open source tools.</p>

If you’ve used Snap Search, you’ll find lots of banners and vector images used throughout the app. However, it comes with a very obvious risk: loading large images can slow down your app, and increase the apk size. I have a <strong><em>total 321 files in the drawable folder</em></strong> for Snap Search, and the following method is my easy trick to reduce APK size on Android.</p> <p>For those who are in a hurry and just want to know it quickly, these are the steps I follow:</p><ul><li>Save your image as a .png file</li><li>Compress your image using <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a></li><li>Add the compressed image to your drawable folder</li><li>Right click on file, select ‘Convert o WebP’</li></ul><p>This whole process, on an average compresses the image by almost 80-90%. The images do NOT lose any quality at all, and your UI is still snappy and responsive to load and use.</p><p>Let’s check an example:</p><h2>Example to Reduce APK Size</h2><p>Here’s an example of an image in Snap Search, highlighting one of the premium features ( <a href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/">there are quite a few</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is a condensed version of part of the second chapter, which focuses on the history of lockdowns and how they became government policy. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The entire booklet is available on Amazon at https://amzn.to/33reYrm and at iBooks at https://apple.co/2PoNhqI.</p>

<p>By Alex Berenson</p>
<p>In March, as the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic jumped to Europe and the United States, epidemiologists and public health experts told governments to lock down – fast and hard. Not just mass gatherings, but schools, offices, malls, even parks and beaches. To do anything less would be to sentence millions of people to death, the experts said.</p>
<p>Most infamously, the Imperial College London report of March 16 – written by researchers who were working with the World Health Organization – predicted more than 2 million American coronavirus deaths without immediate action. It called for a policy of what Professor Neil Ferguson, the report’s lead author, termed “suppression”:</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>(Of course, Professor Ferguson exempted himself from his mandate. Two weeks after the report came out, as the entire United Kingdom had locked down, and <em>while Ferguson himself was still supposed to be self-isolating after contracting the coronavirus, </em>he had an affair with a married woman who traveled across London to meet him.)</p>
<p>The stunning impact of the Imperial College report made Ferguson arguably the most important public health expert in the world. Yet he was neither physician nor virologist. His PhD was in theoretical physics, arguments about the structure of the universe that are something close to pure math.</p>
<p>But he and the other Imperial College researchers appeared to believe a handful of relatively simple equations would predict the coronavirus epidemic. At their core, these models are simply software programs designed to simulate reality, based on the assumptions that the person who creates them inputs into them. They are as realistic as a game of SimCity, though less colorful.</p>
<p>Nonethless, Ferguson’s model produced highly precise answers. Lockdowns could reduce coronavirus deaths 95 percent if they continued until a vaccine was developed. Ferguson and his team even offered different death projections based on the severity of the lockdowns and benchmarks used to lift and reinstate them.</p>
<p>These details gave the Imperial College model an undeserved sense of certainty and reliability. In this sense, they were like other mathematical simulations of real-world events – like the ones that helped fuel the 2008 housing and financial meltdown.</p>
<p>But for all the complexity of his equations, Ferguson really offered nothing more than an updated version of the original frightened rationale for the quarantines European city-states had imposed during the Black Death seven centuries earlier: <em>Keep strangers away and we’ll be safe.</em></p>

<p>The idea of using widespread lockdowns to slow epidemics took off in 2006, as The New York Times reported in April. After a flu scare in 2005, then-President George W. Bush asked scientists for research on slowing epidemics. Dr. Carter Mecher, an internist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, connected with Robert Glass, a computer scientist at Sandia National Laboratories.</p>
<p>For a science project, Glass’s 14-year-old daughter had created a model of the way social distancing might slow the spread of the flu<em>. </em>Glass built on it to create a simulation “proving” lockdowns could reduce an influenza epidemic in a hypothetical town of 10,000 people by 90 percent. “Dr. Mecher received the results at his office in Washington and was amazed,” the Times wrote.</p>
<p>Robert and Laura Glass ultimately became the first two authors on a paper about the simulation. Inevitably, it contained a shout-out to Neil Ferguson. And sure enough, it showed the “mitigation strategies” worked.</p>
<p>In the retelling of this heroic lockdowns-for-all story by the Times, the conclusions of the paper took the CDC by storm. “In February 2007, the C.D.C. made their approach – bureaucratically called Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions, or NPIs – official U.S. policy.”</p>
<p>The reality was different.</p>
<p>The 2007 CDC paper ran 108 pages and included descriptions of many ways to reduce transmission, from “voluntary isolation of ill adults” to “reducing density in public transit.” (<a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425">https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11425</a>)</p>
<p>Crucially, it also contained a “Pandemic Severity Index” that included five categories. On the low end, Category 1 represented a normal seasonal flu season, which still might kill up to 90,000 Americans. On the high end, a Category 5 pandemic, like the Spanish flu, would kill at least 1.8 million Americans.</p>
<p>Based on the CDC’s scale, Sars-Cov-2 almost certainly should be classified as Category 2 epidemic, meaning it will cause between 90,000 and 450,000 deaths. For an epidemic like that, the CDC merely said governments should <em>consider</em> school closures of less than four weeks, along with moderate efforts to reduce contacts among adults, such as telecommuting.</p>
<p>The prospect of closing all retail stores or offices <em>is not even mentioned in the paper, </em>not even for the most severe epidemics.</p>
<p>Yet the Times glossed over these distinctions in its article. It wrote instead “the (Bush) administration ultimately sided with the proponents of social distancing and shutdowns” and claimed the coronavirus response came directly from the original CDC report. “Then the coronavirus came, and the plan was put to work across the country for the first time.”</p>

<p>Even as the CDC was putting its 2007 plan together, many scientists and physicians with expertise in treating pandemics worried about the weakness of real-world evidence for lockdowns and other interventions.</p>
<p>Among the most vocal critics of lockdowns was Dr. Donald Henderson, who led the successful effort to eradicate smallpox. In December 2006, Henderson and three others wrote an 11-page paper called “Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza.” After outlining potential lockdown measures, they wrote, “We must ask whether any or all of the proposed measures are epidemiologically sound… [and] consider possible secondary social and economic impacts.”</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bsp.2006.4.366?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bsp.2006.4.366?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;</a>)</p>
<p>Efforts in past epidemics to slow – much less stop – the spread of the flu had largely failed, the authors wrote. They attacked quarantines, travel bans, and school closings of more than two weeks as likely counterproductive. They did not even mention full lockdowns, presumably because they viewed those as so unlikely. And near the end of the paper, they made a heartfelt plea:</p>
<p>Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted.</p>
<p>In 2020, their warning went unheeded.</p>

  <div>
    <p>So far everything we’ve done with breakpoints involved us creating a breakpoint file and using this
to automate part of a track. Now we’ll take a look at how we can take an existing track and extract
some breakpoints from this. For this post, we’ll take a look at extracting the amplitudes from the
.wave files, as this is one of the most straightforward properties that we can extract.</p>
<p>There is nothing here that we’ve not seen in the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/tags/goaudio/">previous
posts</a>, but rather we are going to combine what we’ve
already learned to create a new tool to do this.</p>
<p>In a high level overview, we’ll have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate over our frames</li>
<li>record the given amplitude (frame value)</li>
<li>write to breakpoint file</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence this would be simple enough, but we’ll make two small modifications to this
algorithm. First of all, we don’t want to just generate a breakpoint for each frame, this would just
result in a list that is equal to our frame data. We’ll use less space by just taking a snapshot at
a certain interval, e.g every 10ms, and take advantage of
our linear interpolation that happens when looking up the value of a breakpoint at a certain time.</p>
<p>A small extention to our current breakpoint code is that we need to be able to ‘batch’ the samples
into slices of a given time.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the code, everything can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/cmd/extractbrk/main.go">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The BatchSamples function will take a <code>Wave</code> and <code>seconds float64</code> as input, as this gives us enough
data to batch the frames. Given a certain SampleRate, we know how many Samples per Second we are
seeing in the file. With this information, we can find the amount of Frames per Seconds. Although
frames per second is only equal to the samples per second for mono files, but adapting for
multi-channel audio is just a matter of multiplying the SampleSize by the amount of channels.</p>
<p>The SampleSize can thus be expressed as follows: <code>SampleSize = SampleRate * Channels * seconds</code></p>
<p>When we know our sample size, we can split the raw frames into slices of this size.</p>

<p>Once we can split our frames into batches, we can call <code>BatchSamples(wave,x)</code> to get the requested
batches of a given duration. Then, we can find the max amplitude over all of these and keep
track of this over all batches.</p>
<p>The setup code is the same as usual, where we parse an input file with
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. Except that now we’ll also send the frames to the
‘BatchSamples’ function. (Error handling ignored for brevity)</p>

<p>When we run this program <code>go run main.go -i input.wav -w 15 -o output.brk</code> we can generate a
breakpoint file. I’ve created a sample waveform (something I’ll write a future blogpost about) with
variable amplitude. You can listen to it <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/input.wav">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extracted breakpoint file can be seen <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/output.brk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using audacity and your favourite plotting tool you can compare the waveform with what the
breakpoint extractor generated.</p>

Snubbing another person in favor of your phone is called <em>phubbing</em> (phone + snubbing) and it is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300704" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">common complaint in relationships</a>. <em>Phubbing your partner is called Pphubbing or Partner phubbing and research acknowledges that it worsens relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction, and could also add to depression.</em></p><h2><span id="What_is_phone_addiction">What is phone addiction?</span></h2><p>Let’s first understand what is phone addiction and what counts as excessive phone use. Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way.</p><p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can become an addiction in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p><p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1" alt="Phone addiction" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div><h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3><p><strong>There is no cut-off point for phone use which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p><ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li></ol><h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3><ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (Chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol><h2><span id="Fast_facts_about_phone_and_internet_use">Fast facts about phone and internet use</span></h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone.

That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p><p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction.

As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p><h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. However, breaking a habit means you have to change how those neurons behave and the only way to do that is to ensure a change in the neural circuit. You can do that by changing 3 things:</p><ul><li><strong>The context in which the habit occurs</strong> – Identify how your mood is when you get into the phone-use black hole and do an activity that changes the mood. Instead of sitting and scrolling, start cleaning up or begin work, and occasionally take a phone break.</li><li><strong>Interrupting the trigger that kick-starts the habit</strong> – Identify the triggers and immediately distract yourself, change the room, go for a bath, etc.</li><li><strong>The verbal narrative about that habit</strong> – Change your self-talk about phone addiction. For example, change “I need to use my phone, I want to do that right now” to “I can use a strategy to use my phone in a limited way so I don’t stay an addict and still enjoy it.”</li></ul><p>For example – If you have a habit of staring at your phone right after writing an email,&nbsp;<strong>change the context</strong>&nbsp;by doing a physical stretch.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt the trigger</strong>&nbsp;by clicking send and then switching off your phone immediately. And&nbsp;<strong>change the narrative</strong>&nbsp;by telling yourself something like “<em>The email was not the end of my work, I can start another task and then go on Instagram.</em>” Even if this just delays your phone use by a few minutes, it’s progress.</p><h3><span id="3_Introspect_about_your_expectations">3.&nbsp;<strong>Introspect about your expectations</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Continuous short-interval phone checking may …</p></div></div>

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3
</li></ul><p>Some tools to check out include:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex">LiteX</a> - A Python-based SoC builder
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/litex-hub">LiteX Hub</a> - collaborative FPGA projects based on LiteX
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv">LiteX-BuildEnv</a> - An environment for building LiteX-based FPGA designs

</li><li><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">nextpnr</a> - a vendor neutral, timing driven place and route tool
</li><li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/">SymbiFlow</a> - an umbrella project for FPGA architecture definitions
</li></ul><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mithro">Tim 'mithro' Ansell</a> has an open offer to send FPGA hardware to anyone who has time to to contribute to open source FPGA projects but doesn't have any hardware.
</p>

<h4>Xilinx</h4>
<h5>Zynq</h5>
<p>Xilinx's Zynq parts are supported by their Vivado high level synthesis design suite and include a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9, USB 2.0, and Gigabit Ethernet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>It has been a year since I left social media. It was difficult to do at the time, and I kept finding excuses and reasons not to. Looking back I realise it was because I was an addict. I was addicted to the scrolling, the likes, the unlimited content.</p>
<p>I was addicted to social media in the same way I was addicted to cigarettes. I wasn’t a heavy social media user (or smoker for that matter), but I knew that it wasn’t in my best interests. I knew that it was clever capitalism that kept me on my leash, and I knew that it was robbing me of my time and my physical and mental health. But it was there with me every day. It never made me feel any better, yet I still spent time and energy on it.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to quit using social media, and few to remain connected. The switch flicked as I posted a picture of a gorgeous sunset on Instagram. I was showing off to the world how beautiful my life is, while at the same time knowing it was a false representation at that moment. At the time I was mildly depressed and hungry and cold. Did I want people to admire me right there and then? Why was I doing this?</p>
<p>The year since has been great. It’s not a huge change. Things have just regained their natural cadence. When I meet up with friends I haven’t seen in a while, we have lots to discuss since we don’t have a constant feed of one another’s lives on our smartphones. My relationships deepened as they became more intentional. It was easy to feel like I was keeping in touch when I was on social media, even though there was no conversation happening. No relationship being nurtured.</p>
<p>And finally, this has been by far the most productive year of my life. I’ve taught at an accelerator in Ghana and a university in Cape Town. I’ve started 3 projects, <a href="https://justsketch.me/">one</a> of which turned into a business that allowed me to quit my job and live a much freer life. <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Another</a> became a lovely open-sourced platform of which the ethos is dear to my heart. I've built little <a href="https://herman_the_merman.itch.io/">games</a> and played with interesting ideas.</p>
<p>The combination of productivity, but also mindful leisure has made the past year delightful. In my free time, I read books and spend time with people who are important to me. I play and exercise and don’t keep up with the Joneses. I spend time in the mountains or on beaches, and the whole world doesn’t need to know. In a fundamental way, quitting social media has made me more free.</p>

<p>Press Release No. 61/2020 of 17 July 2020</p>
<p>Order of 27 May 2020 - <a href="https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2020/05/rs20200527_1bvr187313.html;jsessionid=F2F1E559320362AA64868B6B581BB9DF.1_cid383" title="Beschluss vom 27. Mai 2020">1 BvR 1873/13, 1 BvR 2618/13</a> (Subscriber data II)</p>
<p>In an order published today, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional § 113 of the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz – TKG) and several ordinary federal laws, which govern the manual procedure for obtaining information on subscriber data. They violate the complainants’ right to informational self-determination and their right to the privacy of telecommunications (Art. 10(1) of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz – GG). The complainants are subscribers of telecommunications and internet services. The manual information procedure enables security authorities to obtain information from telecommunications enterprises, in particular, information on subscribers of telecommunications services or an IP address assigned at a certain point in time. The information that is provided includes personal customer data that is linked to the conclusion or performance of a contract (so-called subscriber data). Information on data that relates to the use of telecommunications services (so-called traffic data) and the actual content of telecommunications is not provided.<br>
In principle, providing information on subscriber data is permissible under constitutional law. Yet, similar to the image of a double-door, the legislature must create a proportionate legal basis for both the transfer of subscriber data by telecommunications providers and the retrieval of such data by the authorities. Provisions on transferring and retrieving data must adequately limit the purposes of the utilisation of data, particularly by establishing thresholds for the use of powers as part of the constituent elements of the provision and by providing for sufficiently meaningful protection of legal interests. The First Senate clarified that, in principle, despite the moderate weight of the interference, using the general powers to transfer and retrieve subscriber data in the context of maintaining public security and the activities of intelligence services requires there to be a specific danger in the individual case, and an initial suspicion of criminal conduct (Anfangsverdacht) in the context of the investigation and prosecution of offences. Where dynamic IP addresses are matched, this must additionally serve to protect or legally reinforce legal interests of at least considerable weight given the increased weight of the interference. Where, with regard to maintaining public security or activities of intelligence services, the thresholds for the use of powers require less than a specific danger, this must be compensated for by establishing stricter requirements for the weight of the legal interests meriting protection. For the most part, the challenged provisions did not satisfy these requirements. For the rest, the First Senate again held that information on login details may be provided only if the statutory requirements for its use are met.</p>

<p><strong>Facts of the case:</strong></p>

<p>§ 113 TKG permits the transfer of subscriber data by telecommunications providers in the context of a so-called manual information procedure. The other challenged provisions govern the retrieval of such data by various federal security authorities, such as the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the Federal Police Office (Bundespolizei) and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz). The challenged provisions were all aimed at implementing the Federal Constitutional Court’s decision of 24 January 2012 (Subscriber data I), in which the Court had declared parts of § 113 TKG, as it stood then, to be unconstitutional and had objected to the lack of ordinary law provisions on data retrieval. <br>
Telecommunications providers provide information pursuant to § 113 TKG at the request of one of the security authorities listed in § 113 TKG. Pursuant to § 113(1) first sentence TKG, the information that must be provided encompasses subscriber data such as the subscriber’s name, date of birth and phone number that must be retained as well as customer data which, pursuant to § 95 TKG, is retained voluntarily by the telecommunications providers for operational purposes. This usually includes the subscriber’s address, the type of the service as provided in the contract and other data such as their bank details.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(1) second sentence TKG, information must also be provided on login details like personal identification numbers (PIN) assigned by the telecommunications provider. By contrast, telecommunications providers usually only save passwords created by users themselves in an encrypted format. Thus, no information can be provided thereon.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(1) third sentence TKG, subscriber data may also be determined on the basis of an IP address that has been assigned at a specific point in time (dynamic IP address). The information that is provided includes the IP address matched to a specific subscriber and thus also forms part of the subscriber data. This is only possible where telecommunications providers analyse previously retained traffic data in order to identify the subscriber to whom the used IP address was assigned at the point in time specified in the request.<br>
Pursuant to § 113(2) first sentence TKG, information may be provided only if one of the authorities listed in § 113(3) TKG requests such information for the purpose of the investigation and prosecution of criminal or administrative offences, for averting dangers to the public order or security, or for performing the tasks conferred upon intelligence services under statutory law. In its request, the authority must state the provision that authorises data retrieval. <br>
The provisions on data retrieval challenged in the constitutional complaints set out that security authorities may request information on subscriber data from telecommunications providers. In essence, the provisions require only that the authorities need the information in order to perform their tasks. With respect to information on login details, the provisions imply that the statutory requirements for the use of such data are met. The provisions also permit requesting information on subscriber data that is determined on the basis of a dynamic IP address. The Federal Criminal Police Office, the Federal Police Office, the Customs Criminal Investigations Office (Zollkriminalamt) and the federal intelligence services are authorised to make such requests.</p>

<p><strong>Key considerations of the Senate:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I. In substantive terms, the challenged powers to transfer data under § 113 TKG do not satisfy the constitutional requirements that follow from the general right of personality deriving from Art. 2(1) in conjunction with Art. 1(1) GG and the privacy of telecommunications guaranteed by Art. 10(1) GG. It is true that these powers serve legitimate purposes – increasing the effectiveness of investigating and prosecuting offences, of maintaining public security, and of performing the tasks of the intelligence services. However, the provisions on the transfer of data are only compatible with the requirements of proportionality in its stricter sense if they limit the purposes for which these powers may be used with sufficient legal clarity.<br>
1. The powers laid down in § 113(1) first sentence TKG to request information on subscriber data in general does not satisfy these requirements.<br>
a) § 113(1) first sentence TKG permits requests for information on subscriber data in general; this amounts to an interference with the right to informational self-determination. Even though the interference is not of great weight, the challenged powers to transfer data are disproportionate because of their scope. It cannot be permissible to indiscriminately request information on data, even if its significance and possible uses are very limited. Thus, thresholds that limit the use of these powers are required; these thresholds must ensure that information can be obtained only if factual circumstances provide specific grounds for the use of these powers. Information that solely serves to facilitate the performance of the authority’s tasks in general may not be provided without specific grounds. The provision on data retrieval itself must set out thresholds for the use of these powers – this is the first door in the double door concept. In the context of maintaining public security and the activities of intelligence services, it is required that there be a specific danger in the specific case. In the context of the investigation and prosecution of offences, an initial suspicion is sufficient.<br>
However, under constitutional law, the legislature is not limited from the outset to establishing criteria for the use of powers that reflect the traditional security law approach to averting specific, imminent or present dangers. Rather, it can set wider limits by making requirements for foreseeability of the causal chain less strict under special circumstances. The legal basis for the use of powers must usually include the requirement that there be sufficient indications of a danger that is developing into being specific. For reasons stemming from the principle of proportionality, lowering the thresholds for the use of powers in such a manner is inextricably linked to increased requirements for the protection of specific legal interest; in this respect, regard must be had to the weight of the interference arising from the respective measure. Thus, interferences of lesser weight, such as requests for information on subscriber data in general might already be justified by a danger that is developing into being specific where the interferences serve to protect legal interest of at least considerable weight. <br>
In principle, these constitutional requirements apply to any authorisation to use powers with the aim of prevention and thus also to the utilisation of data by intelligence services. In this context, it …</p></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>I haven't met a developer who looked at a conflict message and did not pull their hair strands with frustration.</p><p>Trying to resolve each merge conflict is one of those things that every developer hates. Especially if it hits you when you're gearing up for a production deploy!</p><p>This is where having the right Git workflow set up can do a world of good for your <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/simple-software-development-workflow/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=git-workflow">development workflow</a>. </p><p>Of course, having the right git workflow will not solve all your problems. But it's a step in the right direction. After all, with every team working remotely, the need to build features together without having your codebase getting disrupted is critical.</p><p>How you set it up depends on the project you're working on, the release schedules your team has, the size of the team, and more!</p><p>In this article, we’ll walk you through 5 different git workflows, their benefits, their cons, and when you should use them. Let’s jump in!</p><h2 id="1-basic-git-workflow">1. Basic Git Workflow</h2><p>The most basic git workflow is the one where there is only one branch — the master branch. Developers commit directly into it and use it to deploy to the staging and production environment.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/Basic-git-workflow-3.png" alt="Basic Git Workflow"><figcaption>Basic Git Workflow with all commits getting added directly to master branch</figcaption></figure><p>This workflow isn’t usually recommended unless you’re working on a side project and you’re looking to get started quickly.</p><p>Since there is only one branch, there really is no process over here. This makes it effortless to get started with Git. However, some cons you need to keep in mind when using this workflow are:</p><ol><li>Collaborating on code will lead to multiple conflicts.</li><li>Chances of shipping buggy software to production is higher.</li><li>Maintaining clean code is harder.</li></ol><h2 id="2-git-feature-branch-workflow">2. Git Feature Branch Workflow</h2><p>The Git Feature Branch workflow becomes a must have when you have more than one developer working on the same codebase.</p><p>Imagine you have one developer who is working on a new feature. And another developer working on a second feature. Now, if both the developers work from the same branch and add commits to them, it would make the codebase a huge mess with plenty of conflicts.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/Feature-Branch-git-workflow-4.png" alt="Git feature branch workflow"><figcaption>Git workflow with feature branches</figcaption></figure><p>To avoid this, the two developers can create two separate branches from the master branch and work on their features individually. When they’re done with their feature, they can then merge their respective branch to the master branch, and deploy without having to wait for the second feature to be completed.</p><p>The Pros of using this workflow is, the git feature branch workflow allows you to collaborate on code without having to worry about code conflicts.</p><h2 id="3-git-feature-workflow-with-develop-branch">3. Git Feature Workflow with Develop Branch</h2><p>This workflow is one of the more popular workflows among developer teams. It’s similar to the Git Feature Branch workflow with a develop branch that is added in parallel to the master branch.</p><p>In this workflow, the master branch always reflects a production-ready state. Whenever the team wants to deploy to production they deploy it from the master branch.</p><p>The develop branch reflects the state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Developers create branches from the develop branch and work on new features. Once the feature is ready, it is tested, merged with develop branch, tested with the develop branch’s code in case there was a prior merge, and then merged with master.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/feature-branch-with-develop-git-workflow-2.png" alt="Git workflow with feature and develop branches"><figcaption>Git workflow with feature and develop branches</figcaption></figure><p>The advantage of this workflow is, it allows teams to consistently merge new features, test them in staging, and deploy to production. While maintaining code is easier, it can get a little tiresome for some teams since it can feel like going through a tedious process.</p><h2 id="4-gitflow-workflow">4. Gitflow Workflow</h2><p>The gitflow workflow is very similar to the previous workflow we discussed combined with two other branches — the release branch and the hot-fix branch.</p><h3 id="the-hot-fix-branch">The hot-fix branch</h3><p>The hot-fix branch is the only branch that is created from the master branch and directly merged to the master branch instead of the develop branch. It is used only when you have to quickly patch a production issue. An advantage of this branch is, it allows you to quickly deploy a production issue without disrupting others’ workflow or without having to wait for the next release cycle.</p><p>Once the fix is merged into the master branch and deployed, it should be merged into both develop and the current release branch. This is done to ensure that anyone who forks off develop to create a new feature branch has the latest code.</p><h3 id="the-release-branch">The release branch</h3><p>The release branch is forked off of develop branch after the develop branch has all the features planned for the release merged into it successfully.</p><p>No code related to new features is added into the release branch. Only code that relates the release is added to the release branch. For example, documentation, bug fixes, and other tasks related to this release are added to this branch.</p><p>Once this branch is merged with master and deployed to production, it’s also merged back into the develop branch, so that when a new feature is forked off of develop, it has the latest code.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/GitFlow-git-workflow-2.png" alt="Gitflow workflow"><figcaption>Gitflow workflow with hotfix and release branches</figcaption></figure><p>This workflow was first published and made popular by <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen</a> and since then it has been widely used by organizations that have a scheduled release cycle.</p><p>Since the git-flow is a wrapper around Git, you can install git-flow in your current repository. It's a straightforward process and it doesn't change anything in your repository other than creating branches for you. </p><p>To install on a Mac machine, execute <code>brew install git-flow</code> in your terminal.</p><p>To install on a Windows machine, you'll need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">download and install the git-flow</a>. After the installation is done, run <code>git flow init</code> to use it in your project.</p><h2 id="5-git-fork-workflow">5. Git Fork Workflow</h2><p>The Fork workflow is popular among teams who use open-source software.</p><p>The flow usually looks like this:</p><ol><li>The developer forks the open-source software’s official repository. A copy of this repository is created in their account.</li><li>The developer then clones the repository from their account to their local system.</li><li>A remote path for the official repository is added to the repository that is cloned to the local system.</li><li>The developer creates a new feature branch is created in their local system, makes changes, and commits them.</li><li>These changes along with the branch are pushed to the developer’s copy of the repository on their account.</li><li>A pull request from the branch is opened to the official repository.</li><li>The official repository’s manager checks the changes and approves the changes to get merged into the official repository.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="automating-your-git-workflows-for-better-productivity">Automating your Git Workflows for better productivity</h2><p>One of the things that developers have to constantly juggle with is updating their project management tool to keep their teammates updated. That’s why, at Zepel, our developers automate their workflow, so they can spend more of their time building the software.</p><p>Here’s how we automate our git workflow to keep everyone in sync:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/zepel-git-developer-workflow.png" alt="Developer Workflow with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack Integrations"><figcaption>A simple flowchart of how developer workflow is automated with GitHub, Zepel, and Slack</figcaption></figure><p>While Zepel integrates deeply with <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/github/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/bitbucket/">Bitbucket</a>, and <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/integrations/gitlab/">GitLab</a>, we use GitHub internally. So, once we’ve integrated GitHub with Zepel, our development team sets up the git workflow automation within Zepel. Here’s how it looks today:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/01/zepel-git-workflow-automation.png" alt="Git workflow automation"><figcaption>Automating Zepel to update statuses based on Git workflow.</figcaption></figure><p>As developers continue to make progress, our team automatically gets a Slack notification and their changes are recorded within the user story.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/image.png" alt="Git workflow updates to user story in real-time"><figcaption>Real-time updates on every commit, pull request, and branch changes.</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="your-own-workflow-">Your own workflow!</h2><p>The git workflows I’ve shown in this article are examples of some of the popular and best working workflows for the development team. Some teams create a branch for Staging and it works perfectly for them.</p><p>If you use other workflows that work well for you, tweet to us <a href="https://twitter.com/@getzepel">@getzepel</a>. We’d love to showcase them!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://zepel.io/?open_modal=true&amp;utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=bottom-cta&amp;utm_campaign=git-workflow"><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-template-cta.png" alt="development workflow cta button"></a></p><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>If you read a description of a static analysis in a paper, what might you find? There’ll be some cute model of a language. Maybe some inference rules describing the analysis itself, but those rules probably rely on a variety of helper functions. These days, the analysis likely involves some logical reasoning: about the terms in the language, the branches conditionals might take, and so on.</p>



<p>What makes a language good for implementing such an analysis? You’d want a variety of features:</p>



<ul><li>Algebraic data types to model the language AST.</li><li>Logic programming for cleanly specifying inference rules.</li><li>Pure functional code for writing the helper functions.</li><li>An SMT solver for answering logical queries.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~bembenek/">Aaron Bembenek</a>, <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Steve Chong</a>, and I have developed a design that hits the sweet spot of those four points: given Datalog as a core, you add constructors, pure ML, and a type-safe interface to SMT. If you set things up just right, the system is a powerful and ergonomic way to write static analyses.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a> is our prototype implementation of our design; our <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">paper on Formulog and its design</a> was just conditionally accepted to <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla">OOPSLA 2020</a>. To give a sense of why I’m excited, let me excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog/blob/master/examples/liquid_types.flg">simple liquid type checker</a>. Weighing in under 400 very short lines, it’s a nice showcase of how expressive Formulog is. (Our paper discusses substantially more complex examples.)</p>



<pre>type base =
&nbsp;&nbsp;| base_bool

type typ = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_tvar(tvar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_fun(var, typ, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_forall(tvar, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_ref(var, base, exp)

and exp = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(var)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(bool)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(op)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(var, typ, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(tvar, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(exp, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(exp, typ)
</pre>



<p>ADTs let you define your AST in a straightforward way. Here, <code>bool</code> is our only base type, but we could add more. Let’s look at some of the inference rules:</p>



<pre>(* subtyping *)
output sub(ctx, typ, typ)

(* bidirectional typing rules *)
output synth(ctx, exp, typ)
output check(ctx, exp, typ)

(* subtyping between refinement types is implication *)
sub(G, typ_ref(X, B, E1), typ_ref(Y, B, E2)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_ctx(G),
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_subst(Y, exp_var(X), E2) = E2prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_ctx(G, PhiG),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E1, Phi1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E2prime, Phi2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_valid(`PhiG /\ Phi1 ==&gt; Phi2`).

(* lambda and application synth rules *)
synth(G, exp_lam(X, T1, E), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_typ(G, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(ctx_var(G, X, T1), E, T2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_fun(X, T1, T2) = T.

synth(G, exp_app(E1, E2), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E1, typ_fun(X, T1, T2)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;check(G, E2, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E2, T2) = T.

(* the only checking rule *)
check(G, E, T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E, Tprime),
&nbsp;&nbsp;sub(G, Tprime, T).</pre>



<p>First, we declare our relations—that is, the (typed) inference rules we’ll be using. We show the most interesting case of subtyping: refinement implication. Several helper relations (<code>wf_ctx</code>, <code>encode_*</code>) and helper functions (<code>exp_subst</code>) patch things together. The typing rules below follow a similar pattern, mixing the <code>synth</code> and <code>check</code> bidirectional typing relations with calls to helper functions like <code>typ_subst</code>.</p>



<pre>fun exp_subst(X: var, E : exp, Etgt : exp) : exp =
&nbsp;&nbsp;match Etgt with
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(Y) =&gt; if X = Y then E else Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(Y, Tlam, Elam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Yfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh_for(Y, X::append(typ_freevars(Tlam), exp_freevars(Elam)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Elamfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y = Yfresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Elam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else exp_subst(Y, exp_var(Yfresh), Elam)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_lam(Yfresh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E, Tlam),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elamfresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(A, Etlam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tlam(A, exp_subst(X, E, Etlam))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(E1, E2) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_app(exp_subst(X, E, E1), exp_subst(X, E, E2))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(Etapp, T) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tapp(exp_subst(X, E, Etapp), typ_subst(X, E, T))
&nbsp;&nbsp;end</pre>



<p>Expression substitution might be boring, but it shows the ML fragment well enough. It’s more or less the usual ML, though functions need to have pure interfaces, and we have a few restrictions in place to keep typing simple in our prototype.</p>



<p>There’s lots of fun stuff that doesn’t make it into this example: not only can relations call functions, but functions can examine relations (so long as everything is stratified). Hiding inside <code>fresh_for</code> is a clever approach to name generation that guarantees freshness… but is also deterministic and won’t interfere with parallel execution. The <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> has more substantial examples.</p>



<p>We’re not the first to combine logic programming and SMT. What makes our design a sweet spot is that it doesn’t let SMT get in the way of Datalog’s straightforward and powerful execution model. Datalog execution is readily parallelizable; the magic sets transformation can turn Datalog’s exhaustive, bottom-up search into a goal-directed one. It’s not news that Datalog can turn these tricks—<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop/src/master/">Yiannis Smaragdakis has been saying it for years</a>!—but integrating Datalog cleanly with ML functions and SMT is new. Check out the <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> for a detailed related work comparison. While our design is, in the end, not so complicated, getting there was hard.</p>



<p>Relatedly, we have also have an <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/iclp2020_extabs.pdf">extended abstract at ICLP 2020</a>, detailing some experiments in using incremental solving modes from Formulog. You might worry that Datalog’s BFS (or heuristic) strategy wouldn’t work with an SMT solver’s push/pop (i.e., DFS) assertion stack—but a few implementation tricks and <code>check-sat-assuming</code> indeed provide speedups.</p>

<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_8b0a23dc03d84943adf8be09b08014a6/_image_cache/27c93597-70c8-465e-b77b-5b2eba72b047.jpg" width="640" height="427" data-action="zoom"></p>
<p>I was talking to a friend and recounting my experiences building multiple SaaS startups and why SaaS is generally a tough nut to break into. While I was talking to her, I started asking myself with the benefit of hindsight<span></span> <span>“</span>What would I do differently the next time?”. Here are a couple of things I would have done differently, irrespective of what I was building.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-the-price">Start with the price:</h2>
<p>This was the top-most thing that came to my mind when I asked that question, for a good reason. Price influences many things: Your customer segments, your retention, sales and renewal cycles and most importantly MRR/ARR. If you price something too high, you will need to come up with a significant differentiation w.r.t your lower priced competition. If you price something too low, you will need to go through motions of raising the prices slightly and risk drawing ire from your early users. What about Freemium? Better have a good reason for doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research, experiment and choose your price carefully!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="choose-who-you-let-in-and-out">Choose who you let in and out:</h2>
<p>Understanding and mapping this audience will help you understand how they influence your Sales and Product strategy. There are three major buckets you can divide your SaaS customers into: Significant Gainers, Outsourcers and Underserved segments. Significant Gainers are the accounts who will end up as a net-net <span>ROI</span> gainers. Outsourcers are typically large accounts &amp; have a good mapping with your offerings, they may end up outsourcing all of their headaches on to you. Underserved accounts are not completely sold by your offerings or there is a good lapse in the expectation, price or (worse) their <span>ROI</span>. It’s always a good idea to try and balance all of them in a way that you don’t become a service shop for your top 10-20% accounts and under-satisfy the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to map the <span>ROI</span>, their impact on your revenue and roadmaps before you onboard accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="break-down-the-journeys-and-map-them-to-specific-stakeholders">Break down the journeys and map them to specific stakeholders:</h2>
<p>Break the journeys down and map them to specific stakeholders. If you want to onboard accounts where the annual ticket sizes are more than 25K$+ spend some time here. Acquisitions of large accounts typically have four specific journeys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested/ Chase me,</li>
<li>Want to Evaluate,</li>
<li>Procurement,</li>
<li>Onboard Me (&amp; my problems).</li>
</ul>
<p>At every step of the way you will meet different POCs/Teams handholding &amp; influencing the specific journeys. Understand how other deals have gone through these stages and make it brain-dead simple. It seems obvious but in retrospect, this is mostly an after-thought and not the first thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimize to get to<span></span> <span>“</span>I need this now”,<span></span> <span>“</span>This looks good” and<span></span> <span>“</span>This is approved” mails as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="have-exit-interviews-at-both-evaluations-and-churned-stages.">Have exit interviews at both Evaluations and Churned stages.:</h2>
<p>When you build a tool that solves (one or more) problem(s), understand that there are a number of possible solutions. Understanding the market’s expectations continually can only happen if you ingest valid feedback at proper places. The most significant places are: Whenever demos/pitches happen, and whenever someone churns. Pitches are akin to coffee dates, sometimes they just don’t work out. Be prepared to get all sorts of feedback if done right. Existing accounts are like married couples and as with every failed marriage, the reasons are typically a mismatch in expectations or not being respected in the relationship. Try to solve for this before the dwindling bottom funnel becomes a problem!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Failed expectations typically end up in churns, so avoid it like the plague.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="have-strong-opinions-weakly-held">Have strong opinions weakly held:</h2>
<p>Intuition and Opinions will rarely ever take you far along the right path. Everyone (including me) has an opinion on making things work and building something. That doesn’t mean whatever works for you is wrong, learn to differentiate between signal and noise. But always remember when the map doesn’t match the territory the map is wrong. I wish I had listened to customers more than thought leaders and filtered signals from various noises. Be open to change at every step of the way - it’s the only way to grow. Look (upto) at companies that disrupt themselves or cannibalise themselves, as they can teach you a lot. Nothing is truly one-size fits all!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you make the same mistake twice, it’s not a mistake anymore, but a <a href="mailto:f@#kup">f@#kup</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is mostly a collection of stuff I messed up on, that doesn’t mean there will be a 1-1 mapping with whatever you are doing. Remember to have fun while building, &amp; ship stuff you are proud of!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>P.S: I would love to know more about what you think about the same? Also thanks to Bhavya for reviewing and suggesting edits to the early drafts for this post.</p>

<p><em>India’s first lunar mission, Chandrayaan 1, <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">confirmed the presence</a> of water on the Moon. It was a groundbreaking achievement for its Mission Director, Srinivasa Hegde, who worked at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for 36 years, from 1978 to 2014. At&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/u-r-rao-satellite-centre-ursc" target="_blank">ISRO’s Satellite Center</a> in Bangalore, he was involved in planning, analysis and operations for dozens of space missions.</em></p>



<p><em>I interviewed him for Supercluster on his role as Mission Director for Chandrayaan 1 and India’s future in space. The responses have been edited for clarity and some links and images have been added for the reader’s benefit.</em></p>



<hr>



<h5><strong>What first got you interested in space exploration?</strong></h5>



<p>As a kid, I was influenced by my grandfather. He was a Sanskrit scholar and an astrologer, with a love for stars in the sky. He used to take me for early morning walks before dawn. During those days of reduced pollution, many constellations were clearly visible. He used to identify and explain all the constellations to me and I was intrigued. Besides, I was generally interested in science and reading up on new discoveries and happenings in the field. Then one day I came across a job opening at ISRO for which I applied and got selected.</p>



<h5><strong><strong>Chandrayaan 1 was the first time India explored another world. What were the early stages of its conception like at ISRO?</strong></strong></h5>



<p>Dr. K. Kasturirangan, who chaired ISRO from 1994 to 2003, wanted the organization to play a small role in India’s ambition to become a superpower. This planted the seed for undertaking more ambitious missions. The idea of a Moon orbiter was floated around and was received positively by everyone.</p>



<p>At the time, ISRO already had satellites intended for geostationary applications which have plenty of fuel. So the basic infrastructure was ready and the only delta required was adapting it to the Moon. Initial calculations showed that our PSLV rocket was capable of giving an Earth-bound orbit beyond which the fuel on the spacecraft could be used to go to the Moon and perform orbital capture. In all, Chandrayaan 1 seemed like a logical extension of our capabilities.</p>



<h5><strong>What did your role as Chandrayaan 1’s Mission Director involve and what was your biggest challenge?</strong></h5>



<p>I was involved in all aspects of the Mission Design – the design of the various orbits, data management, orbit determination, strategies for mid-course corrections, etc. and also in aspects of operating the spacecraft.</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 was the first ISRO project to involve many foreigners who had their scientific instruments onboard. As Mission Director, I was tasked with accommodating their needs. It posed challenges because they had diverse requirements.</p>



<p>For instance, scientists behind the Mini-SAR payload wanted to calibrate the instrument when the spacecraft would be en-route to the Moon. They were unhappy with the fact that we couldn’t accommodate that due to certain changes in our launch schedule. However, at a later stage we provided them with a geometry in lunar orbit for calibration which they said was even better than what they originally asked for.</p>



<h5><strong>Was finding water on the Moon a primary scientific objective during the planning of Chandrayaan 1? Why was it important?</strong></h5>



<p>Absolutely. NASA missions to the Moon in the past decade had already hinted at the possibility of water ice being trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. So it was crucial to confirm its presence as it has implications for future human settlements as well as getting insights on <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>.</p>



<h5><strong>For Chandrayaan 1, ISRO solicited scientific instruments from other space agencies around the world. What was the driving philosophy behind that?</strong></h5>



<p>We had our own science payloads on Chandrayaan 1 but given the renewed global interest in the Moon after so many decades, we also wanted to provide the spacecraft as a platform for others. And so ISRO put out an announcement of opportunity to scientists all over the world to pitch payloads for Chandrayaan 1. We got instruments from ESA as well as NASA, including Universities associated with them. I think the timing of Chandrayaan 1 was good as NASA’s next Moon mapper, LRO, was still a year away.</p>



<h5><strong>Tell us about the <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water</a> on the Moon by the NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan 1 and more on the India-USA partnership.</strong></h5>



<p>As discussed, NASA scientists were really interested in putting their instruments on Chandrayaan 1 and working with us to confirm the presence of water. The discovery ultimately came from two NASA-built instruments – the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) and the Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3).</p>



<p>Mini-SAR <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">found</a> that more than 40 craters on the lunar poles reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice. However, there was still some uncertainty like in previous missions about the detections really being water ice.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It was the M3 instrument that <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">confirmed</a> water ice being present in the polar craters based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. In fact, M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon. Scientists now knew for the first time that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions.</p>

<p>The India-USA partnership on Chandrayaan 1 also extended to NASA providing us access to its iconic Deep Space Network which was used for communications with the spacecraft.</p>



<h5><strong>What was the most challenging scenario when operating Chandrayaan 1 in lunar orbit?</strong></h5>



<p>Oh, this is my favorite part! Chandrayaan 1 actually managed to view a solar eclipse from the Moon! We were able to see the Moon’s shadow cast on Earth. In 2009, a year after launch, both the star sensors onboard the spacecraft had failed. With that, the spacecraft lost its ability to precisely point to a desired attitude in space. A mission failure was looming.</p>



<p>Instead of losing the craft, we came up with a solution that involved using the Sun sensors to get knowledge of two spatial axes and take aid from the ground station to know the third. This data was utilized by the onboard gyroscopes to be able to point the spacecraft again with reasonable accuracy. The mission was back up and running.</p>



<p>As the spacecraft passed between the Moon and Earth in its lunar orbit on July 22, 2009, it imaged the Moon’s shadow cast on our planet. This was a first for any lunar mission and completely executed when the spacecraft was in a non-nominal state.</p>

Images credit: ISRO, GIF: Jatan Mehta</figcaption></figure></div>



<h5><strong>Do you think there’s enough water on the Moon’s poles to power large human settlements in the future?</strong></h5>



<p>It’s too early to comment but going by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">amount estimated</a> from Chandrayaan 1 Mini-SAR observations, it seems there could be enough. Chandrayaan 2’s orbiter can tell us more details about it.</p>



<h5><strong>How is the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter positioned to provide us more insights on water on the Moon?</strong></h5>



<p>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/chandrayaan2-payloads">upgraded instruments</a>. It’s infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and how the amount changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The upgraded radar, that can penetrate deeper, will map the water ice trapped in the lunar poles and quantify its amount, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h5><strong>How can India compete with China and the USA in the renewed Moon race?</strong></h5>



<p>It is difficult as both these nations have enormous resources. But the spectrum of science that can be done on the Moon is vast and our strategy has been to fill crucial gaps in our current understanding, like the discovery of water.</p>



<h5><strong>Which planetary destination do you think India should aim for next and why?</strong></h5>



<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It&nbsp;is mostly covered with fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies in the Solar System and is known to host water underneath that icy surface. After Cassini spacecraft’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-organic-compounds-found-in-enceladus-ice-grains">discovery of organic compounds</a> in Enceladus’ plumes, it has become, to me, by far the most interesting object in the Solar System.</p>



<h5><strong>What does having a planetary exploration program mean for a country like India?</strong></h5>



<p>It plays an important role in eventual settlement of space. Doing such missions means we gain new capabilities and experiences, all of which give us a good starting point for future endeavors. For instance, the most notable thing in Chandrayaan 2 is that all of its cutting-edge scientific instruments are designed and built indigenously.</p>



<h5><strong>What are your thoughts on India sending its own astronauts to space, aka the Gaganyaan program?</strong></h5>



<p>Sending humans to space involves too many challenges, like ruggedization of the spacecraft and launcher, having enough fuel at all stages, complex trajectories, multi-layered redundancy in spacecraft functions, etc. At every stage, there should be a means to get back humans safely and there is little to no tolerance for failure. With all those requirements, Gaganyaan is certainly a very expensive undertaking. But it has to be done sooner or later for space settlement, so why not now?</p>



<h5><strong>Throughout your career at ISRO, how have you seen the landscape for women in STEM change?</strong></h5>



<p>There are many <a href="https://jatan.space/book-review-those-magnificent-women-and-their-stories/">women at ISRO</a> who are capable and doing exceptional work. Over the years they have rightly assumed increasingly higher and more versatile positions inside ISRO’s various missions and centers. This includes women who aren’t necessarily photogenic and don’t feel the need to be in the limelight.</p>



<h5><strong>Should humanity establish permanent presence on the Moon first or Mars?</strong></h5>

<![CDATA[The wrong way to filter sockets with BPF]]>
            </title>

August 8, 2020 | https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Here is a bug that everyone who uses BPF to filter packets on Linux eventually encounters:  you create a socket, use setsockopt to apply a BPF, and then read from the socket using recv. You read a packet that does <strong>not</strong> match the filter but was received from the socket anyway. The bug only happens when there is a lot of traffic and even then it only occurs when the application first starts. What is happening?</p>

<p>Here is some code which suffers from this issue. Error-handling has been removed for conciseness:</p>

<pre><code>int sock = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));

struct sock_filter bpf_bytecode[] = { ... }; // bytecode generated by hand or using "tcpdump -dd"
struct sock_fprog bpf_program = { sizeof(bpf_bytecode) / sizeof(bpf_bytecode[0]), bpf_bytecode};
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));

char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will sometimes contain a packet that doesn't match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>The bug here is deceptively simple: Packets are filtered when they are received by the kernel <strong>not</strong> when they are read by user-mode using recv. Therefore packets which don’t match the BPF can be received after the socket is created and before setsockopt is called. Those packets will remain in the socket’s buffer even after the BPF is applied and will later be transferred to the application via recv.</p>

<p>Here are two <strong>wrong</strong> ways to fix this:</p>

<ol>
<li>After applying the bpf use recv in a loop to discard packets from the socket until it is empty. This typically works but it breaks down if the traffic rate is greater than the rate at which you can discard packets. (e.g. if you’re sniffing on a very high traffic machine and your app typically loses packets when the socket’s buffer fills but it doesn’t matter for your use-case.) In this case your attempt to empty the socket will turn into an infinite loop.</li>
<li>Add user-mode checks that duplicate the BPF’s logic and check all packets after receiving them. Duplicate logic leads to bugs. Enough said.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Now lets look at the textbook solution for fixing this bug - the same solution that <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/f4fcc9396dc425399846cf082f9ed1056b81dd11/pcap-linux.c#L6096">libpcap uses</a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct sock_filter zero_bytecode = BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, 0);
struct sock_fprog zero_program = { 1, &amp;zero_bytecode};

if (setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;zero_program, sizeof(zero_program)) &lt; 0) {
	printf("error attaching zero bpf: %d\n", errno);
	return 1;
}

char drain[1];
while (1) {
	int bytes = recv(sock, drain, sizeof(drain), MSG_DONTWAIT);
	if (bytes == -1) {
		// we assume the error here means there is nothing left to read from the socket which is exactly what we want
		break;
	}
}

// bpf_program is the actual bpf program we want to apply - just like in the previous example
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));
char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will now always match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>What we’re doing here is taking advantage of the fact that swapping one BPF out for another is an atomic operation: if you swap one BPF for another then at every moment either the first is in place or the second but never neither. We therefore start by applying the so-called “zero-BPF” which is a BPF that matches no packets. Then we empty out any packets that arrived before the “zero-BPF” filter was applied. At this point the socket is definitely empty and it can’t fill up with junk because the zero-BPF is in place. Then we replace the zero-BPF with the real BPF we want. Because the swap is atomic we know that any packet in the socket after that must match the real BPF.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

    <p>High performing teams thrive on accountability. Accountability is the foundation for a culture that gets stuff done: if you say you’ll do something, we all trust that it will happen. Accountability is empowering, creates great opportunities for learning, and allows the company to move faster. You can’t succeed in a competitive environment without it.</p>

<p>The more complex your organization, the more elusive accountability becomes. Startups foster learning because they’re high-accountability arenas: it’s immediately obvious when Bob isn’t towing the line. As a company scales, accountability easily gets lost if ownership isn’t well-defined and outcomes aren’t immediately observable. When things go well, people claim any victory that occurred in their area code as their own. When they go poorly, people skitter away to dusty corners of the org chart or just make excuses. This leads to a vicious cycle of eroding trust, heavyweight management processes, and disempowerment.</p>

<p>Eventually, when enough balls get dropped, leadership makes big, all-or-nothing decisions that either abandon accountability altogether or are overly harsh. The senior people in the vicinity of a big win get promoted. People find scapegoats. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid this inevitable landmine? Get high-quality accountability from transparency.</p>

<h2 id="why-transparency-works">Why Transparency Works</h2>

<p>The first reason that transparency leads to accountability: <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/05/we-work-harder-when-we-know-someones-watching">people rise to the occasion when they know they have an audience</a>, and transparency gives your team a front row seat to the action. Put another way, people (generally) don’t want to publicly screw up. The light peer pressure of transparency immediately delivers results.</p>

<p>On healthy teams, people want to see their teammates succeed and will lend a hand if they see something falling off-track. But most people don’t want to go to their teammates with some form of “hey, it looks like you’re screwing up.” Transparency lowers the friction involved in asking or offering help.</p>

<p>Transparency also gives you observability well before the train flies off the tracks. Imagine the conversations below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Hey Bob, at the last 2 standups you said you were planning to get to Project X next. Still on-track for launch on the first of the month? Let me know if there are blockers I can help with, or if we should discuss whether it even still makes sense as a priority.”</li>
  <li>“Hey Bob, why did X not get done? We had planned for it to be done by the first of the month. What happened?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these conversations will get you to accountability, but the former conversation is infinitely easier. It’s early, and there is time to get help or adjust plans. There’s also still room for nuance – does it still make sense to spend our time here at all? By contrast, the latter conversation is an adversarial nightmare and almost guaranteed to elicit a defensive reaction. Transparency allows you to aim small, and therefore miss small.</p>

<p>Finally, if a project truly does fail, transparency helps you address it correctly and fairly.</p>

<p>There’s usually a pretty reasonable explanation when things go wrong. Were our goals unrealistic? Did other priorities get in the way? Did some exogenous factor throw a wrench into our plans? Or, are we in the (relatively uncommon) situation where someone was simply lazy or incompetent? As a manager, you owe it to your team to have a nuanced response to what is almost certainly a nuanced situation.</p>

<p>Transparency gives you a clear trail to understand and take action – which is the bedrock upon which true accountability rests. Trying to get accountability without transparency is like doing brain surgery with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-achieve-transparency">How to Achieve Transparency</h2>

<p>You can achieve transparency through a variety of methods, all centered around tracking true indicators of productivity or progress towards goals.</p>

<p>Tools for transparency should be neutral, objective, and predictable – think of metrics dashboards or a weekly team check-in, rather than a manager nosing in and asking for a status report on a whim. The best forms of transparency are impersonal as they’re rooted in facts and data, not opinions and explanations. They should be at least semi-public: shared between a manager and report, with a team, or with the entire company. And most importantly, transparency efforts must be lightweight: the benefit of more transparency is increased accountability and observability without a decrease in velocity.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite lightweight ways to get more transparency are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make business metrics that you care about public to the company, and automatically publish them to an email list / public chat channel at a regular cadence. For example, create a public Slack channel in which you post metrics such as renewal rate, number of news signups, or number of support tickets per active user once a month.</li>
  <li>Use standups (of any form – live or virtual) to keep projects on track. The key is to follow up on hurdles that have blocked progress for some time as soon as things are off track – standup should be an active listening exercise.</li>
  <li>It’s easy for the “last 10%” of projects to take as much time to complete as the first 90%. As you’re approaching the end of a project, teams should track their current best guess for when a project will go live.</li>
  <li>On a quarterly basis, send everyone in the organization an anonymous poll rating their current job satisfaction on a few key dimensions, and have the CEO / other executives follow up with the heads of large functional groups that report to them.</li>
  <li>For any complex and sensitive business-critical process (e.g. deploying risky code or launching new products to customers), set up a checkin meeting to talk about all upcoming launches. The existence of the public checkin is a strong forcing function for people to run a tight ship.</li>
  <li>If you use an Agile system with sprints, track metrics such as points completed per sprint, average time that stories have been in-progress, or percentage of sprints in which all work is completed.</li>
</ul>

I thought there must be a catch, something complicated that I was missing. But no, it just worked.</p><p id="b626">An additional bonus is that you get the chrome dev tools to help debug any issues or adjust the layout. Also, I love the use of JS promises to implement the async calls between Go and JS, given I have been writing about promises <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/jquery-promises-and-deferreds-i-promise-this-will-be-short-d10275f82717">since 2014</a>.</p><p id="f0ee">The big downside to Lorca is that because it uses Chrome, some application details (like the system menu, icon, title) cannot be customized. The tradeoff is then between application polish and a simple application. Depending on what you are trying to build this might be a deal-breaker, e.g. it would be fine if you are building an internal tool, but for an enterprise application this might not look great.</p><h2 id="872d">Webview</h2><p id="2a63"><a href="https://github.com/webview/webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webview</a> is a library that helps building a web app directly on top of a native components. The code to do this looks like:</p><pre><span id="ab1e">func main() {<br> w := webview.New(true)<br> defer w.Destroy()</span><span id="cc4a"> w.SetSize(600, 200, webview.HintNone)</span><span id="c720"> // Create a GoLang function callable from JS<br> w.Bind("hello", func() string { return "World!" })<p>  // Create UI with data URI <br> w.Navigate(`data:text/html,<br>  &lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>  &lt;html&gt;<br>   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br>   &lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;<br>   &lt;script&gt; hello().then((x) =&gt; { console.log(x) }) &lt;/script&gt;<br>  &lt;/html&gt;`)</p><p>   w.Run()<br>}</p></span></pre><p id="9d61">This is very similar API to Lorca, which I assumed was based on webview. Though unlike Lorca, the output is a bit different:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1598/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png" width="799" height="488" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*X542oA37DqJa9ZW2Bw8KIQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0129">You can see the in the above screen shot the webview application window has no drop shadow, has no border, and it is initialized in the bottom left corner of the screen. This can be customized through the <code>Window</code> method that returns an <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> to the OS dependent window object (<code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSWindow</a></code> in macOS). <strong>This is where the difficulty begins.</strong></p><p id="e6e1">To work with the <code>Window</code> object we must write binding from Go to the native component. For example, if we wanted our window to start centered, we would call <code>center</code> on the <code>NSWindow</code>. So we need to write a binding in three files (adapted from <a href="https://github.com/alediaferia/gogoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gogoa</a>):</p><p id="394b"><code><strong>ns_window.go</strong></code></p><pre><span id="d817">package main<br>// #cgo CFLAGS: -x objective-c<br>// #cgo LDFLAGS: -framework Cocoa<br>//#include "ns_window.h"<br>import "C"<br>import "unsafe"<br>type NSWindow struct {<br> ptr unsafe.Pointer<br>}<br>func (self *NSWindow) Center() {<br> C.Center(self.ptr)<br>}</span></pre><p id="d8b2"><code><strong>ns_window.h</strong></code></p><pre><span id="39df">#include &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;<br>void Center(void *);</span></pre><p id="7e6b"><code><strong>ns_window.m</strong></code></p><pre><span id="a7b8">#include "ns_window.h"<br>void Center(void *self) {<br>  NSWindow *window = self;<br>  [window center];<br>}</span></pre><p id="0968">Then in the <code>main()</code> function we can center the window with:</p><pre><span id="84b9">window := NSWindow{w.Window()}<br>window.Center()</span></pre><p id="5ba1">Unlike Lorca, webview can be fully customized for our application. The problem is that it requires a bit of work.</p><p id="ebec">There are a few other parts of webview that make working with it a bit difficult:</p><ol><li id="2bac">If using Bazel and gazelle, <code>webview</code>'s generated <code>Build.bazel</code> file is incorrect and <code>clinkopts = [“-framework WebKit”]</code> must be patched.</li><li id="0eb2">Calling <code>w.Init</code> only works when <code>w.Navigate</code> is called, but then the <code>w.Eval</code> calls stop working.</li><li id="bb2a">To set the title you could write a binding as described above, or you have to use the <code>Dispatch</code> method e.g. <code>w.Dispatch(func() { w.SetTitle("Title") })</code>. This is incorrect in the provided examples.</li></ol><p id="7998">I am not sure how much of this is <code>webview</code> and how much is <code>NSWindow</code>. More investigation and learning on my part should make it clearer why these things are happening.</p><h2 id="26f6">Electron</h2><p id="994d">My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/building-an-electron-app-with-bazel-d124ed550957">previous post</a> was about building a simple Electron app that looks like:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1422/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png" width="711" height="291" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vS_SKcJKTrHzCySM_hpMVA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="e89d">Electron is used in many large products like VSCode. This is probably because bundling everything into a single application makes portability much simpler and applications can be extensively customized. The downside of bundling the app with a browser and Node.js is that it makes the distribution <strong>very large.</strong></p><p id="d4c0">Getting Golang to play with Electron is also a bit difficult. There are frameworks that make this easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-astilectron</a>, but these are complicated and mostly feature incomplete. Another way might be to use Golang compiled to WASM, which I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341">wrote about before</a>, but this is also not a simple solution.</p><p id="dba6">The benefits of Electron are that it is portable, customizable, and battle tested for application distribution. It is just a bit complicated with Golang.</p><h2 id="83a0">Comparison</h2><p id="b25a">I think the main comparison to be made is customizability vs. simplicity. Lorca is by far the simplest with very limited customizability, webview can be fully customized with some difficulty, and Electron is fully customizable but difficult to use with Golang.</p><p id="ab93">Also the size of the bundle is very different between the frameworks; Lorca has a <strong>8.7 MB </strong>binary, webview <strong>3.7Mb</strong>, and Electron a <strong>157Mb</strong> bundle size. <br>The debugging tools also vary: Lorca and Electron use the Chrome dev tools, where webview uses the Safari dev tools.</p><h2 id="b79a">Conclusion:</h2><p id="987c">Both Lorca and webview work well with Golang, have small distribution sizes, and similar APIs. The main difference is between the underlying renderer being native and debug tooling.</p><p id="2e1d">Electron I think is probably too complicated to use with Golang without a lot of difficulty.</p><p id="8e32">A potential workflow is to use Lorca during development and webview for distribution. Lorca provides familiar tooling for debugging and development, where webview provides the customizability for distribution. Lorca would also be a nice backup as a means of cross-compilation to other operating systems that webview does not support.</p><p id="4108"><em>Note: there are still more options like </em><code><a href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>wails</em></a></code><em> or </em><code><a href="https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>gotk</em></a></code><em> that can provide other means to build/distribute apps.</em></p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

  <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates network architecture engineering. It aims to learn a network topology that can achieve best performance on a certain task. By dissecting the methods for NAS into three components: search space, search algorithm and child model evolution strategy, this post reviews many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient automatic neural architecture search.</p>

<p>Although most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn’t mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.</p>

<p>Automatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">Stanley &amp; Miikkulainen, 2002</a>). In recent years, the pioneering work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> has attracted a lot of attention into the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), leading to many interesting ideas for better, faster and more cost-efficient NAS methods.</p>

<p>As I started looking into NAS, I found this nice survey very helpful by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al 2019</a>. They characterize NAS as a system with three major components, which is clean &amp; concise, and also commonly adopted in other NAS papers.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Search space</strong>: The NAS search space defines a set of operations (e.g. convolution, fully-connected, pooling) and how operations can be connected to form valid network architectures. The design of search space usually involves human expertise, as well as unavoidably human biases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search algorithm</strong>: A NAS search algorithm samples a population of network architecture candidates. It receives the child model performance metrics as rewards (e.g. high accuracy, low latency) and optimizes to generate high-performance architecture candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong>: We need to measure, estimate, or predict the performance of a large number of proposed child models in order to obtain feedback for the search algorithm to learn. The process of candidate evaluation could be very expensive and many new methods have been proposed to save time or computation resources.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-high-level.png" alt="High-level categorization of NAS"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Three main components of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) models.  (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al. 2019</a> with customized annotation in red)</em></p>



<h2 id="search-space">Search Space</h2>

<p>The NAS search space defines a set of basic network operations and how operations can be connected to construct valid network architectures.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-layer-wise-operations">Sequential Layer-wise Operations</h3>

<p>The most naive way to design the search space for neural network architectures is to depict network topologies, either CNN or RNN, with a list of <em>sequential layer-wise operations</em>, as seen in the early work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a>. The serialization of network representation requires a decent amount of expert knowledge, since each operation is associated with different layer-specific parameters and such associations need to be hardcoded. For example, after predicting a <code>conv</code> op, the model should output kernel size, stride size, etc; or after predicting an <code>FC</code> op, we need to see the number of units as the next prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NAS-search-space.png" alt="The sequential layer-wise operation search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2. (Top) A sequential representation of CNN. (Bottom) A sequential representation of the tree structure of a recurrent cell. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To make sure the generated architecture is valid, additional rules might be needed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a layer is not connected to any input layer then it is used as the input layer;</li>
  <li>At the final layer, take all layer outputs that have not been connected and concatenate them;</li>
  <li>If one layer has many input layers, then all input layers are concatenated in the depth dimension;</li>
  <li>If input layers to be concatenated have different sizes, we pad the small layers with zeros so that the concatenated layers have the same sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skip connection can be predicted as well, using an <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log%20/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html">attention</a>-style mechanism. At layer \(i\) , an anchor point is added with \(i−1\) content-based sigmoids to indicate which of the previous layers to be connected. Each sigmoid takes as input the hidden states of the current node \(h_i\) and \(i-1\) previous nodes \(h_j, j=1, \dots, i-1\) .</p><p>

\[P(\text{Layer j is an input to layer i}) = \text{sigmoid}(v^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_\text{prev} h_j + \mathbf{W}_\text{curr} h_i))\]

</p><p>The sequential search space has a lot of representation power, but it is very large and consumes a ton of computation resources to exhaustively cover the search space. In the experiments by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578">Zoph &amp; Le 2017</a>, they were running 800 GPUs in parallel for 28 days and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167">Baker et al. 2017</a> restricted the search space to contain at most 2 <code>FC</code> layers.</p>

<h3 id="cell-based-representation">Cell-based Representation</h3>

<p>Inspired by the design of using repeated modules in successful vision model architectures (e.g. Inception, ResNet), the <em>NASNet search space</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>) defines the architecture of a conv net as the same cell getting repeated multiple times and each cell contains several operations predicted by the NAS algorithm. A well-designed cell module enables transferability between datasets. It is also easy to scale down or up the model size by adjusting the number of cell repeats.</p>

<p>Precisely, the NASNet search space learns two types of cells for network construction:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Normal Cell</em>: The input and output feature maps have the same dimension.</li>
  <li><em>Reduction Cell</em>: The output feature map has its width and height reduced by half.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/NASNet-search-space.png" alt="NASNet search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. The NASNet search space constrains the architecture as a repeated stack of cells. The cell architecture is optimized via NAS algorithms. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012">Zoph et al. 2018</a>)</em></p>

<p>The predictions for each cell are grouped into \(B\) blocks (\(B=5\) in the NASNet paper), where each block has 5 prediction steps made by 5 distinct softmax classifiers corresponding to discrete choices of the elements of a block. Note that the NASNet search space does not have residual connections between cells and the model only learns skip connections on their own within blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/cell-prediction-steps.png" alt="5 prediction steps in one block"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4. (a) Each cell consists of \(B\) blocks and each block is predicted by 5 discrete decisions. (b) An concrete example of what operations can be chosen in each decision step.</em></p>

<p><a name="ScheduledDropPath"></a>During the experiments, they discovered that a modified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648"><em>DropPath</em></a>, named <em>ScheduledDropPath</em>, significantly improves the final performance of NASNet experiments. DropPath stochastically drops out paths (i.e. edges with operations attached in NASNet) with a fixed probability. ScheduledDropPath is DropPath with a linearly increasing probability of path dropping during training time.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377">Elsken, et al (2019)</a> point out three major advantages of the NASNet search space:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The search space size is reduced drastically;</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motif</a>-based architecture can be more easily transferred to different datasets.</li>
  <li>It demonstrates a strong proof of a useful design pattern of repeatedly stacking modules in architecture engineering. For example, we can build strong models by stacking residual blocks in CNN or stacking multi-headed attention blocks in Transformer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h3>

<p>To take advantage of already discovered well-designed network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif">motifs</a>, the NAS search space can be constrained as a hierarchical structure, as in <em>Hierarchical NAS</em> (<strong>HNAS</strong>; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)). It starts with a small set of primitives, including individual operations like convolution operation, pooling, identity, etc. Then small sub-graphs (or “motifs”) that consist of primitive operations are recursively used to form higher-level computation graphs.</p>

<p>A computation motif at level \(\ell=1, \dots, L\) can be represented by \((G^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell)})\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)}\) is a set of operations, \(\mathcal{O}^{(\ell)} = \{ o^{(\ell)}_1, o^{(\ell)}_2, \dots \}\)</li>
  <li>\(G^{(\ell)}\) is an adjacency matrix, where the entry \(G_{ij}=k\) indicates that operation \(o^{(\ell)}_k\) is placed between node \(i\) and \(j\). The node indices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological ordering</a> in DAG, where the index \(1\) is the source and the maximal index is the sink node.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/hierarchical-NAS-search-space.png" alt="Hierarchical search space"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5. (Top) Three level-1 primitive operations are composed into a level-2 motif. (Bottom) Three level-2 motifs are plugged into a base network structure and assembled into a level-3 motif. (Image source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al 2017</a>)</em></p>

<p>To build a network according to the hierarchical structure, we start from the lowest level \(\ell=1\) and recursively define the \(m\)-th motif operation at level \(\ell\) as</p><p>

\[o^{(\ell)}_m = \text{assemble}\Big( G_m^{(\ell)}, \mathcal{O}^{(\ell-1)} \Big)\]

</p><p>A hierarchical representation becomes \(\Big( \big\{ \{ G_m^{(\ell)} \}_{m=1}^{M_\ell} \big\}_{\ell=2}^L, \mathcal{O}^{(1)} \Big), \forall \ell=2, \dots, L\), where \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) contains a set of primitive operations.</p>

<p>The \(\text{assemble}()\) process is equivalent to sequentially compute the feature map of node \(i\) by aggregating all the feature maps of its predecessor node \(j\) following the topological ordering:</p><p>

\[x_i = \text{merge} \big[ \{ o^{(\ell)}_{G^{(\ell)}_{ij}}(x_j) \}_{j &lt; i} \big], i = 2, \dots, \vert G^{(\ell)} \vert\]

</p><p>where \(\text{merge}[]\) is implemented as depth-wise concatenation in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Same as NASNet, experiments in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00436">Liu et al (2017)</a> focused on discovering good cell architecture within a predefined “macro” structure with repeated modules. They showed that the power of simple search methods (e.g. random search or evolutionary algorithms) can be substantially enhanced using well-designed search spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02639">Cai et al (2018b)</a> propose a tree-structure search space using path-level network transformation. Each node in a tree structure defines an <em>allocation</em> scheme for splitting inputs for child nodes and a <em>merge</em> scheme for combining results from child nodes. The path-level network transformation allows replacing a single layer with a multi-branch motif if its corresponding merge scheme is add or concat.</p>

    <p><em>In my daily work, I have the good fortune to work with many very talented
people. Some are professional software developers, like myself. Others are for
example researchers, scientist, project leaders, and so on. Is that you? Do you
also write software, but not as your main activity? Do you have some experience
but maybe no formal training? In <a href="https://unfolded.dev/pages/software-development-easy-to-learn-hard-to-master/">this series of blog
posts</a> I will explain
the best practices that I use, so that you may be able to benefit from them. So
that writing software hopefully takes you less effort and gives you more
pleasure.</em></p><h2 id="the-second-thing-for-new-code">The second thing for new code</h2><p>The very first thing I <em>always</em> do when starting something new, is <code>git init</code>.
Potential new hobby project? <code>git init</code>. Sample code for a blog post? <code>git init</code>. Doing programming exercises on something like Exercism.io? <code>git init</code>.
And then I start using git the way I described in the <a href="https://unfolded.dev/posts/2020-07-21-using-git-more-effectively">first
post</a> of this series. There are
virtually no exceptions to this; it hardly costs me anything and it has helped
me plenty of times.</p><p>The second thing that I do, I do just slightly less often, but still very often:
set up <em>continuous integration</em>. Obviously I won't do that for things that I
never push to a remote. And some things that I push to a remote don't need it
either, for example those Exercism coding exercises. But for anything that I
suspect may have a longer life than a few weeks, including <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/actions">for that sample code
for a blog post</a>, I'll set it up.</p><h2 id="what-is-continuous-integration">What is continuous integration</h2><p>To get rid of potential confusion, let me explain what I mean with continuous
integration, or <em>CI</em> for short. In its most basic form, it's actually quite
simple: every single time you push something to your git remote (e.g. GitHub,
BitBucket, GitLab, etc), an automated process will start that builds your code
and runs all your tests. (You do have unit tests, right? Maybe a nice topic for
a future post in this series.) That's all, if you do that you can claim you're
doing continuous integration.</p><p>The other day, I was talking to one of my researcher colleagues about coding
practices. When I asked him whether he was using continuous integration, he
thankfully asked for clarification. For me the term has become so commonplace
that I hadn't realize that of course for him it wasn't. He is working on a
software library that his (internal) customers integrate into their product. So
quite logically he thought that was what I meant: continuously automatically
integrating his releases into the customer's product code. While doing that is
of course fantastic, that's going quite a few steps further than just basic CI.
In fact, I would say that that is the combination of <em>continuous delivery</em> (the
<em>CD</em> in <em>CI/CD</em>) on his part, plus <em>continuous integration</em> of his delivery on
his customer's end.</p><p>So if you have a <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/">Travis job</a>, a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started">CircleCI
pipeline</a>, a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/">GitLab
pipeline</a>, a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions">GitHub Actions
workflow</a>, a <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/getting-started-with-bamboo-289277283.html">Bamboo build</a>, anything that automatically
build and tests your code when you push it to your remote, you're doing
continuous integration.</p><p>😌</p><h2 id="the-value-of-continuous-integration">The value of continuous integration</h2><p>Ok, so now that we're hopefully on the same page regarding the term <em>continuous
integration</em>, you may be curious why you should bother. Here's a few reasons
that I have.</p><h3 id="safety-net--quality-baseline">Safety net / quality baseline</h3><p>I'm human. I make mistakes. There, I've said it, now you know. I have learnt
that mistakes that escape the development process and end up at the customer,
are way more expensive than mistakes that are caught earlier. So that's why I
like pair programming, because your pair can catch your mistakes while your
making them. It doesn't get any cheaper than that. That's also why I like unit
tests, because they run many times an hour so they also catch mistakes very
quickly. And that's also why I like continuous integration, because it catches
even more mistakes before they escape the development process. For instance,
when I forget to run my unit tests before pushing my code to the remote: CI will
run and immediately notify me. And my reaction to that notification is: cool,
thanks for catching that!</p><p>🤭</p><h3 id="makes-it-easier-for-others-to-contribute">Makes it easier for others to contribute</h3><p>CI runs for any code that is pushed to the remote, not just by me/my team. So if
it's source code that others can also see and use, having CI will lower the
threshold for them to contribute. Even when you have a new team member it will
help. They don't know the source code as well as you do, so they are a lot more
likely to make mistakes. When I contribute code to somebody else's project, it
feels very comforting to see "all green" as part of the automated tests in the
pull request!</p><p>✅</p><h3 id="executable-documentation-of-build--test--deployment">Executable documentation of build &amp; test (&amp; deployment)</h3><p>Just like unit tests are a form of executable code documentation, CI is a form

challenge. Every single time I have to brace myself and mentally prepare for
doing quite a few tries before getting it right. It's just such a complex black
box! You write a script that will run on a not-quite-known configuration on a
unknown server somewhere, and if it fails you get limited feedback. For example,
if you want to automatically test an iOS app, you'll have to specify which
version of the iOS simulator should be used. But before trying the build, you
may not know which are available and what the simulator device identifiers
are that you can use. So you have to try, look at the output, and try again. And
then something else isn't quite right, and you try again. And again. And once
more. Just have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/search?q=%5Bci%5D&amp;type=Commits">eighteen (18!) commits</a> I did for
sample code for a blog post. And you can't even really clean up those commits
because you <em>have</em> to push them to the remote. I guess if it's important to you,
you can do them on a separate branch and squash-merge the branch when you are
done, but I often don't bother. But bottom line: if it doesn't work immediately
and takes a lot of attempts, it's not you. You're not losing your touch, it's
not because you're getting older. You're fine, it's just complicated.</p><p>🤗</p><p>And when you finally have that working CI build and it passes, go ahead and slap that badge on your readme!</p><p><img src="https://unfolded.dev/img/ci-passing.png" alt="CI passing" width="90"></p><p>Since this is a privacy-friendly static web site, I'm not including the ability

<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>))</span>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>

<span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>basicConfig</span><span>(</span><span>level</span><span>=</span><span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>INFO</span><span>)</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods
    defined in the interface."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>


<span># Using the class
</span><span>cfake</span> <span>=</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-48-035c519cee55&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
        10 cfake = FakeCalc()
        11 print(cfake.add(1,2))
---&gt; 12 print(cfake.sub(2,3))


&lt;ipython-input-45-255c6a2093b0&gt; in sub(self, a, b)
        6
        7     def sub(self, a, b):
----&gt; 8         raise NotImplementedError
        9
        10     def mul(self, a, b):


NotImplementedError:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Formal interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
      …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
