      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_3.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 3"></p>
<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>

<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>
<p>Content Launchpad</p>

<li><a href="#different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates plans?</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/attribution">multi-touch, multi-contact attribution</a></td>
<td>so marketing and sales can visualize what’s working to generate pipeline, and most importantly, deals</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/campaign-measurement">campaign measurement views</a></td>
<td>so that companies can easily compare ARR generated to ongoing spend across sales and marketing programs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/sales-activity">sales activity analytics</a></td>
<td>so companies can orient their outbound sales playbook around what works</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/sales-productivity">pipeline analytics</a></td>
<td>because snapshot replay allows sales leaders to explain changes more easily and run tighter sales calls</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/campaign-measurement">intuitive comment features</a></td>
<td>so teams can collaborate and communicate insights quickly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>inbound response measurement (so new, there isn’t a link yet)</td>
<td>so you can measure how long it takes your sales team (or a bot) to respond to inbound leads</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products">integrations</a></td>
<td>with Salesforce.com, Pardot, Marketo, Hubspot, and Google Ads to get sales &amp; marketing data in one place</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/p-convert-ml-recipe-process.png" alt="QFlow.ai Lead Scoring ML Recipe "></p>
<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops
engineer, marketing or sales professional, or have a skill set that offers a unique contribution to our journey, we’re
interested talking with you about a fulfilling job.</p>
<p><strong>It’s been humbling to see our earliest customers use QFlow.ai transform the way that they approach generating and retaining B2B revenue
in a cost-effective way.</strong> During our limited private beta, QFlow.ai generated insights for customers that saved hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ineffective spend, increased forecastable pipeline for sales team by 2.4x, and measurably
worked to get marketing, sales, and finance teams on the same page.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? More building, more listening. An occasional blog post to try to let you know what we’re up to.
And a couple dedicated features for Customer Success teams to complement our ML recipe that predicts and helps mitigate churn.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to join us on this journey, let us know by <a href="https://qflow.ai/contact-us">scheduling a time for a demo</a>.
Until then, we’ll be hard at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<p id="6cad">Let’s take a closer look at the technical aspects of this technology (Global Positioning Systems), starting with the satellites and working our way down to the receivers on the ground.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="586" height="350" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>NavStar GPS satellite</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="2fbd">Background Info</h2>



<p id="2901">The&nbsp;<strong>Global Positioning System (GPS)</strong>, originally known as&nbsp;<strong>NavStar</strong>, was created by the US military back in 1995. NavStar was originally a collection of over two dozen GPS satellites in geosynchronous orbit.</p>



<p id="b621">Nowadays, NavStar has grown to a network of over 30 satellites orbiting the Earth approximately 13,000 miles above the surface. These satellites make two passes over the same spot every day as they move in their west to east orbit.</p>



<p id="a1d9">While other countries are developing their own GPS satellite networks, the US NavStar system is still the standard.</p>



<p id="ab50">Only 24 satellites are needed to provide line of sight coverage to 95% of Earth’s surface. The remaining function primarily as backup and are queried only when more accuracy is needed.</p>



<h2 id="b2ef">Satellites</h2>



<p id="491c">The most critical component on board these satellites is the&nbsp;<strong>atomic clock</strong>. As you’ll soon see, reliable timekeeping is the single most important function of these satellites.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*dZQbtHhY_4vNde3GlVOYLg.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*dZQbtHhY_4vNde3GlVOYLg.jpeg?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>This atomic clock was built for the first GPS satellites in the late 1970s.</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>“Atomic clocks are designed to measure the precise length of a second, the base unit of modern timekeeping. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the time it takes a caesium-133 atom in a precisely defined state to oscillate exactly: 9 billion, 192 million, 631 thousand, 770 times.”</p><p>— Live Science</p></blockquote>



<p id="fb6e"><strong>GPS Payload</strong></p>



<p id="2528">GPS is inherently a passive system. The GPS satellites do not receive any information.</p>



<p id="ed4f">Instead, each satellite reports at regular intervals:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Pseudo Random Code</strong>&nbsp;— an identification value for the satellite (used by the receiver to decode the signal)</li><li><strong>Almanac Data&nbsp;</strong>— the position of the satellite at any given moment in time and orbital information about all other active satellites (this informs the receiver about which satellites should be available and at what time -helping the receiver to more quickly acquire a GPS fix)</li><li><strong>Ephemeris Data</strong>&nbsp;— more specific information about the satellite: it’s current date, time, health, and location. This data is broadcasted approximately every 30 seconds by NavStar satellites. Ephemeris data is usually updated every 2 hours and is valid for 4 hours.</li></ol>



<h2 id="51d9">From A Cold Start</h2>



<p id="66be">Despite the frequency of the broadcast, the almanac alone is generally not accurate enough for a GPS receiver to get a location fix — especially if the GPS receiver is launching from a cold start.</p>



<p id="aec2">More often that not, the cached almanac information of the GPS receiver will be out of date, so some receivers — especially older ones — may have to wait upwards of 10 minutes to receive a full almanac and ephemeris data broadcast from each satellite before they can provide a GPS fix.</p>



<p id="064f">Additionally, ephemeris data has a natural expiry as it can’t be cached for too long due to clock drift. Waiting for the broadcast and reception of updated ephemeris data is the main cause for the long start time of GPS receivers.</p>



<h4 id="3be9"><strong>A-GPS</strong></h4>



<p id="1491">Luckily most modern devices, like today’s smartphones, are able to minimize this wait time. Most modern mobile devices use a variant of traditional GPS technology called A-GPS ( Assisted Global Positioning System) that helps them acquire a GPS fix quickly.</p>



<p id="07cf">A-GPS works by leveraging the phone’s data connection to contact an assistance server. The server will provide the almanac and ephemeris data directly, so the phone no longer needs to wait for the transmission from the satellite. However, once you are out of cell coverage, the phone would then revert back to the onboard GPS unit and will need several minutes to acquire the ephemeris and almanac data in the traditional manner.</p>



<h4 id="a00a"><strong>GPS Signal</strong></h4>



<p id="aa56">Most GPS transmissions are in the UHF portion of the frequency spectrum. Most civilian GPS communication is done on&nbsp;<strong>1575.42&nbsp;<em>MHz</em>&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;<em>1227.60 MHz</em></strong>.</p>



<p id="1531">Additionally, GPS signal uses CDMA spread-spectrum techniques in order to allow all satellites to transmit on the same frequency without interfering with one another.</p>



<h4 id="aae1"><strong>GPS Transmission</strong></h4>



<p id="52c8">According to RadioElectronics, standard GPS transmission is roughly 15000 bits in length and is transmitted at a rate of 50 bits / second — taking about 30 seconds to complete the transmission.</p>



<p id="9c18">The frame is split up into 5 sub-frames each 300 bits in length with a transmission time of 6 seconds.</p>



<p id="b0d2">The frames help the receiver identify the start and end of the transmission so they can easily synchronize with the incoming signals and decode the transmission.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Sub-Frame 1:&nbsp;</strong>Clock, GPS Time, Health of Satellite, Satellite ID</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 2–3:</strong>&nbsp;Ephemeris Data</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 4–5:</strong>&nbsp;Almanac Data</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="c16d">Receiver</h2>



<h4 id="950a">Trilateration</h4>



<p id="9d46">GPS, on the receiver side, works by using an approach called&nbsp;<strong>trilateration</strong>.</p>



<p id="2646">Imagine I told you I was 150 miles from Los Angeles, 200 miles from Las Vegas, and 75 miles from your Fresno.</p>



<p id="83f1">With just those 3 distance values, you would be able to determine a region that matches these constraints and would be able to estimate my current location within that region. The more distance measurements you have, the more accurate your estimate of my location becomes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="578" height="558" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Trilateration Example</figcaption></figure></div>



<p id="c6d2">GPS requires at minimum distances to 3 satellite in order to get a fix on your location. As we already known, GPS signals include the location of the satellite and the time according to the satellite’s internal clock. If we measure the time that we receive the message and compare the difference in time to the time the message was sent from the satellite, we can figure out how long the message was in transit. Additionally, knowing that all of these signals are sent at the speed of light, we can multiply these two values together to compute your straight line distance to a particular satellite.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="582" height="422" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="b6c2">Satellites use expensive atomic clocks for this very reason. The more accurate the time value transmitted, the more accurate the receiver can be about it’s distance to the satellite.</p>



<p id="7cc7">Though we can figure out a user’s 2D location using just 3 satellites, using a 4th satellite allows us to compute an altitude value. While a 2D location fix might work for some cases as GPS would assume you’re near sea level, if you were on a mountain, a 2D fix could have an error of several hundred meters.</p>



<p id="5d42">Furthermore, because receivers — like a mobile phone — often have cheaper less accurate clocks — we need to account for the timing error introduced by the cheaper hardware and other environmental factors (decreases in the signal’s speed caused by the ionosphere and the troposphere). Using a 4th satellite will not only provide an altitude value, but it will allow us to solve a system of equations that let’s us identify the clock error and compute a more accurate position.</p>



<p id="30e2">Most modern GPS receivers will use this additional information to try and synchronize their internal clock with the satellite’s atomic clock.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="579" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="44af">That’s why most modern GPS receivers will typically track all available line of sight satellites, but only use some subset for the actual calculation.</p>



<p id="4221">Now that the GPS receiver’s antenna can pick up at least 4 satellites, it can accurately calculate it’s position and time in 3 dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve wondered how sites like Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram are able to tell you whether a username has been taken so quickly. It seemed like these services were able to search through hundreds of millions of user records to verify the uniqueness of a prospective username in no time at all.</p>



<p>After some research, I came across the data structure that is responsible for this speed – a probabilistic data structure called the bloom filter.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Bloom filters share some similarities with traditional sets. Generally speaking, a set will tell you with certainty whether it contains a particular element or not. Bloom filters, however, make a slightly different promise. </p>



<p>They are probabilistic data structures which means they’ll tell you with certainty whether an element is <em><strong>not</strong></em> in the set and they’ll tell you if it is <em><strong>probably</strong></em> in the set. In other words, there’s a chance that bloom filters will return a false positive. That is, they’ll incorrectly claim that the set contains an element that was never added.</p>



<p>Maybe you’re wondering why a data structure that can only probably tell you if it contains an element is useful? Well, bloom filters are extremely fast and memory-efficient as we’ll soon see. Sometimes the speed and scalability of a solution are more important than the occasional false positives. In practice, if you know what your acceptable false positive rate is, you can calculate an initial size for the bloom filter to guarantee that rate.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are simply a bit array of <em><code>m</code> </em>bits all initially set to 0. We’ll also need <em><code>k</code></em> different hash functions. These functions will be run over whatever item we are trying to add to the set and will return the indices in the bloom filter to turn from a 0 to a 1.</p>



<p>It’s important that whatever hash functions we choose create a uniform random distribution for best results. There are many industry standard options to pick from: HashMix, murmur, and the fnv series – just to name a few. </p>



<p>Generally, the number of hash functions needed would be a small constant derived from whatever false positive rate is acceptable for your use case. </p>



<h2>Initialization</h2>



<p>Let’s take an empty bloom filter and add an element to it.</p>



<p><code>let size = 10</code></p>



<p><code>let bloomFilter = Array(repeating: false, count: size)&nbsp;</code></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Adding an element</h2>



<p>To add an element, we’ll take the element we want to add and pass it to all <code><em>k</em></code> hash functions to get <code><em>k</em></code> array indices. We’ll set the value at those indices to 1.</p>



<blockquote><p>In practice, these would not be 3 distinct hashing algorithms. Instead, it’d likely be the same algorithm just seeded with a different value (i.e. <em>1 … k</em>) which will generate <em>k</em> distinct hash functions.</p></blockquote>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>







<p>Now, it might look something like this:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And after adding a few more entries to the set:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Querying</h2>



<p>If we wanted to query for an element, we’d do the same operations to get the k array indices. Then, if any of the bits at those indices are 0, we know definitively that the value is not in the set. Instead, if all of the indices values are 1, we know that the value is probably<em> </em>in the set – remember it could still be a false positive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter.search(“digital”)</code> which in turn calls:</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] // 2</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] // 6</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] // 7</code></p>



<p>So, to check if the element is in the set, we just need to check indices 2,6, and 7 and verify they are set to 1.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><span><strong>1</strong></span></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So, now we know that “digital” is probably in the set.</p>



<h2>Limitations</h2>



<p>It’s important to understand that elements can only be added to bloom filters and never removed. We can’t reset particular bits back to 0 because we don’t know if there’s some other element in the set that also maps to those indices. For example, after passing through the hash functions, “dog” and “cat” might share the exact same indices. </p>



<p>Remember the filter isn’t storing the data anywhere unlike traditional sets, arrays, etc, it’s just turning on certain indices.&nbsp;So, there’s no way of checking what word a particular set of indices relates to. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Implementing bloom filters requires us to specify the size upfront, so we can’t enlarge the data structure later. As a result, the more elements we add to the filter, the higher the error rate rises. So, it’s important to choose an initial size for the bloom filter that can scale with your data and allows you to keep a maintainable error rate.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>add(): O(k)<code>&nbsp;</code></p><p>contains(): O(k)</p><p>where k is the number of hash functions. </p></blockquote>



<p>One of the key advantages of bloom filters is that the time to add or check for inclusion in the set is constant; it’s completely independent of the number of items in the set.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are used everywhere. Chances are in just getting to this site you’ve encountered one. Chrome uses a local Bloom filter to store malicious URLs. Before navigating to a site, the browser will check if the site exists in the set of malicious URLs and if it does it’ll perform a full check on Google’s servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="fa89">This week’s edition — edge detection in images. More specifically we’ll be taking a closer look at the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="3f05">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="77be">Grayscale Images</h2>



<p id="7b79">The Sobel algorithm works by measuring the varying pixel intensity in an image. Naturally, this is easiest to accomplish when the image is a standardized grayscale image.</p>



<p id="f1c5">There are several algorithms to generate grayscale images — the simplest being an average of the R,G, and B values in a pixel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="53f5">Then, we re-assign these new intensity values to the R,G, and B fields of the original pixel. Any situation where all the R,G, and B values are the same will give you a shade of gray (remember&nbsp;<em>#00000</em>&nbsp;is black and #<em>FFFFFF</em>&nbsp;is white).</p>



<p id="105e">However, though this often gives good results, the following grayscale function uses a weighted average that is better aligned with how the human eye interprets different colors and the transition between them.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="bd35">Regardless of which formula we use, we now have a grayscale image that we can apply the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm too.</p>



<h2 id="ae13">Sobel Detection Algorithm</h2>



<p id="d390">The Sobel algorithm was developed by Irwin Sobel and Gary Feldman at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in 1968.</p>



<p id="b93f">In the simplest terms, their algorithm works by running a 3×3 matrix&nbsp;<em>(</em>known as the&nbsp;<em>kernel)&nbsp;</em>over all the pixels in the image. At every iteration, we measure the change in the gradient of the pixels that fall within this 3×3 kernel. The greater the change in pixel intensity, the more significant the edge there is.</p>



<h2 id="b7e3">Convolution</h2>



<p id="43f6">The algorithm relies heavily on a mathematical operation called convolution.</p>



<p id="a297">Convolution is simply the process of multiplying and adding corresponding indices of two matrices together (the kernel and the image matrix) after flipping both the rows and the columns of the kernel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>The kernel on the left has its rows and columns flipped and then multiplied by the corresponding indices in the image matrix.</p>



<p id="7d73">The standard implementation of the algorithm uses the following 3×3 matrices for the&nbsp;<em>x&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;axis, respectively.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/974/1*8IyZO5lbk8Nk37opXhl0sQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/974/1*8IyZO5lbk8Nk37opXhl0sQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Pre-Convoluted Kernel (A is a matrix containing the image data)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/455/1*VfpLiujnVqszZneW6zxQdA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/455/1*VfpLiujnVqszZneW6zxQdA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Convoluted version of the kernel above</p>



<p id="a71c">Now, we have completed all of the pre-processing and have the convoluted matrices in hand.</p>



<p id="d5af">We can iterate through all pixels in the original image and apply the image convolution kernels Gx and Gy at every step of the way. This convolution operation will return a single integer for each kernel.</p>



<p id="ea00">Here’s an example of what applying the Gx kernel on a specific pixel (in red) would look like:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>On the left is the original image with the 3×3 pixel group colored</p>



<p id="0fa7">The penultimate step is to create a new image of the same dimensions as the original image and store for the pixel data, the magnitude of the two gradient values:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="66aa">A recommended next step would be to normalize all of the data in the new image by dividing all the pixel values by the greatest gradient magnitude observed.</p>



<p id="414d">Now, you have a new grayscale image whose pixel intensities reflects how close they are to an edge in the original image. Naturally, the higher the gradient value for the pixel, the brighter the edge in the resultant image will appear.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/300/1*jX_A7jlhirg46m7whnJsKw.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/300/1*jX_A7jlhirg46m7whnJsKw.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Sobel Edge Detection Result</figcaption></figure></div>

Unemployment rose to levels not seen since the Great Depression.</p><p>Shortly afterwards states around the country passed emergency laws to protect the most vulnerable people. In 32 states, governors and public utility commissions (PUCs) passed <strong>utility shut-off moratoriums</strong> to ensure that no households lost their electricity because they couldn’t pay their bill.</p><p>Six months later many of those moratoriums have expired or are set to expire in the next month. Between May and mid-August, 10 states allowed their moratoriums to expire. In the next month another 14 state moratoriums will expire. That means <strong>by October 1st a total of 36 states won’t have moratoriums in place.</strong></p><p>In order to understand the impact of these policy changes, Carbon Switch analyzed data provided by public utility commissions in these states, unemployment data, and energy spending data. Our goal was to understand how many people could be at risk of losing their electricity this year.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="2104617" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="847ece8" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="8833eed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Key highlights</h3><ul><li><strong>In the next month 34.5 million households will lose their utility shutoff protections as moratoriums in 14 states expire.</strong> About 4 million of those households are currently below the federal poverty line. 4 million people in those states are unemployed.</li><li><strong>76 million American households won’t have utility shutoff moratoriums after October 1st.</strong> By that point moratoriums will be voluntary in 36 states. About 10 million of the households in those states are currently below the federal poverty line.

When the statewide moratorium expires on September 1st they will all be at risk of losing their power.</li><li><strong>8 of the country’s 10 biggest utilities will shut off customers’ power by Sept 15.</strong> These utilities serve 53 million Americans. The only two utilities that won’t resume shut offs by September 15th are PG&amp;E and SCE, California-based utilities that legally can’t resume shutoffs until at least next year due to the state’s moratorium.</li><li><strong>Black families are twice as likely to have their power shut off as white families.</strong> According to the 2009 United States Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey African American households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level were shut off twice as frequently as white households (11.3% compared to 5.5%).</li><li><strong>Utility shutoffs cost lives, people’s health, and their dignity.</strong> Every year brings stories of people killed after their power is shut off (often due to fires and heat stroke).

As they wrote: “Between April 1 and June 30, 1,369,786 residential customer accounts have become eligible for disconnection but have not been disconnected.”</p><p>For context, there are 3,815,392 households in North Carolina meaning that more than a third of households are behind on payments.</p><p>Unfortunately little has changed in North Carolina since that July 15 report and the moratorium is set to expire on September 1st. According to the most recent BLS data, there are 419,812 unemployed people in the state (compared to 199,494 a year ago).</p><p>Wisconsin is another state that released data on how many customers are behind on their utility bills. According to <a href="https://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/5-ui-120_data_update_august_2020.pdf">a recent government report</a> about 33% of utility customers were behind on payments as of July (compared to 12% a year ago).</p><p>When surveyed for that report, 36 of the 41 utilities that responded said they planned to resume shutoffs.

Few of them specified when they would resume shutoffs. Many of them have quietly resumed shutting off the power on their customers in the months since. While others plan to resume shutoffs in mid-September. One of the country’s biggest utilities, Southern Company — a Georgia-based utility with 9 million customers — never had an internal shutoff moratorium in the first place.</p><p>Carbon Switch gathered data on the number of customers at the 10 largest utilities and their shut off policies. We found that the top 10 utilities control 62% of the investor-owned utility market and serve 63 million customers. (It’s important to note that a customer is a household, not an individual. Considering the average household in America has 2.5 people, their policies likely affect about 157.5 million Americans).</p><p>Here’s a summary of these utilities shutoff policies during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>1 utility (Southern Company) never stopped shutting off their customers’ power.</li><li>3 utilities (Exelon, Xcel, and Florida Power and Light) quietly resumed shutoffs in May and July.</li><li>4 utilities (Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, First Energy, and AEP) plan to resume shut offs in September.</li><li>2 utilities (PG&amp;E and SCE) are barred by California’s moratorium from shutting off their customers’ power until at least next year.</li></ul><p>It’s worth emphasizing that the only utilities that have extended their moratoriums past September 15th are the two utilities based in California, a state with the nation’s longest spanning moratorium. The others plan to resume shut offs despite recent reports that as many as a third of customers are behind on payments in some states.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b958695" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="1240" height="974" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png 1240w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-300x236.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-1024x804.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-768x603.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bbfb297" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="fb983df" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e7cba1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Shutoffs and injustice</h3><p>In 2018 a 72-year-old woman living in Sun City West, Arizona died during a heat wave in which temperatures reached 100 degrees.

		<p>by David L. Duffy.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found some chess analogies, metaphors and thought experiments from philosophers a little unimpressive, speaking as someone who was once a middling club player. Some philosophers have been what I think of as serious players – at least one has been an International Master — but I don’t see their thoughts as widely cited as, for example, Dennett in the case of “Chmess”, or even Sellars’ “Texas Chess”. Serious chess players know there is a technical literature of many thousands of books, and databases containing ~15 million games played since people started recording them. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> They know playing chess is intensely pleasurable and addictive, that winning well is a joy, but even losing is not so bad. Abuhamdeh and Csikzentmihalyi found that maximum pleasure in their study was felt when one’s opponent was 260 Elo points <em>stronger</em> (that is, one’s chance of winning was only 20%). <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Csikzentmihalyi calls chess as played by humans <em>autotelic;</em>&nbsp;that is, intrinsically motivating. Chess players know that chess-thought combines a mixture of “intuitive” pattern recognition and brute force mental visualisation of the future chess positions that will follow particular sequences of moves (“calculation”). They know and enjoy a family of variant forms of chess – I used to play a lot of “Transfer” (known as “Bughouse” in the US), which involves players passing captured pieces to their teammates, who may place them on their board, a la Shogi, but all under a time limit, as well as Kriegspiel where you and your opponent are unaware of each others’ moves, but are informed about captures and checks. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Chess has been of great interest to the computer science community as what was seen as a hard problem for “machines do[ing] the things that would require intelligence if done by men” (Minsky 1968). Now <em>AlphaZero </em>has reached the highest levels in just 24 hours of self-play, it is seen as a trivial mechanical task, much easier than walking without falling over, or working out that the truck in front of your car is not the sky. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> When I played through the originally published <em>AlphaZero</em> chess games, I found them hilarious. They actually have a very human feel, as opposed to those played by conventional chess engines which search through the set of all possible moves a certain number of plies into the future of the current position. (Partly this was because neither program was using standard opening books.) <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> &nbsp;<em>AlphaZero</em>’s open source successor <em>lz0</em> (<em>Leela</em>) has a putative Elo rating of ~3400, about the same as <em>Stockfish</em>, while the best human is ~2800 (so the human might beat the program perhaps one game in a hundred). <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> &nbsp;Computer programs don’t enjoy chess, and don’t have an aesthetic response to beautiful combinations of moves. But the pleasures of the chess player are “merely” the subjective experience of successfully meeting a meta-cognitive goal, one that drives all playfulness, and the related goals of the aesthetics of thought. We get a dopamine rush from our comprehension of elegance, simplicity and complexity, and of surprise (some may remember Koestler’s <em>Ha!</em> and <em>Aha!</em>).</p>
<p>The rest of this essay will be a few comments about how various philosophers have interacted with the game of chess and the playing of chess, but before that I will present a little thought experiment of my own. Many comparisons have been made between the acts of playing chess and carrying out mathematical calculations or solving mathematical problems. If one is some kind of Chess Platonist, one has the image of a Universe of approximately 10<sup>40</sup> possible sequences of moves sitting out there. <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Dancing Pixies argument of Putnam, Searle, Bishop, and others is that, with the right interpretation, the interactions between atoms in a rock are computations and thus, for us computationalists, thought. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; They could also be interpreted as all those chess games. So I now have a concretized Platonic Chess Universe sitting in my garden. One merely needs to <em>construct</em> the apparatus to extract the games from the rock, and if one wished to use these to beat your human opponent, construct a further method of filtering out all the winning games arising from the current position. There are a couple of stories in Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Cyberiad</em> that are relevant, but Mrs Beeton’s recipe for Stewed Rabbit may also apply. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>(1) If I were asked to answer, in one sentence, the question “What was Wittgenstein’s biggest contribution?”, I should answer “His asking of the question ‘Can one play chess without the queen?’” (Wisdom 1952) <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Well, people spot weaker players a queen all the time, and don’t think anything of it. After all, you can lose your queen during a game anyway, and the resulting play is a subtype of standard play (usually endgame), rather than a new game. If one is playing the Old Indian Opening, for example, the players can choose to enter a Queen-less game in 5 moves. You might refine Wittgenstein and ask whether introducing a new set of rules specifying starting from a particular position (that is, setup of pieces on the board), or playing under the standard rules to get there is the same. Like, there are 10<sup>40</sup> different games lurking in there that people had never noticed before. In the Old Indian example, the players collaborate to reach a Queen-less board, but they may collaborate in all kinds of ways, such as repeatedly playing a particular chess opening variant they are both interested in (or in a grandmaster draw, as a strategy for winning a chess tournament).</p>
<p>(2) From Dummett’s explication of Frege on chess:</p>
<p><span>Proposition 1</span>: <em>Neither chess moves nor positions on the chessboard express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</em> Proposition 2: <em>The theory of chess consists of meaningful propositions about chess moves and chess positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems. </em><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>These seem plausible, but the way I think of chess soon led me to:</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 1</span>: Neither bead moves nor positions on the abacus express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 2</span>: The theory of abacus use consists of meaningful propositions about bead moves and positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>I think it obvious that AP1 and AP2 are incorrect. My preferred interpretation for the abacus: Bead movements and positions concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate those of other concrete objects.</p>
<p>My preferred interpretation for chess: Chess moves and positions on the chessboard concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate the concrete objects, actions and decisions of soldiers.</p>
<p>A: chess is a war game.</p>
<p>B: The warfare modeled by the rules of chess is ancient Indian warfare, with peasant infantry, elephants, aristocratic cavalry and chariots.</p>
<p>C: Winning such a battle required the capture or death of the opposition king.</p>
<p>D: Winning usually requires the general to sacrifice many of his own soldiers in order to win, unless the opponent has made an error.</p>
<p>E: A general fights against another general, and usually will plan as if his opponent will make the best response to any given attack, although he will set up traps with the hope they will succumb.</p>
<p>F: Each wields a Theory of Mind that is domain specific, and must incorporate both low-level and high-level properties of the game or the organisation of fighting. For example, chess players and generals both divide up the elements of planning into strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>My preferred conclusion: Although the game is greatly abstracted, there are many high-level analogies to warfare.</p>
<p>As it happens, Deleuze and Guattari make much of these isomorphisms in <em>A Thousand Plateaus&nbsp;</em>, as in the State of chess versus the Nomads of Go/Wei Chi – “chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary’s pieces: their functioning is structural, while Go pieces… have extrinsic relations with nebulae or constellations”, and so on. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>My mental model of chess as simulation is therefore similar to a scientific model. There is the reality, the model that abstracts certain features of reality, and the theory that applies to the model. In a game, the pleasures arise in implementing and running the model, but are related to some of those of the reality (this is far more obvious in modern computer games). <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>

<p>At the moment, the Epic Games page in the App Store is not available – journalist John Voorhees was one of the first to notice this. The store gives an error whenever you try to go to the page of the company itself or one of its applications using a direct link, but you cannot find it in the search.</p>




<p>Users also noted that downloading apps from Epic, including Fortnite, will not work, even if they are already assigned to a user account.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg 289w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px"></figure>



<p>Apple released an official statement on this matter – the company noted that they were “very sorry” to take such measures, but Epic left no choice.</p>



<blockquote><p>The court recommended that Epic follow the App Store’s guidelines and policies while the case is in progress – the rules they followed over the past ten years until they created the current situation themselves. Epic refused.</p><p><br> Instead, the company has repeatedly submitted Fortnite updates that violate store rules. This is unfair to all other developers in the App Store and makes users suffer from conflict.</p><p><br> We hope to be able to cooperate again in the future, but at the moment this is unfortunately not possible.</p><p><br> from Apple statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The corporation has warned that it is going to delete Epic Games accounts back on August 17th. Apparently, another account of the company, Epic International, is still available in the App Store – it was previously banned from blocking in court. Therefore, the situation should not touch upon the support of the Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>On the day Epic’s profiles were deleted, the App Store began to actively promote Fortnite’s direct competitor, PUBG Mobile. The online shooter appeared on the main page of the “Games” section, and the promo was published on the store’s official twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The tweet was also noticed by the head of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>

<p>While you wait for Fortnite to return to iOS and Mac, here’s another great Battle Royale powered by the Unreal Engine!</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688">archive.org</a>

   <p>I recently refereed Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares's <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">"Functional Decision
Theory"</a> for a philosophy journal. My recommendation was to accept
resubmission with major revisions, but since the article had already
undergone a previous round of revisions and still had serious
problems, the editors (understandably) decided to reject it. I normally don't publish
my referee reports, but this time I'll make an exception because the
authors are well-known figures from outside academia, and I want to
explain why their account has a hard time gaining traction in academic
philosophy. I also want to explain why I think their account is wrong,
which is a separate point.</p>

<p>I actually don't know Nate Soares, but Eliezer Yudkowsky is a
celebrity in the "rationalist" community. Many of his posts on the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Less Wrong blog</a> are
gems. I also enjoyed his latest book, <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/"><i>Inadequate Equilibria</i></a>.
Yudkowsky seems to be interested in almost everything, but he regards
decision theory as his main area of research. I also work in decision
theory, but I've always struggled with Yudkowsky's writings on this
topic.</p>

<p>Before I explain what I found wrong with the paper, let me review the
main idea and motivation behind the theory it defends.</p>

<p>Standard lore in decision theory is that there are situations in
which it would be better to be irrational. Three examples.</p>

<blockquote> <b>Blackmail.</b> Donald has committed an indiscretion.
Stormy has found out and considers blackmailing Donald. If Donald
refuses and blows Stormy's gaff, she is revealed as a blackmailer and
his indiscretion becomes public; both suffer. It is better for Donald
to pay hush money to Stormy. Knowing this, it is in Stormy's interest
to blackmail Donald. If Donald were irrational, he would blow Stormy's
gaff even though that would hurt him more than paying the hush money;
knowing this, Stormy would not blackmail Donald. So Donald would be
better off if here were (known to be) irrational.</blockquote>

<blockquote> <b>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin.</b> Twinky and her
clone have been arrested. If they both confess, each gets a 5 years
prison sentence. If both remain silent, they can't be convicted and
only get a 1 year sentence for obstructing justice. If one confesses
and the other remains silent, the one who confesses is set free and
the other gets a 10 year sentence. Neither cares about what happens to
the other. Here, confessing is the dominant act and the unique Nash
equilibrium. So if Twinky and her clone are rational, they'll each
spend 5 years in prison. If they were irrational and remained silent,
they would get away with 1 year.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes.</b> A demon
invites people to an experiment. Participants are placed in front of
two transparent boxes. The box on the left contains a thousand
dollars. The box on the right contains either a million or nothing.
The participants can choose between taking both boxes (two-boxing) and
taking just the box on the right (one-boxing). If the demon has
predicted that a participant one-boxes, she put a million dollars into
the box on the right. If she has predicted that a participant
two-boxes, she put nothing into the box. The demon is very good at
predicting, and the participants know this. Each participant is only
interested in getting as much money as possible. Here, the rational
choice is to take both boxes, because you are then guaranteed to get
$1000 more than if you one-box. But almost all of those who
irrationally take just one box end up with a million dollars, while
most of those who rationally take both boxes leave with
$1000.</blockquote>

<p>The driving intuition behind Yudkowsky and Soares's paper is that
decision theorists have been wrong about these (and other) cases: in
each case, the supposedly irrational choice is actually rational.
Whether a pattern of behaviour is rational, they argue, should be
measured by how good it is for the agent. In <i>Newcomb's Problem with
Transparent Boxes</i>, one-boxers fare better than two-boxers. So we
should regard one-boxing as rational. Similarly for the other
examples. Standard decision theories therefore get these cases wrong.
We need a new theory.</p>

<p>Functional Decision Theory (FDT) is meant to be that theory. FDT
recommends blowing the gaff in <i>Blackmail</i>, remaining silent in
<i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>, and one-boxing in <i>Newcomb's
Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>.</p>

<p>Here's how FDT works, and how it differs from the most popular form
of decision theory, Causal Decision Theory (CDT). Suppose an agent
faces a choice between two options A and B. According CDT, the agent
should evaluate these options in terms of their possible consequences
(broadly understood). That is, the agent should consider what might
happen if she were to choose A or B, and weigh the possible outcomes
by their probability. In FDT, the agent should not consider what would
happen if she were to choose A or B. Instead, she ought to consider
what would happen if <i>the right choice according to FDT were A or
B</i>.</p>

<p>Take <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Without loss
of generality, suppose you see $1000 in the left box and a million in
the right box. If you were to take both boxes, you would get a million
and a thousand. If you were to take just the right box, you would get
a million. So Causal Decision Theory says you should take box boxes.
But let's suppose you follow FDT, and you are certain that you do. You
should then consider what would be the case if FDT recommended
one-boxing or two-boxing. These hypotheses are not hypotheses just
about your present choice. If FDT recommended two-boxing, then any FDT
agent throughout history would two-box. And, crucially, the demon
would (probably) have foreseen that you would two-box, so she would
have put nothing into the box on the right. As a result, if FDT
recommended two-boxing, you would probably end up with $1000. To be
sure, you know that there's a million in the box on the right. You can
see it. But according to FDT, this is irrelevant. What matters is what
<i>would</i> be in the box relative to different assumptions about
what FDT recommends.</p>

<p>To spell out the details, one would now need to specify how to
compute the probability of various outcomes under the subjunctive
supposition that FDT recommended a certain action. Yudkowsky and
Soares are explicit that the supposition is to be understood as
counterpossible: we need to suppose that a certain mathematical
function, which in fact outputs A for input X, instead were to output
B. They do not explain how to compute the probability of outcomes
under such a counterpossible supposition. So we don't get any details
spelled out. This is flagged as the main open question for FDT.</p>

<p>It is not obvious to me why Yudkowsky and Soares choose to model
the relevant supposition as a mathematical falsehood. For example, why
not let the supposition be: <i>I am the kind of agent who chooses A in
the present decision problem</i>? That is an ordinary contingent
(centred) propositions, since there are possible agents who do choose
option A in the relevant problem. These agents may not
follow FDT, but I don't see why that would matter. For some reason, Yudkowsky and
Soares assume that an FDT agent is certain that she follows FDT, and
this knowledge is held fixed under all counterfactual suppositions. I
guess there is a reason for this assumption, but they don't tell
us.</p>

<p>Anyway. That's the theory. What's not to like about it?</p>

<p>For a start, I'd say the theory gives insane recommendations in
cases like <i>Blackmail</i>, <i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>,
and <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Take
<i>Blackmail</i>. Suppose you have committed an indiscretion that
would ruin you if it should become public. You can escape the ruin by
paying $1 once to a blackmailer. Of course you should pay! FDT says
you should not pay because, if you were the kind of person who doesn't
pay, you likely wouldn't have been blackmailed. How is that even
relevant? You <i>are</i> being blackmailed. Not being blackmailed
isn't on the table. It's not something you can choose.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that's not much of an objection. I say you'd be insane
not to pay the $1, Yudkowsky and Soares say you'd be irrational to
pay. Neither of us can prove that their judgement is right from
neutral premises.</p>

<p>What about the fact that FDT agents do better than (say) CDT
agents? I admit that if this were a fact, it would be somewhat
interesting. But it's not clear if it is true.</p>

<p>First, it depends on how success is measured. If you face the
choice between submitting to blackmail and refusing to submit (in the
kind of case we've discussed), you fare dramatically better if you
follow CDT than if you follow FDT. If you are in <i>Newcomb's Problem
with Transparent Boxes</i> and see a million in the right-hand box,
you again fare better if you follow CDT. Likewise if you see nothing
in the right-hand box.</p>

<p>So there's an obvious sense in which CDT agents fare better than
FDT agents in the cases we've considered. But there's also a sense in
which FDT agents fare better. Here we don't just compare the utilities
scored in particular decision problems, but also the fact that FDT
agents might face other kinds of decision problems than CDT agents.
For example, FDT agents who are known as FDT agents have a lower
chance of getting blackmailed and thus of facing a choice between
submitting and not submitting. I agree that it makes sense to take
these effects into account, at least as long as they are consequences
of the agent's own decision-making dispositions. In effect, we would
then ask what decision rule should be chosen by an engineer who wants
to build an agent scoring the most utility across its lifetime. Even
then, however, there is no guarantee that FDT would come out better.
What if someone is set to punish agents who use FDT, giving them
choices between bad and worse options, while CDTers are given great
options? In such an environment, the engineer would be wise not build
an FDT agent.</p>

<p>Moreover, FDT does not in fact consider only consequences of the
agent's own …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5.

We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020. The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you may not express your true opinion over the phone about which presidential candidate you support. Sometimes people click on a button by accident, so we just wanted to verify your response. Are you …</p></div></div>

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> has been JavaScript’s unofficial standard functional programming library for a decade (together with its major fork, <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>). Its most recent significant development is the move to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">ECMAScript 6 modules</a> (ESM). Underscore 1.11 is the first version to be fully modular.</p>
<p>With the new modularity, you can now create a custom build of Underscore with an even smaller footprint. At the same time, we still provide the standard UMD build, which is perfect if you want to get started quickly. The UMD bundle is easy to work with and it has great cache retention if you load it from a CDN.</p>
<p>Underscore was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> and he is still helping with the releases. Besides Underscore, he created several other awesome JavaScript libraries and tools, notably <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>.

<h3 id="what-is-_">What is _?</h3>
<p>Besides a bunch of essential functions, Underscore exports an object named <code>_</code>, which is central to its functionality. Hence the name “Underscore”. <code>_</code> is all of the following at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A namespace handle through which you can access the <code>VERSION</code> string as well as all the functions: <code>_.each</code>, <code>_.VERSION</code>.</li>
<li>The entry point for customizing the behavior of Underscore functions, currently through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#iteratee"><code>_.iteratee</code></a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#template"><code>_.templateSettings</code></a>.</li>
<li>The default placeholder for <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#partial"><code>_.partial</code></a>.</li>
<li>A special value wrapping function that enables <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#oop">OO style</a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#chaining">chaining</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of namespace handle is probably the most well known. Before the advent of ES6 modules, having such a namespace handle was a necessity. There are many other libraries from this era that exploit the namespace handle to be a useful function as well. jQuery’s <code>$</code> is a famous example of this. While there is no longer a strong incentive to have a multi-purpose namespace handle, it continues to be useful, so we keep it around in Underscore. In ES6 module context, it is still the <code>default</code> export.</p>
<p>Arguably, the role of special value wrapping function is much more interesting. Thanks to this function, you can do <code>_.map(x, f)</code>, <code>_(x).map(f)</code> or <code>_.chain(x).map(f).value()</code>. These expressions are equivalent, and they share a single underlying implementation of the <code>map</code> function. The same applies to all other Underscore functions. This is made possible by having a standalone definition of each function, and then adding all functions to <code>_</code> with a single call to <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#mixin"><code>_.mixin</code></a>. It is a very elegant design; please take a peek at (the bottom of) the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">annotated source</a> if you’d like to admire the details.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-monolithic-interface">What is the monolithic interface?</h3>
<p>The <code>_</code> object with its magical bells and whistles is made out of all the parts of the Underscore library. As such, <code>_</code> represents the whole library at once; this is what I mean by the monolithic interface. Historically, this used to be the <em>only</em> interface to the library.</p>
<p>Any module that provides <code>_</code> depends on all of Underscore. If your project imports something from such a module, even if you do not import <code>_</code> itself, then your project effectively imports all of Underscore. I refer to this as “using the monolithic interface” in a wide sense.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though! With modular Underscore, you can have all the tricks that <code>_</code> provides, such as chaining, and still be selective about which parts you want to import. Basically, you can create your own variant of the monolithic interface. I’ll cover the details below.</p>
<p>I should add that Underscore is both lightweight and widely adopted. Using the standard monolithic interface is a wise choice in many cases. More on this below as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-modular-interface">What is the modular interface?</h3>
<p>As of version 1.11, every individual part of Underscore can be imported from a separate module. Selectively importing these parts directly, instead of relying on a module that gives you the monolithic interface, amounts to using the modular interface.</p>
<p>There is a separate module for each Underscore function. Some of these functions, notably <code>mixin</code> and <code>chain</code>, can be used to create your own customized monolithic interface.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the modular interface brings powerful flexibility but also responsibility. The standard monolithic interface is well designed and coherent. If you choose to omit parts of it, you might end up with something that doesn’t do what you want.</p>
<p>I will detail the options and the pitfalls below.</p>
<h3 id="why-tiny-modules">Why tiny modules?</h3>
<p>In general, spreading the source code of a project over multiple modules promotes code reuse. If I can pick the code that I am interested in from your library, without having to import code that I am not interested in, then I am more likely to use the code that you already wrote, instead of reinventing the wheel. Everyone saves time and we get our flying cars sooner.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2849">modularized Underscore</a>, I went for the most extreme option: I put every function in a separate module. I did this in order to maximize the potential for code reuse. I want users to be able to select <em>exactly</em> the code that they need; no more, no less. I am already working on a library that will exploit this myself.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-treeshaking">What about treeshaking?</h3>
<p>In theory, I would not need to go all the way down to individual function modules in order to get perfect selectivity. Tools like <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a> can isolate individual functions from a larger module, a “trick” known as treeshaking. In practice, however, static analysis of JavaScript is hard. With everything being mutable and unsafely typed, it can be hard to tell whether one piece of code might influence another, especially without human intelligence, and the tools are far from perfect as a result.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2826">early stage</a> of my modularization effort, all of the exported functions were still pooled together in a single ES module. At this stage, I tested treeshaking with <code>_.map</code>. It sort of worked, in the sense that the result was only about half as large as the whole Underscore library. When I further split this module down to the individual functions, however, <code>_.map</code> shrank by another factor of 3. It turns out that <code>_.map</code>, and the other Underscore functions that it depends on, together make up only one sixth of the library.</p>
<p>\( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \), so there is a whole third of the Underscore code that Rollup is not able to treeshake. The only way to avoid needlessly importing that code is to manually isolate it in a separate module, which is exactly what I did.</p>
<h3 id="what-build-variants-can-i-choose-from">What build variants can I choose from?</h3>
<p>The source code consists of ESM modules. These modules live in the <code>modules/</code> package subdirectory and you can use them directly. From the source, we build several variants in order to cater to a wide range of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>underscore.js</code> (in the package root), the monolithic UMD bundle. This file has the same path and the same format as older versions of Underscore. It is also still the <code>main</code> entry of the package, and it is the variant that you are most likely to use in the short term.</li>
<li><code>underscore-esm.js</code>, the monolithic ESM bundle. While fully supported, this variant is likely to see mostly experimental usage in the short term.</li>
<li><code>amd/</code>, the modular AMD build. This directory contains an AMD version of each source module.</li>
<li><code>cjs/</code>, the modular CommonJS build, analogous to the modular AMD build.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Monolithic bundle” in the first two build variants means both that the variant provides the monolithic interface, and that it is entirely contained in a single file.</p>
<p>Naturally, only the modular variants support modular usage. All variants support monolithic usage, but for efficiency, it is best to use the monolithic bundles.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-monolithic-build-variants">Why have monolithic build variants?</h3>
<p>Modules are useful, but the monolithic bundles have some compelling advantages as well (besides backwards compatibility):</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is easier to read and it is easier to see the big picture. This is why we render the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">single-read annotated source</a> from the monolithic build. Although it can be fun and somewhat illuminating to discover the code by clicking through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/modules/index-all.html">the annotated modules</a>.</li>
<li>Reading a single large file from a file system is substantially faster than reading many small files.</li>
<li>On the web, sending a single request with a large response is substantially more efficient than sending many requests with small responses.</li>
<li>Since Underscore is such a major library, cache retention is likely to be very good if you embed the standard monolithic bundle from a CDN, especially the UMD bundle. More on this in the next sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-cdn">What are the benefits of a CDN?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-a-cdn-to-speed-up-static-content-delivery">CDNs</a> are <em>awesome</em>, especially for open source libraries. In a nutshell, websites often use the same resources—such as Underscore—and by referencing those resources from a common URL, instead of hosting their own copies, they enjoy <em>collaborativ…</em></p></article></div>

	<p><img alt="SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS" src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ancient.png"></p>
<p>Recent events&nbsp;have completely exposed the limits of individual agency, creating a powerful demand for squad-based forms of resiliency. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent of these social bonding agents: though we're <em>physically</em> distancing, <em>emotionally</em> we're getting closer. First priority when the virus dropped was securing your squad. The need for group coordination and decision-making soon followed.</p>
<p>But today's emerging culture of group cohesion is driven equally by the social and financial precarity of urban life. <em>Family are those we share space and rent with</em>. Priced out of tier-1 cities, individuals have banded together to survive a jobless market with no social safety net.</p>
<p>Squads are both a product of—and a response to—contemporary social atomization. The trope of "getting a place upstate" signifies young city-dwellers' desire for new kinds of squad-based homesteading. HOMESQUADING is a modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement">back-to-the-land movement</a>—swap Whole Earth-inspired post-war communes with post-internet surf clubs microblogging the virtues of cooperative housing, permaculture gardening, and solar-powered mesh networks.</p>
<p>Squad culture is the antithesis of neoliberal individualism. Millennials are healing from decades of irony poisoning, rediscovering what it's like to have generative, exploratory relationships with one another. Younger generations are already imbued with extremely powerful squad energy, equipped with formative experiences in Minecraft, DOTA 2, and Fortnite parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ngram.png" alt="Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of &quot;SQUAD&quot; discourse."></p>
<p>Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of "SQUAD" discourse.</p>
<p>Whether bound together for survival or for lols, the squads formed by today's crisis will be resilient. Distance is no longer a barrier with the closeness of network space—soon vital culture will be predominantly enacted by fictive kin. Group collaboration is now the strong default, putting squads at the center of social, cultural, and economic life. To paraphrase Bill Bishop: today people are born as individuals, and have to find their squad.</p>

<p>While ancient squads were brought together by the struggle for survival, always-on group communication sets the scene for contemporary squad culture. Group chats and adapted team workspaces create shared context and institutional memory. One necessary condition of the squad is this sense of <em>persistence</em>: co-presence and continuous availability to one another.</p>
<p>But the squad is more than a loose network of affiliations, it's a coherent body. A second prerequisite of squad formation is self-recognition. It's not you or me. It's <em>Us</em>. <em>We.</em> <em>Ours</em>. This pillar often follows from the first. Squads may start as one-off Telegram channels, but they soon become "The Group Chat," a metonym for the squad itself.</p>
<p>For the squad to understand itself as a whole, it maintains boundaries circumscribing strong group norms. Fuck a Dunbar number—the ideal squad count is no more than 12. How can you really be <em>present</em> with more than a dozen people? Small groups are crucial for tight coordination. A greater network may surround the squad, making it appear big and fuzzy from the outside. But for the core crew, an invisible circle binds and protects a space of group identity.</p>
<p>As SQUAD VIBES grow, so does the possibility of interdependence and resource sharing—social, emotional, financial. Trust brought by consistent socialization and self-recognition is a foundation for exploring what the squad is capable of together. SQUAD CULTURE has only just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY">begun</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-theory.png" alt="Theory of the squad"></p>

<p>The pandemic flipped the script on sharing space IRL, but our newly domestic reality only brought to the physical world what was already extremely online. Originally conceived as series of linked documents, Web 2.0 mass productization turned the internet into a series of linked interiors.</p>
<p>Today's squads are expressions of digital locality and the new squad era forces us to reconsider the individuated logic of early social networks. Contrary to early visions of hypertext, the internet is not a singular World Wide Web, traversed by individuals. To be online today is to enter the global arena. Mass social media are hazardous PvP zones no one should traverse without team support.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network-groupings.png" alt="Network graph of twitter with people-based groupings"></p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network.png" alt="Network graph of twitter"></p>
<p>The Twitter subcultures shown above are only a sliver of an expansive social deep web. Beneath this fuzzy graph is SQUAD SPACE, the network of inner-zones where digital microcultures are born: group DMs, Discords, Slacks, Keybases. Memes forged in SQUAD SPACE bubble out into the "clearnet" above, pwning NPCs on the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">internet of beefs</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-spaces.png" alt="Evolution of squad spaces"></p>
<p>Squad culture is downstream of squad space, and the digital places squads inhabit are only getting more advanced. The Discord can suddenly be on calls together. The Keybase can now use Git. <a href="https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/">The team toolkit defines its capabilities</a>, and different platforms enable different modes of squad thought. Squad space is more than environment, it's a collective body, a shared cognition layer. Squad space is where market-moving trades are planned, conspiracies are conceived, and memes are spawned. Members of the squad may live in different geographies—but within this space, everyone is on SQUAD TIME. <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/">The founding of a new group DM is year zero</a>.</p>
<p>Group dynamics ebb and flow with their environment, and nowhere more than SQUAD SPACE. Ecology calls this process “niche formation.” Online it's SQUAD CULTURE.</p>

<p>Inside the subterranean caves of the social deep web, chosen-kin groups grow their own culture. The squad doesn't need its own micro-currency—images, art, music, takes, shitposts, and, indeed, roasts are the native medium of exchange. Likewise squads have little use for internal financial incentives. Instead, playful exchanges produce trust, reciprocity, and VIBES—the ineffable group energy that squads value most. Accordingly, the core of squad production is the continuous production of the squad itself.</p>
<p>Evidenced by the power of crypto memetics, ragtag squads of shitposters have the power to define new forms of value based on their own esoteric social frameworks. Memeing produces "assets" that cannot be traditionally valued, but are capable of commanding cultural and economic movements.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-vibes.png" alt="Examples of squad vibes, including Twitch plays Pokemon, Chainlink $LINK Marines, Weird Sun Twitter, Brockhampton, Tik Tok Hype Houses, Theory of Vibe by Peli Grietzer, Bitcoin, and Headless Brands"></p>
<p>Memes, hot takes, internal language, 𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼... artifacts that can only be formulated as a group are the mainstay of squad production. The group exudes potent SQUAD VIBES, and vibes attract. Outsiders want to share the vibe—sometimes for the social capital, sometimes because the content produced is of strategic value, and always because the energy is infectious. After enough fire in the group DM, some squads begin to externalize their social products. Podcasting is obviously a squad technology. Rapid publishing turns memes into whitepapers, quickly flooding the marketplace of ideas with locally-grown squad humor.</p>
<p>Whether formed by necessity or chance, once together the squad's potential for creative production is immeasurable. <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview">VIBE</a> is an unstable substance of high informtion density. In formalizing their vibes, squads may accidentally give birth to <a href="https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/">headless brands</a>, virtual personalities, and pseudonymous entities they may not even be able to control. Thus the squad transitions from its youthful, entropic state, harnessing its vibes to create a source of unfathomable squad energy.</p>


<p>Group identity. Shared space. Vibes. These not only enable the creation of social capital, but strengthen the squad's capacity to organize, minimizing transaction costs and leading to greater productive capacities and resilience; this is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm">the nature of the squad</a>." But while squads can be viewed as a "nexus of contracts", unlike the Coasean firm, they are without legal structure. Social contracts are instead effected through the unspoken bonds of <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd">mutual respect and ingroup norms</a>.</p>
<p>But to sustain this solidarity economy the squad may look for ways to translate vibes into monetizable modes of public engagement: clients, subscribers, sponsors, music deals, yields. SQUAD PRODUCTION begins with the creation of processes and interfaces to convert creative labor into units that can be transmitted by global network participants. Here SQUAD TOOLS come into play. Vibes generated at the DAW, on the Figma board, or in the gaming lobby are turned consumable cultural instruments. Then it's just a matter of distribution. Young artists create online galleries and independent labels because they allow groups to interact (and transact) with the world through familiar organizational patterns. Bandcamps, Twitch pages, DAOs are public APIs for squads to interact with entities beyond their trust boundary.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-trust-stream.png" alt="Example of a Twitch stream from Berlin-based Trust (squad)"></p>
<p>Some digital tools are public interfaces, while others are used to coordinate internally. Today this SQUAD INFRASTRUCTURE is comprised of simple software primitives: Venmo, Splitwise, Cash App. These apps are financial plumbing that facilitate internal coordination between squad members by minimizing the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. Despite the strong demand for SQUAD RESILIENCY, the social stigma of group finances is still a major barrier to economic exchange among friends.</p>
<p>In-app mechanics like budget trackers, polls, and coin-flips offer a half-way point between social agreements and technical solutions. For instance Splitwise relies heavily on the social norms to ensure expenses are entered accurately. By allowing individuals to opt-in to a set of rules for retroactive settlement the group's social friction and coordination costs are reduced. Civilization advances by extending the number of important functions squads can perform without thinking.</p>
<p>Some believe new software can liberate "individual creators." But this kind of thinking inevitably leads to Uberized platform-mediated wage labor. We want to liberate squads. <em>The <strong>group</strong> is the basic user class for the tools we need today as a society, yet few pieces of software allow the squad as a whole to produce cooperatively and generate wealth together</em>. To fully realize SQUAD CULTURE this must change.</p>

					<div>
						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

<p>From Germany come leaks around the performance of the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC MILAN</strong>&nbsp;CPUs, which are expected to be the first CPUs with the&nbsp;<strong>Zen3</strong>&nbsp;microarchitecture&nbsp;to hit the market.&nbsp;As indicated, the&nbsp;<strong>7nm</strong>&nbsp;manufacturing process, the same maximum number of cores (64), the use of DDR4 memory, and the PCI-Express 4.0 interface are maintained.</p>
<p>The novelties are changes in the structure of the Core Compute Die (CCD) and, therefore, of the Core Compute Complex (CCX).&nbsp;Each of the current CCDs consists of two CCX clusters in which the L3 cache is divided into two 16MB caches.&nbsp;With MILAN&nbsp;<strong>this cache will not be divided</strong>, so it comes in the form of a single 32 MB cache.&nbsp;AMD itself had mentioned integrating more than 32 MB in October, so it apparently has not reached more than 32 MB.&nbsp;The number of nuclei is identical to eight per CCD, but the CCX clusters in their former form no longer exist.</p>
<p>The data also provides performance values: these speak of&nbsp;<strong>a +15 percent CPI-related performance increase</strong>&nbsp;for entire workloads.&nbsp;For EPYC processors with up to 32 cores, AMD wants to achieve&nbsp;<strong>a performance increase of +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;compared to ROME processors with Zen2 cores;&nbsp;single thread performance should also increase&nbsp;<strong>by +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For the largest EPYC processors with up to 64 cores, AMD expects a performance increase&nbsp;<strong>of around 10 to 15 percent</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Apparently,&nbsp;<strong>AMD can achieve a higher clock frequency</strong>&nbsp;for processors with fewer cores, so that the increase in performance has a correspondingly greater effect with fewer cores.&nbsp;So far this is not surprising, as it is the expected performance improvement since practically the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>If we want a bigger performance leap, we will have to wait for the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC GENOVA</strong>&nbsp;, where&nbsp;<strong>Zen4 @ 5nm</strong>&nbsp;with TDPs from 120&nbsp;<strong>to 240W</strong>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>DDR5</strong>&nbsp;memory&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>PCI-Express 5.0</strong>&nbsp;interface&nbsp;would come into play&nbsp;, which would arrive at the end of 2021.</p>

<p>The other day I watched “See” on Apple TV+. The premise of the show is that after some apocalyptic event, humanity has lost its sense of sight and all humans are born blind. I quite enjoyed watching it but I can’t say I care much whether it gets extended for another season.</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing they do in the show is tie knots in strings and ropes to communicate. People trace the strings with their fingers, reading them like books. The system is never explained in much detail but people in the show are able to send messages that way. I thought this was a very cool idea and started thinking about how to design a system like that.</p>

<p>Initially, I considered a knot-based morse code with either two types of knots or the presence/absence of one type of knot to represent dots and dashes. Since that would mean up to five knots per letter, however, and I wanted to keep the number of knots as low as possible, I decided to come up with my own encodings of the Latin alphabet. To keep things simple, I used a fixed number of knots per letter.</p>

<p>Given these constraints, I had to decide how many different types of knots my system would be based on. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the only numbers that make sense are 2, 3 and 6. Two types of knots require five knots per letter, three types require three knots and six types require two.</p>

<p>My last major contact with the world of knots was as a young boy on vacation with my parents at the North Sea coast, learning about knots used on fishing ships. Since I don’t remember much about those knots, I hit google to see what was on offer. Turns out that (like for everything in this world) there is a community of knotters online.</p>

<p>To be suitable for this projects, the knots had to fulfil the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distinctiveness</strong>: they had to be distinct to the touch so that the “reader” could tell them apart without needing a sense of sight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull resistance</strong>: I’m sure there’s a term of art for this in professional knot tying. The knots should not come undone when pulling on opposite ends of the string.</li>
  <li><strong>Placability</strong>: choosing a location on the string and placing the knot there should be easy. This is probably true for all knots with sufficient practice but it’s easier for some than for others.</li>
  <li><strong>Locality</strong>: it should be possible to tie the knot without having to pull through one end of the string. Turns out there’s a phrase for this, knots of this kind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29%23In_the_bight">tied in the bight</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/test-knots2.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Testing different knots. Turns out twisted twine is not ideal for tying knots.</em></p>

<p>After an evening of playing around with different knots, these are the ones I ended up choosing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhand_knot"><strong>Overhand</strong></a>: this is the most fundamental knot and my go-to to tie anything together.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_loop"><strong>Butterfly</strong></a>: this knot creates a nice distinctive loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 1</strong>: this is what I called a butterfly knot with an additional overhand knot in the loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 2</strong>: same as above but with two overhand knots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.101knots.com/barrel-knot.html"><strong>Barrel</strong></a>: this knot creates barrel along the string.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_figure-eight_loop"><strong>Double figure-eight</strong></a>: a knot that forms two loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Six knots with two knots per character give us 6^2 = 36 possible combinations which is exactly what we need for 26 letters and 10 digits (no spaces or lowercase letters exist in this encoding). One optimisation I made in mapping these combinations to the different letters and digits was to assign each knot a difficulty value (turns out I was pretty off in my guesses of how difficult each knot would be to tie). Each possible combination of two knots then had a combined difficulty equal to the sum of the difficulties of each constituent knot. I assigned the letters in order of frequency such that the most frequent letters would be easiest to tie, the remaining ten combinations I assigned to the ten digits at random. This is the mapping I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/mapping.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Mapping knots to letters &amp; digits.</em></p>

<p>Reading about knots online, I discovered that paracord is the medium of choice for people who pursue this hobby. I got some and it is a much more pleasurable experience to tie with compared to the cheap twine I was using before. Another purchase I made was what seems to be the authoritative source on knots: The Ashley Book of Knots. I have only skimmed the book so far but if I ever make a version two of the speaking knots, I’m certain it will be a repository of possible knots to integrate into any future encoding.</p>

<p>After tying a few one letter strings, I eventually tied this seven meter beast:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/human-rights.jpg" alt="human-rights">
<em>“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”</em></p>

<p>After trying out the system, here are some things I learned about the different knots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overhand</strong>: the fact that this is not tied in the bight makes this much more annoying to tie than I first thought. I would not include this knot again for this reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly</strong>: this knot and its variants are perfectly suited for this project and don’t have any downsides.</li>
  <li><strong>Barrel</strong>: this knot is aesthetically pleasing but not only is it not tied in the bight, it needs three pull-throughs to be completed! There does seem to be a variant of it that doesn’t have this downside but I haven’t played with it yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Double figure-eight</strong>: this knot works but it wastes a lot of string and has a very thick main part that the two loops grow out of. It’s also hard to distinguish from the butterfly by touch alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I might decide to spend more time on this project in the future but for now, I’m happy with how much fun I’ve already had with it. If I do, these are some ideas for possibly improvements and additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different knots/different mapping based on what I learned about the knots I chose.</li>
  <li>Some way of preventing the reader to get out of sync with which pairs on the string form the letters. If either the author or the reader of the message accidentally skip one knot, the message ends up garbled. This isn’t a big issue since when that happens, all that’s required is to shift one knot and try again.</li>
  <li>Single knots for common letters or even words to speed up the tying process. This would also help with synchronisation.</li>
  <li>Some way of indicating the direction a string is meant to be read in. Maybe a bead tied into the string. I considered beads also as part of the encoding but decided against it so that no additional material would be needed to write a message.</li>
  <li>Splicing together pieces of string. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_knot">blood knot</a> should make this possible. Since it looks very similar to the barrel knot that’s part of the current encoding, I would probably have to choose between the two. This could indicate a space. Assembling longer messages from multiple pieces of string would also somewhat solve the problem of having to tie knots that are not died in the bight in long pieces of string.</li>
  <li>The distance between two knots could be integrated into the encoding and assigned some significance.</li>
  <li>Maybe some completely different way of encoding meaning that isn’t based on the Latin alphabet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand">Shorthand</a> could be a possible source of inspiration for a writing system that is designed for speed. Googling for similar ideas, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu">Quipu</a> system used by the Inca people. I couldn’t find much about how specifically it worked and maybe that knowledge isn’t extant but it would be cool to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the beginning of this year, I joined <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> – a fellowship of entrepreneurs at various stages of launching their startups – with the goal of expanding my professional network in the Bay Area and finding a co-founder for my next venture.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck was designed as a 10-week onsite program, with social events such as weekend trips, lunches, etc. However, no one had anticipated a global pandemic to strike, and On Deck had to switch to fully remote operations even before the group had a chance to meet in person.</p><p>‍</p><p>The decision to continue as a remote program came a few weeks before the cohort start date. By then, I have already flown into San Francisco, rented a place, and was testing several startup ideas. As such, the announcement was a huge blow to me, and I was disheartened to learn that the sessions would be conducted online. All the dinners, parties and team bonding activities I was looking forward to have been replaced with Slack chats and Zoom calls.</p><p>‍</p><p>In retrospect, it is incredible how quickly On Deck managed to reorganize the entire curriculum into a fully-remote event. Kudos to their swift response and hard work in making On Deck 2020 possible! If they had cancelled the cohort, I would not have met all the amazing people and my co-founder.</p><p>‍</p><h3>So how did it all play out?</h3><p>The first day started with a 4-hour virtual kickoff session. We were split into groups and played icebreaker games. Through introductions, games, and breakout activities, we got to know everyone in the cohort.</p><p>‍</p><p>Without us knowing at the time, our groups were not random. On Deck evaluated the participants and thoughtfully paired those with complementary skills together. Therefore, it was not entirely coincidental that the first person I spoke to that day became my co-founder (months later). Job well done On Deck!</p><p>‍</p><p>What followed was 10 weeks of diverse activities:</p><ul role="list"><li>Breakout sessions</li><li>Hackathons</li><li>Speed dating</li><li>1:1 meetings</li><li>Virtual dinners</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>The breakout sessions were a dream come true – imagine the cool founders you follow on Twitter all appearing in your calendar: <a href="https://twitter.com/julialipton" target="_blank"><strong>Julia Lipton</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover" target="_blank"><strong>Ryan Hoover</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vhmth" target="_blank"><strong>Vinay Hiremath</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasklinger" target="_blank"><strong>Andreas Klinger</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33" target="_blank"><strong>Elizabeth Yin</strong></a>, and so on. You are free to select topics that are relevant or of interest to you to attend. Each session has around 10 participants, so there are ample opportunities to ask questions and interact with the speaker.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img alt="Snack was built for an ODF hackathon." src="https://assets.website-files.com/5df35853014f242fc4ae89f1/5f47e314a1a0eae8151bf231_snack-call.jpeg"></p><figcaption>(Snack was built for an ODF hackathon)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Meanwhile, hackathons allowed groups to work together and demonstrate their strengths. It was during one of these hackathons that I built <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Snack</strong></a>. On Deck were the first adopters and their feedback shaped the product today. At this point in time, I already had several conversations with my future co-founder on starting a business together. I look up to him &amp; like what he is working on, and him seeing me build a hackathon project that grew to be used by hundreds of Slack organizations is what sealed the deal.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Today</h3><p>My co-founder (<a href="https://twitter.com/_BenHQ" target="_blank"><strong>Ben</strong></a>) and I are building a <a href="https://contra.com/" target="_blank"><strong>professional network</strong></a> for people you actually work with. Meanwhile, <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/team" target="_blank"><strong>Tracy</strong></a> has taken over the day-to-day Snack operations of providing serendipity-as-a-service to teams.</p><p>‍</p><p>Joining <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> is undoubtedly one of the best moves I have pursued. Never have I thought a virtual program could be this engaging and inspiring. In fact, the 10 weeks with On Deck were some of the most sociable weeks in my professional life, and the sense of community continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck did an excellent job creating what felt like serendipity, but is actually a diligently orchestrated event with hand-picked individuals that form a supportive community of shared goals and deep subject expertise. I am excited to share the magic that I felt during O nDeck with you through <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Snack</strong></a>. ❤️</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="4cd9">When you are building Kubernetes applications, itâ€™s easy to end up in with â€œauthentication sprawlâ€� where all of your services have different authentication mechanisms. This tutorial walks through how to centralize your authentication mechanisms using an IdP and an API gateway.</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://blog.getambassador.io/@alex_gervais?source=post_page-----d509ffbc7b6f----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Alex Gervais" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*qrt6AVoODoXwvJUGbeuv0w.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="dcd5"><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak</a> is a widely adopted Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAM for short</a>) open-source solution. 2014 was a big year for groundbreaking technologies as both the Keycloak and Kubernetes projects were initially released a few weeks apart. Unsurprisingly, many Kubernetes end-users are turning to Keycloak as the preferred way to manage access to the secure APIs and services of their platform.</p><p id="3311">Simply running Keycloak in Kubernetes wonâ€™t however make your platform secure. A lot of concerns are left to the user to configure and implement: from exposing the Keycloak API endpoints using TLS and an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-controller</a>, to enforcing security policies on specific business endpoints. When solving these problems, we have a bias towards using an API Gateway solution to handle encrypted connections and centralize API management policies instead of re-implementing authentication strategies in every language and application of your microservice architecture.</p><p id="a6b3">Our goal today will be to install Keycloak as our IAM solution and secure it behind the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>, our API Gateway acting as a Kubernetes ingress controller. As a final step, we will deploy a sample application and demonstrate how to use Keycloak as an Identity provider (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/idp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IdP for short</a>) to restrict access to this application with OAuth2 using request Filters.</p><p id="0895">In this tutorial, we will use a non-production-ready Keycloak installation. To simplify our dependency graph, weâ€™ll use the in-memory datastore, which is totally suitable for a demo but wouldnâ€™t guarantee high-availability in a production environment. If you are looking for production-grade persistence, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_database" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak offers a variety of storage solutions</a>.</p><p id="eedf">The ingress controller is the missing building block in most Kubernetes offerings. Although Kubernetes defines an Ingress resource, it is not actually backed by any implementation that will turn the resource into a public service! The choice and installation of an ingress solution are left to the operator. Here, we will use the community version of the Ambassador Edge Stack, because of its direct integration with Keycloak for authentication, to expose and secure public traffic coming in from internet requests to downstream private services running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="c455">At the end of the tutorial, weâ€™ll be up and running with the Ambassador Edge Stack doing TLS termination at the edge of the Kubernetes network, exposing our Keycloak installation under <code>/auth/</code> and securing our Quote application under <code>/backend/</code>.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1496/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png" width="748" height="520" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4461">Scaffolding with the K8s Initializer</h2><p id="0bfb">Kubernetes is often made fun of because of the copious amounts of YAML required. Instead of going into a scavenger hunt for YAML samples and assembling all puzzle pieces together from stale sources, weâ€™ll be using the <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K8s Initializer</a> to generate all of the Kubernetes resources for us. The K8s Initializer is a project generator tool similar to what exists for application developers: think Spring Initializr or Yeoman.</p><p id="0d5d">The wizard-like interface of the K8s Initializer will guide us through a few questions to understand and configure specific settings that vary from one cloud provider to the other. These implementation details are often where promises are broken and portability falls short, making it hard to configure ingress controllers and expose services to public traffic. Hopefully, we can do away with the little gotchas by using a comprehensive tool like the K8s Initializer who will provide us with an optimal configuration.</p><p id="b086">Specifically for this tutorial, we picked our target Kubernetes cluster: â€œGoogle Kubernetes Engineâ€� with a â€œGoogle External Load Balancer (L4)â€� load balancer. We also chose a public Hostname for our installation. Using a public hostname will require an extra step to configure a DNS entry to point to our installation, but given we want to demonstrate how to build a public secure application stack, itâ€™s worth the extra effort. As for the K8s Initializerâ€™s Auth configuration, we undoubtedly selected Keycloak, with a temporary password.</p><p id="8d03">Once satisfied with our K8s Initializer options, we hit the â€œdownloadâ€� button. Weâ€™ll be given a set of ready-to-go YAML files and instructions.</p><p id="21d8">Give it a try! <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.getambassador.io/</a></p><h2 id="56e8">Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack</h2><p id="fad2">Weâ€™ll start by installing the Ambassador Edge Stack simply because it contains a bunch of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions</a> dependencies. Given you have access to your desired Kubernetes cluster, the installation will be as simple as running <code>kubectl apply</code> commands and configuring a DNS entry to point to the external IP of the provisioned service.</p><h2 id="d5bb">Installing Keycloak</h2><p id="4d13">Installing Keycloak from the generated YAML is again straightforward: a single <code>kubectl apply</code> command. One curious cat might peek at the Keycloak YAML file, donâ€™t worry it wonâ€™t kill you! Youâ€™ll actually be able to appreciate how the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/intro-mappings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Mapping</a> resource will instruct traffic hitting the public <code>/auth/</code> prefix endpoint to be forwarded to our private Keycloak pod running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="f8e2">Giving Keycloak a few minutes to start, weâ€™ll then be able to access itâ€™s UI at <a href="https://domain-name/auth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/auth/</a>. Since we chose to let â€œ<em>Ambassador terminate TLS using a Letâ€™s Encrypt certificateâ€�</em> in the K8s Initializer options, we can appreciate how automatic TLS termination is happening with a secure certificate for our Keycloak installation.</p><p id="e690">We can then log in to Keycloakâ€™s Administration Console UI using the default <code>admin</code> username and the temporary password weâ€™ve selected previously to configure Keycloak to our needsâ€¦ and change the password!</p><h2 id="befa">Configuring a Keycloak Realm, Client and User</h2><p id="a442">To secure our APIs, we will be using our shiny new Keycloak installation as our IdP. We first need to create a client to handle authentication requests from Ambassador Edge Stack. All of these configuration steps can be achieved using the Keycloak UI.</p><ol><li id="06c0">We first start by creating a new â€œRealmâ€�. Hovering on top of the â€œMasterâ€� label in the right-hand navigation, we can click on â€œAdd realmâ€�. We picked <code>ambassador</code> as the â€œNameâ€� of our new realm. This will be needed later on to configure the <code>authorizationURL</code> field in the auth Filter.</li><li id="6e10">Weâ€™ll create a new client by navigating to â€œClientsâ€� and clicking â€œCreateâ€�. We chose the following settings: <br>- <em>Client ID</em>: <code>ambassador</code> â€” This value will be used in the <code>clientID</code> field of the auth Filter.<br>- <em>Client Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Root URL</em>: None, left blank</li><li id="5859">On the following screen, we configured the Client with:<br>- <em>Access Type</em>: <code>confidential</code><br>- <em>Valid Redirect URIs</em>: <code>*</code></li><li id="2392">Navigating to the â€œMappersâ€� tab in our Client, we clicked â€œCreateâ€� and used the following settings:<br>- <em>Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Name</em>: <code>Ambassador Mapper</code><br>- <em>Mapper Type</em>: <code>Audience</code><br>- <em>Included Client Audience</em>: Select the name of the Client from the dropdown. Remember, we named our Client <code>ambassador</code>.</li><li id="cde8">Going back to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we navigated to the â€œClient Scopesâ€� section and configured our Client for <code>offline_access</code>.</li><li id="6c77">Back again to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we then navigated to the â€œCredentialsâ€� section. We took note of the â€œSecretâ€� value as it will be used later when configuring our auth Filter.</li></ol><p id="aeec">Along with our Client configuration, letâ€™s configure a Keycloak â€œUserâ€�:</p><ol><li id="2481">Navigating to the â€œUsersâ€� section of the Keycloak Administration Console, we will click on â€œAdd userâ€�. We gave our user a simple username: <code>my-keycloak-user</code>, then clicked â€œSaveâ€�.</li><li id="c77c">On the following screen, we switched to the Userâ€™s â€œCredentialsâ€� tab to set a temporary password.</li></ol><p id="b25e">Now that we have a user with which we are able to authenticate ourselves with, letâ€™s deploy an application.</p><h2 id="49f6">Deploying a Quote service</h2><p id="902c">Deploying custom applications on Kubernetes is achieved by creating some Kubernetes resources defined asâ€¦ You guessed it, more YAML! This time, since we are deploying a sample backend application, the sample is somewhat lightweight. You can save the following definitions to a â€œquote-service.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f quote-service.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="4f23">---<br>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: Service<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  ports:<br>  - name: http<br>    port: 80<br>    targetPort: 8080<br>  selector:<br>    app: quote<br>---<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  replicas: 1<br>  selector:<br>    matchLabels:<br>      app: quote<br>  strategy:<br>    type: RollingUpdate<br>  template:<br>    metadata:<br>      labels:<br>        app: quote<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>      - name: backend<br>        image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.4.1<br>        ports:<br>        - name: http<br>          containerPort: 8080<br>---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Mapping<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote-backend<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  prefix: /backend/<br>  service: quote</span></pre><p id="c66d">This will create a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code>, <code>Service</code>, and <code>Mapping</code> to publicly expose our running Quote application under the <code>/backend/</code> path.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Alongside the slew of new features added in iOS 13 was a small
(but delightful!) one: when cropping an image in the screenshot preview window, the crop boundaries
would now subtly snap to certain elements in the image:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/settings-crop-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>There was some speculation around how this feature worked — common guesses on a few sites
included edge detection, machine learning, or just… something simpler.</p><p>Turns out, it's that last one! Shoutout to
<a href="https://twitter.com/rydermackay/">Ryder Mackay</a>
for owning the only real
<a href="https://twitter.com/rydermackay/status/1219341583251918849">google result</a>
for <code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code>&nbsp;— the class that handles this logic, and the focus
of this post.</p><p>We'll look at how the metadata harvester works, how to feed extra data to it, and how to completely
break this form of screenshot cropping.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Like so many things on this site, this is much more of a curiosity than
something you should actually do in a production app, especially given how awkward
the implementation is. If you did want to leverage Apple
internals — why waste it on something like this?
<a href="https://bryce.co/recreating-imessage-confetti/">Add some confetti</a> or something instead.</p></blockquote><p><code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> (pronounced “ssssscreenshot-metadata-harvester”, as far as I'm concerned),
is the primary class responsible for collecting screenshot information from your app.</p><p>When a screenshot is taken,
<code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> will work with your app to generate a full-page PDF-based screenshot
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservicedelegate">if you provide one</a>, but otherwise,
it will simply collect two pieces of metadata: the current <code>NSUserActivity</code>'s title, and the bounds of
any “important views” that are present on the screen.</p><p>You can easily see this bounds-collection system in action using <code>lldb</code>. First, set a breakpoint
on <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span><span>[</span><span>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</span> <span>_contentRectsForMetadata</span><span>]</span>

<span>WARNING</span><span>:</span>  <span>Unable</span> <span>to</span> <span>resolve</span> <span>breakpoint</span> <span>to</span> <span>any</span> <span>actual</span> <span>locations</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that the breakpoint wasn't able to resolve to an actual address —
that's because <code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code> is loaded dynamically, and (in my case)
I haven't taken a screenshot yet. But <code>lldb</code> will resolve the correct location
as soon as the framework is loaded later anyways.</p><p>Next, we'll take a screenshot, and execution will pause.
We can then step out of <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code> and inspect the
return value in register <code>x0</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Breakpoint triggered in `_contentRectsForMetadata`:

<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And there we have it! That array contains the rects that our screenshots will snap to
when cropping.</p><p>The views we're collecting bounds from belong to two categories:</p><ol><li>The root view of any view controllers that are currently added to the hierarchy</li><li>If visible, the frame of the on-screen keyboard (sometimes)</li></ol><p>The second category here is somewhat interesting — the keyboard's frame is based on
a call to <code>+[UIPeripheralHost visiblePeripheralFrame]</code>, which doesn't account for
the iPad's floating or split keyboard modes.</p><p>We're not here to talk about keyboards though, so let's look at the more interesting
side of the metadata: view controllers’ view bounds.</p><h4 id="view-controller-traversal">View Controller Traversal</h4><p>The algorithm for finding each view frame traverses the view
controller hierarchy by looking at each view controller's child
view controllers and presented view controller (if any).</p><p>For each of these, the bounds of the view controller's root view
is taken, minus any safe area insets; the bounds are then converted
to the window's coordinate space and appended to a list.</p><p>The resulting algorithm looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>/*</span><span>*</span><span>

</code></pre></div><p>So in a nutshell, view controllers are really what drives the snap areas here.</p><h4 id="-not--abusing-ios-screenshot-cropping-mechanism"><em>Not</em> Abusing iOS’ Screenshot Cropping Mechanism</h4><p>To start with, given that view controllers determine snap areas, it's worth
pointing out that strategic use of child view controllers can actually get you
nicer snap areas somewhat naturally.</p><p>You can even take this to some extremes, like making collection view cell contents
backed by their own view controllers, as discussed in
<a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a>‘s
<a href="https://khanlou.com/2015/04/view-controllers-in-cells/">original article</a>, or
<a href="https://twitter.com/wibosco">William Boles</a>’
<a href="https://williamboles.me/hosting-viewcontrollers-in-cells/">excellent follow-up</a>.
In fact, William's demo project acts as a great example of this behavior:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/collectionview-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>I wouldn't advocate for structuring your app any differently just
for the minor benefit of nicer cropping for screenshots — especially
something as involved as view controllers within cells.</p><p>But, if you find yourself in a scenario where you're deciding whether or
not to use child view controllers in a given situation — keep in mind that
this is one interesting advantage, however small!</p><h4 id="defining-arbitrary-snap-areas">Defining Arbitrary Snap Areas</h4><p>There are two options for modifying the screenshot snap areas,
both of which are a bit terrible.</p><p>The first option is to simply add empty child view controllers
defining the areas you're interested in. By manipulating
the view controller's root view bounds and safe area insets, you can add
arbitrary snap areas. You don't even need to add the view to the parent's
view hierarchy —&nbsp;only a call to <code>-[UIViewController addChildViewController:]</code> is
needed.</p><p>However, this is… questionable at best. In my case, I'd much rather
just swizzle. The setup is made a bit more complex due to us not being able
to use a category (since the class isn't available at link or launch time),
and due to it being a class method.</p><p>There are a few ways around this, like forcing a dependency on
<code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code>, but this all-in-code setup is the cleanest I've come up with:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Holds the original implementation of

is not too interesting. Instead, let's look at how we can use this ability
to modify the screenshot cropping system even more.</p><h4 id="building-stronger-snaps">Building Stronger Snaps</h4><p>There's a fun consequence of the snapping implementation in that, if multiple snap areas
are in close proximity, they'll essentially merge together.</p><p>More concretely, once the cropping tool has snapped to one rect, it will
continue snapping to rects further along in the returned values array.</p><p>This means order matters; if we return snapping rects
with <code>origin.x</code> values of…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
</code></pre></div><p>… then cropping to anywhere near the 10-14 range will result in a snap to <code>14</code>.
But if we reverse the rect order…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 14, 13, 12, 11, 10
</code></pre></div><p>… then we will snap to <code>10</code> instead!</p><p>We can also add rects approaching from both directions to hone in on an area from either side.
This gives us the ability to inflate the snap distance from the default
(of only a few points) to any arbitrarily large margin:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// In `swizzled_contentRectsForMetadata`...

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Firefox 80 and my confusion over its hardware accelerated video on Linux</h2>

	<p><small>August 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The news of the time interval is that Firefox 80 is out and in
theory it can support hardware video acceleration on X11, not just
Wayland (<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/08/firefox-80-release-linux-gpu-acceleration">source</a>,
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Firefox-80-Released">also</a>).
The master Mozilla tracking bug for hardware accelerated video on
X11 is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>, with all
sorts of information. So I downloaded the official release (one of
my Firefox setups uses the official builds these days for reasons
beyond the scope of this entry) and tried to get it to do accelerated
video playback. The short version is that I think I've failed, but I'm
not sure why.</p>

<p>Even in Firefox 80, getting VA-API accelerated video playback
requires a whole series of magic incantations in <code>about:config</code>
preferences and perhaps environment variables when you start Firefox
(this may change in the next release). Assuming that all of those
are set right, Firefox can apparently still decide that it doesn't
like your Linux video driver (or its version), your specific hardware,
or perhaps either or both of the resolution of the source video and
the resolution of your display. Some or many of these can be forced
with Firefox settings, but at the same time the bug reports I've
read say that sometimes Firefox ignores hardware acceleration because
it's slower for the specific circumstances, or because it has known
bugs. If Firefox is making a sensible decision for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/HomeMachine2018">my specific
hardware</a>, that's one thing and I want
it to do what will work best. But if I've missed a setting or if
Firefox is just being twitchy about something, I also want to
override it. In general I know my hardware is capable of hardware
accelerated playback of videos at far lower CPU usage than Firefox
manages (on the same videos).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Firefox won't tell me what it's doing or why, at
least not in a way that I can understand. I've peered into the
depths of <code>about:support</code>, which tells me some of the 'what' but
not the 'why', and I've tried some of the things from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>
without success. If Firefox is or isn't going to do hardware
accelerated video playback, I wish it would tell me both what it was
doing and why. Otherwise I'm probably going to go on being confused
and annoyed with it.</p>

<p>(I care about hardware acceleration not just because of CPU load
but because my perception is that hardware acceleration is necessary
to play back a full sized video smoothly without dropping frames
every so often. This may be wrong on modern hardware, even on my 4k
display.)</p>

				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What is Pointer?</p>
				<p> Pointer is a reading club for developers. It's a window into what other current and future CTOs are reading and thinking about. Super high quality engineering-related content, not just trendy topics or link bait.</p>
			</div>	
			
			<div>
				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of content belongs in Pointer?</p>
				<p> Anything worth reading. It can be language-specific or framework-agnostic, or not even strictly technical as long as it's relevant to a developer. Folks have shared interesting open source projects, a blog post on engineering cultural anti-patterns, and even an academic CS paper from 1982 about why counting starts with 0.</p>

<p><strong>By Chris Hedges</strong> / Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The persecution of the attorney Steven Donziger is a grim illustration of what happens when we confront the real centers of power, masked and unacknowledged by the divisive cant from the Trump White House or the sentimental drivel of the Democratic Party. Those, like Donziger, who name and fight the corporate control of our society on behalf of the vulnerable see the judiciary, the press and the institutions of government unite to crucify them.</p>



<p>“It’s been a long battle, 27 years,” Donziger said when I reached him by phone in his apartment in Manhattan.</p>



<p>Donziger, who has been fighting polluting American oil companies for nearly three decades on behalf of indigenous communities and peasant farmers in Ecuador, has been under house arrest in Manhattan for a year.&nbsp;He will go to trial in federal court in New York on September 9 on contempt of court charges, which could see him jailed for six months.&nbsp;Ever&nbsp;since he won a multibillion-dollar judgment in 2011 against the oil giant Chevron, the multinational has come after him personally through litigation that threatens to destroy him economically, professionally and personally.</p>



<p>“Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger,” Chevron wrote in an internal memo in 2009, as reviewed<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/when-feds-demur-judge-charges-ecuador-crusader-himself/" target="_blank"> by Courthouse News</a>.</p>

<hr>



<p>“It started when Texaco went into Ecuador in the Amazon in the 1960s and cut a sweetheart deal with the military government then ruling Ecuador,” Donziger told me. “Over the next 25 years, Texaco was the exclusive operator of a very large area of the Amazon that had several oil fields within this area, 1500 square miles. They drilled hundreds of wells. They created thousands of open-air, unlined toxic waste pits where they dumped the heavy metals and toxins that came up from the ground when they drilled. They ran pipes from the pits into rivers and streams that local people relied on for their drinking water, their fishing and their sustenance. They poisoned this pristine ecosystem, in which lived five indigenous peoples, as well as a lot of other nonindigenous rural communities. There was a mass industrial poisoning.”</p>



<p>“By the time I went down there in the early 1990s, many people had died, cancer rates were skyrocketing according to several independent health evaluations, people were really hurting. There was zero regard for the lives of the local people by Texaco. I was a very young lawyer back in 1993 when I first went to Ecuador. It was like looking at an apocalyptic scene. There was oil on the roads. People were living in abject poverty. They had no shoes. They would get oil on their feet when they walked along the roads. The oil pollution had permeated every aspect of daily life. It was in the food supply. It was in the water supply. It was in the air. The average person there would get exposed multiple times a day to very harmful, cancer-causing toxins, with foreseeable results.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I, with other lawyers, filed a lawsuit in New York against Texaco. The reason we filed in New York was because Texaco’s headquarters were in New York in 1993. The decisions to pollute in Ecuador, to play God to the people of Ecuador, were made in New York. We sued in New York. Texaco tried to get the case back to Ecuador where they had never been held accountable, where they knew the indigenous peoples had no money or resources to find lawyers.”</p>



<p>“They thought it would just go away,” said Donziger. “Over a 10-year period, we battled to get a jury trial in the United States. Ultimately, they won that part of the battle. It went down to Ecuador.”</p>



<p>“We started working with a team of Ecuadoran lawyers in the early 2000s. We went forward with the lawsuit. We produced voluminous scientific and testimonial evidence, showing that they caused probably the world’s worst oil pollution. It was called the ‘Amazon Chernobyl’ by locals and experts. They dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic waste. They did it deliberately to save money. This was unlike the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was a terrible accident, even though it was a product of horrendous negligence by BP. This was done by design to pollute, knowing that people would die, and that indigenous groups would be decimated, and that this beautiful part of the Amazon would be destroyed.”</p>



<p>The refusal to abide by even minimal environmental regulations saved Texaco an estimated $3 on every barrel of oil produced over 26 years (1964-1992), <a href="https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0625-chevrons-corrupt-legal-practices-called-out-by-leading-human-rights-and-environmental-ngos">according to Amazon Watch</a>, or an estimated extra $5 billion in revenue. The hundreds of waste pits the company eventually abandoned in Ecuador, on average, contain 200 times the contamination allowed by typical global standards.</p>



<p>“They tried to grind us down using classic corporate defense tactics,” Donziger said of the legal war. “They filed thousands of motions. We stood strong. We had a great legal team of Ecuadorian lawyers.”</p>



<p>In the end, they won a stunning victory, a rare moment of accountability for first-world conglomerates who rape the environment of developing nations by exploiting weak, corrupt governments.</p>



<p>“The verdict came down, about $18 billion in favor of the affected communities, which is what it would take at a minimum to clean up the actual damage and compensate the people for some of their injuries. That eventually got reduced on appeal in Ecuador to $9.5 billion, but it was affirmed by three appellate courts, including the highest court of Ecuador. It was <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/ecuadorians-can-sue-chevron-in-canada-supreme-court-rules/">affirmed by the Canadian Supreme Court</a>, where the Ecuadorians went to enforce their judgment in a unanimous opinion in 2015.”</p>



<p>Chevron, as the evidence mounted against it, sold their assets in Ecuador and left the country. The corporation threatened the plaintiffs with <a href="https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-calls-for-dismissal-of-ecuador-lawsuit">a “lifetime of litigation”</a> if they attempted to collect, and, according to internal Chevron memos, launched a legal and media campaign that has cost an estimated $2 billion to prevent payment of the settlement and to demonize and destroy Donziger.</p>

<p>Donziger came to his epic battle against Chevron through journalism. “I was a journalist on my college newspaper,” he said of his time as a history major at American University. “My first job out of college was as a journalist with [United Press International]. I worked for UPI in Washington. They were strong in Latin America. I traveled to Managua in 1983 or 1984, I don’t remember exactly, and found work in the UPI bureau. I was 23 years old. I worked in the UPI bureau in Managua during the Sandinista era.”</p>



<p>He left UPI after a year in Managua but stayed on in Nicaragua to work as a freelance journalist for newspapers such as <em>The Fort Lauderdale News, The Toronto Star</em> and <em>The Atlanta Constitution</em>. He spent about three years as a reporter before going to Harvard Law School. When he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, he worked as a public defender in Washington, D.C. He documented Iraqi civilian casualties in Iraq following the first Gulf War that became a report adopted by the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A classmate at law school was from Ecuador. His classmate’s father organized a trip in April 1993 for lawyers and medical professionals to look at the contamination caused by the oil extraction in the Amazon. That trip, which Donziger joined, spawned the suit against Texaco. He would make more than 250 trips to Ecuador over the next two decades.</p>



<p>“Journalism significantly shaped my views and skill set,” he said. “It was vital to allowing my work to be successful. From the beginning this was a unique litigation, for many reasons, but one of the reasons was we, as a team, decided to work across multiple platforms. If we only saw this case as a lawsuit we would never win.”</p>



<p>“Chevron controlled the legal system in Ecuador with their influence. We needed to operate across different platforms, including engaging with the media and carrying out significant public education. Most Ecuadoreans, other than those who lived in the region, knew nothing about the pollution that had been happening in their country. We carried out zealous advocacy in the public arena. We realized that the indigenous people would never get a fair trial in Ecuador if they did not illuminate what had happened to them and get public support.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that I am detained shows how far we’ve come and how much risk Chevron feels. It’s not a sign we lost. It’s the opposite.”</p><cite>Steven Donziger</cite></blockquote>



<p>Both the judge who oversaw its lawsuit against Donziger for “racketeering” and Chevron itself “claim that this type of activity is wrong,” he said. “The irony is that what we were doing is what the big oil companies have always done. They always operate in the public relations domain, lobbying Congress to pass legislation to extinguish various legal claims, meeting political leaders …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">Bootstrap 5 Alpha</a>&nbsp;was released in June 2020. The new Bootstrap removes jQuery and no longer supports Internet Explorer (IE). The team said it’s time to move on from “what’s outdated or no longer appropriate”.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap framework</a>, originally developed and open-sourced by Twitter, has been an indispensable tool for web developers. It provides a ready-to-use set of UI components and a grid system essential for adaptive web pages that need to display well across PC and mobile browsers. Since its inception, Bootstrap has always had a dependency on the jQuery framework. The&nbsp;<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery framework</a>, originally created in 2006, is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks of all time. It provides powerful language features and cross-browser compatibility in an era when web technologies are going through many challenges and experimentations to support a variety of use cases ranging from interactive web pages, single-page apps, AJAX requests, and mobile web apps.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2020, with JavaScript standards and dominant web browsers already supporting most of the features in jQuery, the Bootstrap team decided to move on. The Bootstrap 5 framework has removed jQuery as a requirement. It saved 85KB of minified JavaScript, which could be significant as Google starts to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/search-ads-speed">use page speed as a ranking factor for mobile web sites</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html">soon for desktop web sites</a>&nbsp;as well. The Bootstrap team does this because Bootstrap 5 also no longer supports&nbsp;Internet Explorer. The team noted that all supported browsers provide jQuery replacement features in vanilla JavaScript. The decision to drop Internet Explorer is probably due to the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide">IE’s market share has now dropped below 3% even among Desktop PC users</a>.</p>



<p>Developer&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/">Flavio Copes</a>&nbsp;has an article on&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/jquery/">“Should you use or learn jQuery in 2020.”</a>&nbsp;In it, he pointed out vanilla JavaScript replacements from jQuery’s most popular features. Here are some examples.</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>Selecting DOM elements using the # or . notation:&nbsp;<code>document.querySelector('.button')</code></li><li>Waiting for page DOM to load:&nbsp;<code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =&gt; { ... })</code></li><li>Executing AJAX requests:&nbsp;<code>fetch('/api.json').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(body =&gt; console.log(body))</code></li></ul>



<p>If developers create a new web application in 2020, jQuery will&nbsp;probably no longer be necessary. The web has finally evolved beyond jQuery.</p>



<p>Another benefit of dropping IE is that Bootstrap 5 supports CSS custom properties. They make CSS more flexible and even programmable. For some examples, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/tables/#how-do-the-variants-and-accented-tables-work">docs on how to style tables</a>&nbsp;in Bootstrap 5.</p>



<p>Besides dropping jQuery, Bootstrap 5 also brings some notable features. Bootstrap 5 has an updated UI look and feel to focus more on-page content. It has a redesigned and better-looking set of custom form controls. It also has a new logo and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/26/bootstrap-icons-alpha5/">300+ additional icons</a>. For web sites that make heavy use of icons, the new SVG sprite allows developers to load all icons in a single SVG file and then use them as needed. That will likely increase web site performance and improve HTML readability.</p>



<p>The Bootstrap framework is open-source software available under the MIT license. Submitting bugs and fixes of&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5 alpha</a>&nbsp;to the team via its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/twbs">GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;are welcomed.</p>

<p>While it might not be a household name (yet), Stripe has quietly been taking over the world of online payments. In fact, if you’re reading this post, there’s a good chance you’ve already made a purchase via Stripe (even if you didn’t know it).</p>



<p>In the past year,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jdewitt29/status/1050017508516876289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">84%</a>&nbsp;of U.S. adults purchased something via Stripe. And when you consider that there are now more than&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/us/customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million</a>&nbsp;businesses using Stripe to process payments, it’s easy to see how that 84% figure became a reality.</p>

<p>Of course, Stripe’s success didn’t happen overnight. The company’s co-founders, brothers Patrick Collison and John Collison, started the company in 2010 after dropping out of college and receiving a seed investment from Y Combinator (the startup accelerator program). And while older brother Patrick, Stripe’s CEO, was 21-years-old when they founded Stripe, and younger brother John, Stripe’s president, was 19, this wasn’t their first rodeo. They sold a previous company, Auctomatic, for $5 million in 2008, back when Patrick was 19 and John was just 17.</p>



<p>Flash forward to 2018 and Patrick and John Collison are two of the youngest billionaires in the world. After raising $245 million in September of 2018, their company Stripe is now valued at $20 billion – 4,000x more than what their first company had been worth.</p>

<p>When you look at this incredible level of&nbsp;hypergrowth&nbsp;that Stripe has been able to achieve, it begs the obvious question:</p>



<p><strong>How the heck did they do it?</strong></p>



<p>In this post, we’ll dive deep into how Stripe was able to go from $0 to $20 billion in less than a decade. Ultimately, there are four key lessons all companies can benefit from implementing:</p>



<ol><li>Solve a real problem.</li><li>Obsess over customer experience.</li><li>Have a vision for the future.</li><li>Read books…lots of books.</li></ol>



<h2>1) Solve a real problem.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe generated word-of-mouth around their new product.</strong></p>



<p>When the Collisons launched their first company, Auctomatic, back in 2007, they came to an unexpected realization. They realized that the hardest part of starting an online business wasn’t coming up with an idea, or coding that idea into reality, or marketing that idea to potential customers. Instead, as John explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “The hardest part was finding a way to accept customers’ money.”</p>



<p>At the time, the largest eCommerce companies invested in building their own systems for processing payments online. But for scrappy startups (like Auctomatic), this wasn’t a viable solution. Doing so was too expensive and required weeks of back-and-forth with the bank. So instead, many of those startups turned to PayPal, which promised to make accepting online payments easier. Only…it didn’t. To the Collisons, PayPal still felt unnecessarily clunky and complex, and it came with too many regulations and setup fees. For developers who wanted to get payments up-and-running on a website quickly and easily, there was still no solution on the market.&nbsp;<strong>At a time when every other aspect of starting an online business had become easier, accepting payments remained complicated.</strong></p>



<p>And that’s how the idea for&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;– “a developer-focused, instant-setup payment platform that [can] scale to any size” – was born. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>, “Stripe really did come about because we were really appalled by how hard it was to charge for things online.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.004.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>In 2011, the year the Collisons officially launched Stripe, they visited PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and told them, in a nutshell, that PayPal was outdated and broken. Then, the Collisons asked them for money…and got it. Recognizing the issues the Collisons saw with the current online payments infrastructure were legitimate, Thiel and Musk led Stripe’s $2 million Series A round of fundraising that same year alongside Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>



<p>Talk about a gutsy move. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “It’s a little impetuous to go to PayPal founders and say payments on the internet are totally broken. But look, you can WhatsApp anyone around the world and it’s free. It’s a remarkable act of coordination between the telcos and ISPs and the people who own the fiber underneath the sea to create this global communications network. Then, if you look at the economic infrastructure, we haven’t even started.”</p>



<p>The Collison brothers didn’t set out to revolutionize the world of online payments processing when they founded Stripe. Instead, they set out to solve the legitimate problem they faced as developers and entrepreneurs. And, as it turns out, they weren’t alone. Fellow developers and entrepreneurs who were part of the same accelerator program (remember Y Combinator) were experiencing the same problem and soon began adopting Stripe in droves – and they began telling their friends about it.</p>



<p>For the first couple of years, word of mouth among developers was the lifeblood of Stripe’s business. As Patrick explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/939/168-tz-interview-patrick-collison-stripe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechZing</a>, “Initially it very much spread through a word of mouth process. That was surprising to us because it’s a payment system not a social network so it’s not something you’d think would have any virality whatsoever. But it became clear that everything else was so bad and so painful to work with that people actually were selling this to their friends.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.005.jpeg" alt="Patrick Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>It’s clear that the spark that got Stripe’s growth started was identifying a legitimate problem that resonated with lots of people. But in order to maintain the word of mouth that accompanied Stripe’s launch, and in order to keep that word of mouth positive, Stripe couldn’t simply rest on its laurels: It needed to invest in delivering a stellar customer experience, both for its own customers and for its customers’ customers.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.drift.com/summit/revgrowth-virtual-experiences/"></a>2) Obsess over customer experience.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe attracted its biggest accounts, like Lyft.</strong></p>



<p>Developers who switch from legacy payments processing systems to Stripe notice the difference in experience&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>. For starters, installing Stripe on a website or in an app requires copying and pasting just seven lines of code – that’s it! A process that once took weeks can now happen in a single day.</p>



<p>As John explained in an interview with NPR, “We have lots of stories of people integrating payments in an afternoon or an evening and then launching their business the next day. And that just worked consistently.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.006.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>Of course, that installation experience is essential to what makes Stripe such an effective product. As you read in the previous section, developers had been longing for a payments solution they could quickly and easily plug into their own products, and Stripe delivered.</p>



<p>In addition to making their installation process a breeze, Stripe made their entire end-to-end customer experience as enjoyable as possible. For example, Stripe’s documentation is famously clear and concise, which makes it easy for developers to find answers to any questions they might have. Stripe also regularly hosts meetups, hackathons, and other events where developers can talk about their experiences with Stripe and share best practices.</p>



<p>Stripe did such a good job of building goodwill around its brand that when it started sending out welcome packages to new customers, which included Stripe-branded stickers and t-shirts,&nbsp;<em>developers actually wore those t-shirts</em>. As Facebook product manager Morgan Brown wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/how-stripe-marketed-to-developers-so-effectively" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growth Hackers</a>&nbsp;article, the Stripe swag “only fueled the positive vibes developers had of the company. These t-shirts were worn proudly and the care packages shared on social media, mostly from developer recipients to other developers who they were connected to online.”</p>



<p>And while it’s easy to see how Stripe’s focus on customer experience helped the service become even more popular among developers, we’re still only looking at one half of the Stripe experience. Because in addition to reimagining the way sellers accepted payments online, Stripe also reimagined the way buyers pay for things online. In other words, Stripe isn’t just concerned about the experiences its customers have, it’s also concerned about the experiences its customers’ customers have.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Paypal, Stripe doesn’t insert itself into the buying process. Instead, it works behind the scenes, which means buyers never have to leave a company’s checkout page or enter some third-party-branded workflow in order to complete a transaction. When you buy something from a company via Stripe, Stripe gets out of the way and does its job in the background. It’s seamless – there are no interruptions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as a seller, using Stripe means you get to maintain a one-to-one connection with your buyer. As Stripe’s Chief Business Officer, Bill Alvarado, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>&nbsp;back in 2012: “You look at Google Checkout, you look at PayPal – they get in the way of the product. In many ways, Google and PayPal are trying to create their own relationship with your customer. I think that’s the thing that Stripe has done right. We’ve designed this for fast use, yes, but also so that you can retain control of your experience, your product, and your customers.”</p>



<p>It’s this dedication to customer experience that led to Stripe win deals with major companies, like Facebook, Google, Slack, Salesforce.com, Shopify, Target, OpenTable, Yelp, and Lyft. Case in point: When the Collison brothers were asked in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=608512576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>&nbsp;interview how Stripe was able to get a company like Lyft’s attention, John responded that the fundamental and most important thing was that Stripe “enabled product experiences that they wanted to have.”</p>



<p>Specifically, with Lyft, the ride-sharing service needed a system that allowed them to both charge their customers&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;pay their drivers – something that didn’t exist yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>It’s time for another Gleam release! This time as well as taking a look at
what’s new in the compiler, we’re going to take a look at what’s new in the
wider Gleam ecosystem too.</p>

<h2 id="record-update-syntax">Record update syntax</h2>

<p>Previously when we wanted to update some of the fields on the record we would
need to create a new instance and manually copy across the fields that have
not changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span>
    <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span>
    <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.name</span><span>,</span>
    <span>species</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span>
    <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.item</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite verbose! Worse, it’s error prone and annoying to type every
time.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton">Quinn Wilton</a> has
added the record update syntax to Gleam, so now we only need to specify the
fields that change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>pokemon</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span> <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All data in Gleam is immutable, so this syntax does not alter the values of
the existing record, instead it creates a new record with the original values
and the updated values.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> has added some new features to
Gleam’s numbers.</p>

<p>There’s now syntaxes for binary, octal, and hexadecimal int literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 4 ways of writing the int 15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hexadecimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xF</span>
<span>let</span> <span>decimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>octal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>o17</span>
<span>let</span> <span>binary</span> <span>=</span> <span>0b00001111</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These might be handy in many situations such as when implementing
<a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/gleam-chip8">a virtual machine</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lpil/tetromino">a game of tetris</a> in Gleam.</p>

<p>Underscores can now be added to numbers, making larger numbers easier to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>billion</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000</span>
<span>let</span> <span>trillion_and_change</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000_000</span><span>.</span><span>57</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="type-holes">Type holes</h2>

<p>Type holes can be used to give partial annotations to values.</p>

<p>Here we’re saying that <code>x</code> is a List, but we’re not saying what type the list
contains, leaving the compiler to infer it.</p>



<p>This may be useful when adding annotations for documentation or to use a more
restrictive type than would be inferred by the compiler, as you can leave out
any parts of the annotation that are not important to you there.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-improvements">Compiler improvements</h2>

<p>The majority of the compiler work in this release has been improvements to
existing features.</p>

<p>The formatter style has been improved in several ways, and the performance of
the formatter has been improved. One popular change is to how it formats
assignments that don’t fit on a single line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>
  <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Now</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better!</p>

<p>Additionally several error messages have been improved to include more
information on how to fix the problem, and a whole bunch of bug have been
squashed. Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for
more detail.</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>

<p>Outside of the compiler the big new thing in Gleam is the first release of
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http">Gleam HTTP</a>. Inspired by existing libraries such as Ruby’s Rack,
Elixir’s Raxx, and Haskell’s WAI, Gleam HTTP provides a single well-typed
interface for creating web applications and clients while keeping the
underlying HTTP client and server code modular.</p>

<p>In Gleam a HTTP service is a regular function that takes a HTTP request and
returns a HTTP response, where request and response are types defined by the
HTTP library.</p>

<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

<p>Here’s a simplistic service that echoes back any body sent to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Request</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_service</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.response</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a normal Gleam function it is easy to test this service, no special test
helpers or test server are required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>should</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_req_body</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>my_app</span><span>.service</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.status</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.body</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gleam’s HTTP library also provides middleware, which can be used to add
additional functionality to a HTTP service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>bit_builder</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>middleware</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>service</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my_app</span><span>.echo_service</span>
  <span>// Add a header</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.prepend_resp_header</span><span>(</span><span>"made-with"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Gleam"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Convert the response body type</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.map_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>bit_builder</span><span>.from_bit_string</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Support PATCH, PUT, and DELETE from browsers</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.method_override</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="running-a-service">Running a service</h4>

<p>Once we have defined a service we want to run the service with a web server so
that it can handle HTTP requests from the outside world. To do this we use a
HTTP server adapter, such as one for the <a href="https://github.com/elli-lib/elli">Elli Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>elli</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>elli</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or one for the <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>

I am many things: Husband, Father, Designer, Developer, Entrepreneur, and Interior House Painter to name a few. My wife and I have been married since 2016 and have two boys (10 and 12). We live in Castle Rock Colorado, which is located about 30 minutes South of Denver. I am originally from Iowa, have lived in Minnesota, and of course now Colorado.</p><p>I have two degrees, one in design and another in 3D Animation. I have also studied computer science, photography, pottery, and grew up helping my dad build and remodel things. <em>(He is a carpenter/cabinet builder.)</em></p><p>In September of 2018, I stepped away from my design and development career and started my own interior house painting company which has continued to be extremely successful and continues to grow. In my free time, I focus on my own personal, digital products to relax and hopefully, one day will be my primary focus and revenue source.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-making">What are you making?</h2><p>As many people know, I make a lot of things, of which you can check out here: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.krazier.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RVfOCL3YgTIhIkAVAXbe8">https://www.krazier.com</a> but the one I spend a lot of my time on and has been growing the fastest is Retrospect. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.retrospect.team&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18nsSYhG0Y9pINGNtWMKO0">https://www.retrospect.team</a></p><p>Retrospect is a real-time collaboration tool for retrospectives, tasks, and ideas.</p><h2 id="how-did-the-idea-for-your-product-come-to-mind">How did the idea for your product come to mind?</h2><p>I was working for a company a couple of years ago and we needed a tool to do retrospectives and the existing solutions we found were not designed well and didnâ€™t work all that great, not to mention the bigger solutions costing a lot of money to use for a relatively small need that we had. I set out to build a simple, affordable solution that looked good too.</p><h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-make-your-product">What inspired you to make your product?</h2><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wmkyhgs67HaZAalvciwqT6cj56V3OKmQQdK9SojC05r4XwoelQxx7YjFCk3t_Hst_HHV7-yXuXpD8FqWziizHUeAMW6T-BTTbfeGwVC8m2p-iNoaXEsFipWMuIoytQ"><figcaption>Retrospect.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, it was originally out of necessity, but it is become a bit of a passion project to see just how far I can take it. With the Covid19 lockdown situation, this type of tool has only become more important for businesses to take advantage of.</p><p>Retrospect is purposefully â€œsimpleâ€�, we did not set out to make another Trello or Asana type of tool. Those tools are great and are a nice compliment to what we are building. One important focus for us has been â€œanonymityâ€� in the product. With Retrospectives, it is important to be able to provide critical feedback, it can be hard to do that if there is the potential for your co-workers to get upset with something you may have said. With Retrospect, everything you publish to a board is kept anonymous so that you can give that critical feedback without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Retrospect will always be affordable; we want this service to be approachable to as many people as possible while still being worth our time financially. We provide great pricing and a great solution and hope people will recognize that and find value in what we offer.</p><blockquote>I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</blockquote><h2 id="why-embark-on-the-maker-s-journey">Why embark on the makerâ€™s journey?</h2><p>I have always enjoyed building things, from Legos and plastic models to do-it-yourself projects around the house and of course digital designs and products. We live in a world that is very digital and very accessible for anyone to learn to design or code their own software. With tools like Makerlog, we can now share our progress, connect with other makers, and build things together. By nature, building software is often an â€œindividualâ€� thing to do, so having resources to connect with others makes the journey a lot more fun and open to learning from so many types of people.</p><p>A lot of people have a bit of an ambition to make something, whether it is art, electronics, gardening, woodworking, jewelry, or software. It is a way for us to get away from the day-to-day requirements in our lives and focus on something that we love to do without the stress of having to do it for anyone else. I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-of-your-product">How do you see the future of your product?</h2><p>Retrospect has come a long way since the initial launch about two years ago, we have provided more permissions, more functionality, and improved the experience. The future has a lot of potential for new features and growth.</p><p>With the number of projects, I work on, I tend to push out a lot of smaller updates rather than huge feature releases. It is easier for us to manage and it also does not overwhelm our uses with huge UI changes that might make the tool unexpectedly harder for them to use.</p><p>As we continue to push out updates, our user audience will continue to expand. At first, our focus was on â€œretrospectivesâ€� which mostly development teams would find value in, the average person does not need a retrospective tool in their day-to-day lives. We are working towards making this a tool that has a useful impact on a daily level both professionally and personally. This means new types of functionality and a refreshed focus on our marketing and branding. Some of which will be happing over the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="as-of-today-what-are-your-stats">As of today, what are your stats?</h2><p>As of today, our stats areâ€¦</p><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> 6,290</li><li><strong>Boards:</strong> 3,925</li><li><strong>Cards:</strong> 48,947</li><li><strong>Monthly Pageviews:</strong> 10K+</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $2K+ (We will be switching to a subscription model soon.)</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-use-makerlog">How do you use Makerlog?</h2><p>I post my daily updates but try to focus on important tasks rather than â€œI had a coffee todayâ€�, I do not want to spam the feed with things that are not important to know. I read most of the discussions and contribute when it makes sense.</p><p>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter). I feel like I have some lifelong friends despite having never met anyone in person, yet.</p><blockquote>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter).</blockquote><h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-of-being-a-maker">What are the biggest challenges of being a maker?</h2><p>The life of a maker is basically learning to deal with challenges daily, things you never would have thought you have to deal with. The bigger, more obvious challenges are lack of motivation, lack of revenue, and plain old fear.</p><p>Motivation, as makers we are by default motivated to work on things, that is what makes us a maker in the first place. The challenge comes into play when you have been working on something for a long time and it just feels like it will never be completed. There is always that â€œone more thingâ€� to do, person to reach out to, reason not to go live. When you do almost everything yourself, you simply get exhausted and lack of motivation is inevitable. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a bad thing, it just means you need to learn how to renew that motivation to push forward. For me I like to go to or watch movies, it is one easy way for me to reset my mind and get back into thigs. I also like to clean my desk or house, make a list of every task I have, and then work through the easy ones as fast as possible since lack of motivation often comes from knowing you should be doing something else so you end up doing nothing at all. If you can get the easy things done, then it helps you get motivated again.</p><p>Lack of revenue, this is a devastating challenge to a lot of people. We often see those â€œovernight successâ€� stories, that usually are not overnight. Though, these days we are seeing a lot of people who will literally build something one day and have a lot of success the next, the question is how long-term is that success? The obvious goal of being a maker is to generate revenue so you can get away from that 9-5 job, the unobvious issue is that it can take years to get enough revenue to do that. A lot of people do not realize this fact and give up too early and go back to what they were doing before. We also canâ€™t â€œdo it allâ€� so we often have to hire some pieces out, if you have no revenue, this becomes a big burden and can literally prevent you from even finishing your project.</p><p>Fear, people have a lot of fear in their minds. It is an important thing to be aware of and work on as being maker means dealing with a lot of unknowns. Fear is a good motivator though; it can force you to learn something faster than you thought possible. When I first started launching products, I was scared to death. Now that I have launched so many projects, I barely stress out at all. It just comes with practice and experience to get over or at least manage your fears.</p><p>You are likely not able to cause too much damage with something you build, so go out and build something, launch it, and learn from it. The more you do it, the more interesting it becomes.</p><blockquote>The more you fail the more you learn.</blockquote><h2 id="managing-so-many-projects-how">Managing so many projects, how?</h2><p>As of right now, I have 11 public projects plus my day job, plus several new projects I am working on and my #MakerMillion journey. It looks like a lot, it is a lot, but it is not as crazy as it sounds.</p><p>Retrospect is my primary focus; I spend the most time on this project compared to any other one I have (outside of my day job). Everything else sort of just â€œruns itselfâ€�, I have very little time commitment reserved for them on a day-to-day basis. Yes, I work on them, but it is not a constant, urgent requirement. Some things I have not hardly touched in months, partly because I am focused on other things and partly because I just lose interest in them for a while.</p><p>I work in cycles and sprints, I will come up with a feature idea, work hard on it for a week or two, launch it and then move onto the next thing. I do this over and over across all my projects. If I tried to focus on one thing, for a long time, I would get super bored with it, I like having the ability to jump around. This approach very likely prevents me …</p></div></div>

August 28, 2020 | https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It has been a very productive and interesting journey creating Labcodes’ design system: there are always challenges and something new to learn. One thing we are doing is making sure we have our research and study references documented, alongside with the team's design choices, so we can have consistency throughout the components, and, mainly, a unison connection with our design principles. </p>
<p>One topic that always finds a way to catch my attention is the user interface short texts, and I was responsible, in our design system project, for the conception of the notifications, buttons and dropdown menu components. In common, they require guidelines and rules for writing its labels, in case of menu and buttons, and longer messages, for banners and toasts.</p>
<p>I remember that a long time ago, in the first versions of a mobile application that I don't remember which one, I read somewhere on the internet (sorry for the lack of references) about a change made to the interface: the term “my library” was set to “your library ”. OK! But what's interesting about that?</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the software began to communicate directly with its users. In the example, instead of considering the library as belonging to the system, the system now reports that the library belongs to the user. This change shows how short texts details change the reader's perception of a product. Below I will return to this subject.</p>
<h2>Writing labels</h2>
<p>Labels are commands applied to interface elements such as menus, tags, buttons, text inputs and other interface elements. They directly address users by communicating something or requesting an action. These commands are associated with interactive flows, normally change the system's state, and must be brief, informative and extremely clear. (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-copy/">adapted from n/n group</a>)</p>
<p><em>Each company has its own brand guide, which should present the tone and voices that the organization’s written communication should have. You can use it as a basis for writing according to how your company does it. Applying these rules, as well as other good writing practices, are a great path for good results. Here at Labcodes we have our own writing guide, which helps us a lot.</em></p>
<p>Following this reasoning, our design system's buttons have labels that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must communicate exactly what will happen when the user interacts with this component.</li>
<li>Only the first letter of the label's sentence is capitalized, as well as any other specific noun that requires capitalization.</li>
<li>They are as short as possible, preferably with a maximum of 3 words.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As difficult as it is to reduce actions labels to just 3 words, we chose to keep this rule as a </em>challenge in order to train our synthesis skills and communicate what really matters.*</p>
<p>For action menus we use some specific rules, but they are also applicable to buttons and other label categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use verbs and imperative phrases to describes the action triggered by the interaction. Never use verbs alone, always alongside a noun. For example: “Move item”, “Edit description”, “Get help". </li>
<li>Use nouns for actions that navigates to other pages (navigation actions/links). For example: “Keyboard shortcuts”, “Profile editor", “System settings”.</li>
<li>Don't use articles. They can complexify something that is simpler, increasing the length of a line, in addition to generating other unwanted effects. For example: write “Add bookmark” instead of “Add a bookmark”.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let's take a step back to when I mentioned how short texts can change the perception of a product. Be aware when labeling system or user's owned items. A good example is to write “Your settings” instead of “My settings” since we are talking about user's preferences, that, even being stored by the system, they are still personal choices. This very naming choice shows attention to detail by making explicit product core values and showing who is in charge.</em></p>
<p><em>The dialogue between the system and its users must be direct, clear and friendly. When writing texts for interfaces, imagine the system as an experienced technical person talking to a non-technical person who needs to know what to do next, explaining a question in an understandable way, without making the experience dense or scary.</em></p>
<p>Something important to consider when writing button labels is the use of terms such as "Ok", "Yes", "No", "Finish", which does not have an explicit meaning for its triggered actions. It may be nice to spell out the actions that will be performed as the use of generic terms can cause difficulties in understanding or lead the user to take an action that they will regret.  </p>
<p>Most users typically press buttons or select actions without paying much attention to what they are doing. To avoid these inconveniences, in potentially destructive actions or that could cause an error, always provide a way to undo the action and use clear labels that help the user to recognize the options of "Undo", "Cancel", "Interrupt". In some cases, it may be useful to add a second confirmation layer to avoid data loss.</p>
<p><em>In common cases, there is simply not enough space in an application to accommodate commands with long labels, so, just repeating here the reminder to keep everything very simple. Consider it as a mantra and always ask yourself if it can be simplified further without losing clarity. Give preference to labels with only one line of text that contain up to 4 words.</em></p>
<h2>The design model for user interface texts</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/text-ui#a-design-model-for-ui-text">Microsoft has very interesting material on a design model for interface texts:</a></p>
<p>“As you think about UI text and its placement on your UI surfaces, consider these facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>During focused, immersive reading, people read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).</li>
<li>When using software, users aren't immersed in the UI itself but in their work. Consequently, users don't read UI text, they scan it.</li>
<li>When scanning a window, users may appear to be reading text when in reality they are filtering it. They often don't truly comprehend the UI text unless they perceive the need to.</li>
<li>Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users tend to read static text only when they think they need to.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“For a general design model, don't assume that users carefully read the text in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. Rather, assume that users start by quickly scanning the whole window, then read UI text in roughly the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive controls in the center</li>
<li>The commit buttons</li>
<li>Interactive controls found elsewhere</li>
<li>Main instruction</li>
<li>Supplemental explanations</li>
<li>Window title</li>
<li>Other static text in main body</li>
<li>Footnotes”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should also assume that, once users decide what to do, they immediately stop reading any text and take action.</strong></p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>Behavior, for me, is always something very fascinating that holds my attention. I always try, like our whole team, to produce content that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>Making available information clear is crucial to the decision-making process and guidance on interfaces, and in many cases the displayed information is scarce, garbled or the environment presents misplaced, wrong or contradictory messages, leading the user to fall back to more instinctive techniques such as trial and error, or luck.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered that the orientation process within an interface depends, in addition to its structure, on the way that texts and micro texts are written? In the next post, I will bring the lessons and our decisions to these short texts applied in notifications such as banners and toasts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do you have any questions, suggestions or want to start a conversation? The comments section is open, and we want to know what you think and your experiences on writing for interfaces! See you soon :)</p>

<p>I’ve been using WordPress CMS for more than 10 years now. I’ve seen its evolution from a blogging platform to a fully featured website builder.</p>



<p>In December 2018, WordPress launched <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg</a> editor. The community, including myself, received it with mixed feelings.</p>



<p>On the one hand it looked like something innovative, intended to change the way users create and publish content, on the other hand it seemed like an incomplete tool trying to improve something that was already working great.</p>



<div><p>I’m now writing this post using <a href="https://wpindigo.com/wordpress-gutenberg-vs-elementor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg editor</a> and there is nothing particularly wrong with it. However, I sometimes find it difficult to use and confusing, even after using it on a daily basis. It simply doesn’t provide the user experience I’m used to.</p><p>Overall, I don’t like Gutenberg. Let me explain why. There are so many little things that simply don’t work as required. Here are a few examples:</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>The UI is not intuitive</strong>  – important controls are hidden, there are too many useless options, the icons are confusing and not representative. I don’t need spotlight mode, top toolbar, cog icons and other useless features.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1269" height="535" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png" alt="gutenberg confusing icons" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png 1269w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-1024x432.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1269px) 100vw, 1269px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="605" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png" alt="gutenberg hidden options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png 1436w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-1024x431.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>I don’t need the Edit/Select mode</strong> – in previous versions I could select the content from all blocks and copy or move them. Now I have to change the mode from Edit to Select and then I’ll be able to do the same thing. </li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1136" height="286" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png" alt="gutenberg edit-select options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png 1136w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-300x76.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-1024x258.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-768x193.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>It’s not front-end editing</strong> – you add blocks in your back-end and preview them in the front-end. There is no way to edit blocks and other elements in the front end (except using the fullscreen mode which is not accurate).</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Block/pattern editing is a nightmare</strong> – if you’ve ever used <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> or any other decent page builder, you’ll understand what I mean. You can easily adjust a simple block like image or button, but when you have a more complex block, things get really complicated. It’s super hard to adjust elements and editing becomes a difficult task.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1427" height="621" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png" alt="gutenberg block-pattern editing" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png 1427w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-300x131.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-1024x446.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Embeds are useless</strong> – what’s the point to embed a Youtube video if you can’t adjust the width of the video or set up the autoplay option. You will anyway need to include the video via custom code.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Images</strong> – you can’t simply drag and drop multiple images at once, as in Classic Editor. Now, you have to create a gallery, select your images, post the gallery and adjust the columns. Used to be simpler and more efficient.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Issues</strong> – if something goes wrong, let’s say you create an HTML block and your code is not valid, WordPress will notify you and give you options to Resolve the issue. Why? I don’t need to convert this block, I just want to edit the HTML code, which is not possible without converting the block.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1143" height="581" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png" alt="gutenberg resolve block" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png 1143w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-300x152.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-1024x521.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1143px) 100vw, 1143px"></figure>



<p>I like changes, but why did they change something that was working really well? Looks like they are pushing this product further, without listening to the community and in my opinion it gets worse.</p>



<p>Thank God we have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Editor</a> and can use it for now. I hope that Gutenberg will improve and the team will make it more user friendly and easy to use. For now, I will never use it to create new pages or more complex layouts. I think that it’s way behind <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> and other page builders.</p>



<p>So, what do you think? Is Gutenberg a failure or a success? Please share your thoughts.</p>

<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/
Alg   Cost                  Salt                                            Hash</pre>



<ul><li><code>2a</code>: The hash algorithm identifier (Bcrypt)</li><li><code>10</code>: Cost factor (2<sup><code>10</code></sup>&nbsp;= 1,024 rounds of key expansion)</li><li><code>N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye</code>: 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters</li><li><code>IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy</code>: 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters</li></ul>



<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]
      block ^= saltHalf[(i-1) mod 2]

	  // Encrypt block using current key schedule with blowfish block encryption
	  block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block)
	  
	  // Split block and use as new subkeys
      pEighteenSubkeys[2*i] = block[0:31]
	  pEighteenSubkeys[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
   }

   // Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state
   for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i ++ {
      for j := 0; j &lt; 127; j++ {
		// Encrypt block using blowfish block encryption
		// where salt[i] is 64 bit chunks
        block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block ^ salt[i])
        sFourSubBoxes[2*i] = block[0:31]
		sFourSubBoxes[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
	  }
	}
    return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

<p><em>This is a series of notes on colour search design based on my experiences
desgining search interfaces for the lipstick search engine <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a>.
I will link other parts of the series here as they become available.</em></p>

<h2 id="simple-yet-flexible-the-design-of-the-query-page">Simple yet flexible: the design of the query page</h2>

<p>The initial design of the <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> search interface drew heavy inspiration
from the relative minimalism of the Google search engine front page, which
has a graphic, a search box and a few buttons as the main features.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_3.png" alt="Google Search Engine"></p>

<p><em>The design of Google’s text-based search engine is minimal.</em></p>

<p>However, one of the reasons that such a scarcity of elements works for Google’s usecase
is that text search is a good deal more simple than the search interface of a
niche colour search engine. Not only does the UI designer need to provide a suitable
UI element for choosing colours, this UI element also needs to account for the various textural
subtleties that a user may desire to search for.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-search-bar.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo features a minimal search bar.</em></p>

<p>In the case of lipcolours, a product has variation not only in the shade, but also in the finish.
The same colour can appear as metallic (the formula has a added element for high shine and reflectivity), shimmer (the formula is shiny with tiny sparkles), cream (not as shiny as metallic, but more reflective than matte) and matte, which is usually the most pigmented and least reflective form a lipcolour. These variations in texture need to be taken into account in the search query.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/lipglossdemo.gif" alt="Lipgloss"></p>

<p><em>Searching for a lipgloss in a particular shade on <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a></em></p>

<p>To capture this complexity (the solution described here is not perfect by any means and will certainly require more iterations), the initial colour search UI design for <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> featured
a colour wheel selector powered by the open source library iro.js and a drop down
control for adding desired finish and product type filters. For example, one could, if
desired search for lipstick and liquid lipstick products in a matte navy blue colour.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/navyblue.gif" alt="Navyblue"></p>

<p><em>Searching for navy blue lipsticks and liquid lips in a matter finish.</em></p>

<h2 id="displaying-the-search-results">Displaying the search results</h2>

<p>The next important step in the design of a colour search engine is the format of
the results. The initial inspiration was once again drawn from the world
of text based search engines where web pages that best match a user’s query are listed
in descending order.  Some search engines like Google paginate the results, while
others like DuckDuckGo offer an infinite-scroll-lazy-loading experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/google-pagination.png" alt="Paginated search results from Google"></p>

<p><em>UI design for paginating search results on Google</em></p>

<p>As the user scrolls down, the backend returns more and more results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-pagination.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo pagination"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo pagination is an infinite-scroll.</em></p>

<p>In addition to the results, the results pages of search engines usually also
display the original query, to help the user see what they searched for and how well what they found
with the help fo the search engine matches what they searched for.</p>

<p>The initial design of the colour search engine results followed the template above fairly closely.
The results page features a “You searched for” section that shows a coloured circle featuring the
colour the user chose from the colour wheel on the main page and then a list of results in a
descending similarity order. The closest colours (according to the colour search engines similarity metric) are listed first.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/searchresults.png" alt="Search resuslts"></p>

<p><em>Search results from the colour search engine feature the original query, the results in descending order of colour similarity as well as small cards with information.</em></p>

<p>Each search result is displayed with a small card that has a circular colour element that captures the colour of the product. In addition, each card has information about the brand, the product type and the finish.</p>

<h2 id="grid-like-results-to-facilitate-comparison">Grid-like results to facilitate comparison</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_4.png" alt="Results comparison"></p>

<p><em>One key task a user wants to do is to compare the results with the query. This is farily simple with a text search engine but harder when the query is a colour.</em></p>

<p>One of the main tasks that a user is interested in doing is comparing
the colour in the search query to the colour of the items
returned in the results to see how close the matches are to the query.
Thinking back to the results page of traditional text-based
web search engines, we can see that the pagination design (whether it’s
a traditional pagination UI or an infinitely scrolling UI) does not
interfere with the process of comparison that a user engages in.
We take the query we entered into the search engine and then scan
the results checking which one could potentially have useful
information related to the query. It’s relatively easy to keep
a text query in mind, so the paginated approach does not pose
a major hindrance to the user’s goal of comparing the query to the results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-pages.gif" alt="Mac Chili Paginated"></p>

<p><em>Paginated search results from the colour search engine. Keeping the exact query colour in mind and paginating to compare results can be hard.</em></p>

<p>However, keeping the exact shade of a colour (the colour in the query) in your mind and then scrolling
or paginating through each result card and comparing the colours is challenging.
You can see for yourself in the animated screencapture above.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-grid.gif" alt="Mac Chili Grid"></p>

<p><em>A grid design facilitates colour comparison.</em></p>

<p>One solution for this would be to dock the “You searched for” card at the top
of the screen while scrolling and thus facilitate quick and easy side by side
comparison. However, for the time being implementing this with the Bootstrap
framework proved too difficult, so instead I’ve opted for implementing a grid
of results with a side by side card arrangement that displays the queried
colour on the left and allows the user to populate the card on the right
with a search result from the grid.</p>

<p>I will be iterating more on this design in the near future and look forward
to sharing what I learn with you!

  <p>Google is an evil company. When they're not <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/11/google-facebook-surveillance-privacy/">surveilling billions of people</a>, they're <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/13/google-resumes-its-senseless-attack-on-the-url-bar-hides-full-addresses-on-chrome-canary/">trying to harm the web</a> or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations">firing employees for organizing</a>. My <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/full-stack-ethics">first entry on this blog</a> was about reasons to avoid Google products. I don't like Google!</p>
<p>The thing is, Google is everywhere, and Google is free. It's probably not much of an exaggeration to say that everyone who spends time online has used a Google service. In a lot of cases, they're the default option that people choose without thinking. At some point, I just decided to stop. No more Google in my life.</p>
<p>Is that even possible in 2020? Mostly!</p>
<p>Some Google services are easily replaced. Others are difficult because of network effects, and still others just don’t seem to have any good competitors that I’ve found.</p>
<p>So here are all the Google services I used to use, how easy it is to avoid them and what I use instead.</p>
<h3 id="google-search">Google search</h3>
<p>I thought this one would be okay, since it’s a big target. The most promising competitor here seems to be <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, but ultimately I’ve been disappointed by their search results. They're fine for easy queries, like if I type the exact name of what I’m searching for. More complex queries — for example, pasting an error message from my terminal — are not great. DuckDuckGo make it easy to search Google by prefixing a query with <code>g!</code>, which I end up doing far too often.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-chrome">Google Chrome</h3>
<p>If you've written it off in the past, you should revisit <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. It's fast, its developer tools are great and it aggressively blocks trackers and advertisers. As of writing this, it's blocked 339 trackers for me today.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus">Mozilla's recent layoffs</a> — including their <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveALee/status/1293487542382333952">developer tools team</a> — are worrying. If Firefox starts going downhill again, I'll probably switch to Safari. That would suck, though — Firefox is the last major bastion against the Webkit/Blink browser engine monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>I use an iPhone, so no problems here!</p>
<p>This might be a good time to mention that I have <a href="https://itep.org/fact-sheet-apple-and-tax-avoidance/">qualms</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-china-catcher-20180116-story.html">with</a> <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Apple</a>, too — but they seem to be the least worst of the two real choices for a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="gmail">Gmail</h3>
<p>There are a million and one email services, so I wasn’t expecting too much trouble with this one. Partially because my email address is <code>@jake.nyc</code>, not <code>@gmail.com</code>, so there was no annoying transition where everyone had to update their contact info.</p>
<p>I went with <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> ($50 per year on their annual plan) and I have no complaints. It was super easy to import all my emails from Gmail. The webmail and phone apps are both good — although because my work uses Gmail, I use <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a> in order to have all my email accounts in one app.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</h3>
<p>Fastmail email accounts come with a calendar, and it's interoperable with Google calendars. Or they're both compatible with some open standard; I'm not a calendar power user. Whatever the case, it works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h3>
<p>After the disastrous Apple Maps rollout, I was worried that this would be a tough one to replace. Not so! If you have an iPhone, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> gives you everything you want in a maps app. And their maps have <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-continental-united-states">gotten really good</a>. I'm happy to report that you can leave those fears in 2012.</p>
<p>If you're a city dweller like I am, there's an even better option: <a href="https://citymapper.com/">CityMapper</a>, which focuses specifically on public transit. They also have real-time transit alerts and offline maps. I use CityMapper whenever I'm taking public transit, and Apple Maps on the rarer occasion that I'm driving somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-docs">Google Docs</h3>
<p>The only two of these I really use are Docs and Sheets. I’m mostly able to cover everything with a combination of tools: <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> for prose, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> for general note-taking and <a href="https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a> for math related stuff. I would like to find a good full–featured spreadsheet replacement but so far that hasn’t been a huge obstacle.</p>
<p>The real issue is that I often use documents and spreadsheets with other people. And unfortunately, Google has built a nice little walled garden here. There's no easy way for me to collaborate with someone else without forcing them to also forego Google Docs. On top of that, other services build on top of Google's products. I use <a href="https://www.tillerhq.com/">Tiller</a> to stay on top of my spending, but they only support importing data into Google Sheets and Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h3>
<p>This is basically the same story as Google Docs, with the caveat that it's much less common for me to need a shared filesystem with someone. I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for myself, which usually suffices when I need to share a file. That said, it's still part of the same ecosystem as Google Docs, which makes it hard to avoid if you use the former.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Privacy conscious analytics services seem to be <em>en vogue</em> these days, so it wasn’t difficult to find a replacement I liked. I picked <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> and have been very happy with it. It’s $14 a month and you can put it on as many websites as you want; I have it powering both this site and <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of obscure metrics Google Analytics gives you that Fathom doesn’t have, but I’ve never missed them. Maybe I would if I were really into marketing data. But pageviews, uniques, referrers, time on site and bounce rate is enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>This one is a little weird, since the differentiating factor between YouTube and competitors is content rather than a set of features. I'm not a big YouTube user so it doesn’t bother me too much, but if someone sends me a video there’s basically no way for me to see it elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m rating this one “hard” because it’s basically irreplaceable, but as someone who doesn’t watch many YouTube videos anyway it doesn’t really affect me. Your mileage may vary!</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>

			<p>stumpled upon a bug in openssh … did a small config change in sshd_config, deployed it with ansible … and <strong>lost connectifity to all these boxes immediately</strong> … and of course, i did a config check before reloading the sshd daemon, and the config check was fine.</p>
<p>i can’t belife that nobody else found this before, as it’s really simple to reproduce. and it’s working with openbsd, debian, centos and mostly on all system which have opensshd implemented (and that’s a lot of …)</p>
<h2 id="reproduce-the-bug">reproduce the bug</h2>
<p>just add the following line to your sshd_config, do a config check and restart sshd. and you will not be able to login aging through ssh!</p>
<p><strong>DON’T TEST THIS ON YOUR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!</strong></p>
<p>you need a console and root login/password (or do some recovery procedures in single user mode) to fix this !</p>
<pre><code>root@debian:~# echo "Match Address 2001:db8::/16"  &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config
root@debian:~# echo "  AllowTcpForwarding yes"     &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre><p>check config and restart the service</p>
<pre><code>root@debian:~# sshd -t
root@debian:~# systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre><p>and you will not be able to login through ssh again.</p>
<pre><code>stoege@puffy200 ~$ ssh -l root debian
Connection closed by 10.1.2.3 port 22
stoege@puffy200 255 ~$
</code></pre><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>the problem is that you configured a host address instead of network address. this is not recognized by the config checker but by the sshd daemon itself.</p>
<p><strong>so, a simple Typo can bring your ssh daemon down! Reboot safe :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="ipv4">IPv4</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Match Address 192.168.1.0/24  -&gt; correct network statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Match Address 192.168.1.1/32  -&gt; correct host statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match Address 192.168.1.1/24  -&gt; break your ssh daemon</strong></p>
<p><strong>-&gt; you have either a wrong network mask or a wrong subnet declaration</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and the same with IPv6. and we’re all not that familiar with subnet calculation on v6, are we ?</p>
<h3 id="ipv6">IPv6</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Match Address 2001:db8:1000:2000::/56   -&gt; correct network statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Match Address 2001:db8:1000:2001::/128  -&gt; correct host statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match Address 2001:db8:1000:2001::/56   -&gt; break you ssh</strong></p>
<p><strong>-&gt; you have either a wrong network mask or a wrong subnet declaration</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="affected-versions">affected Versions</h3>
<p>hard to say. probably all OpenSSH Implemenations up to and including Version 8.3. So, all your SSH Boxes are definitly affected …</p>
<h3 id="patch-from-darren">Patch from Darren</h3>
<pre><code>Check that the addresses supplied to Match Address and Match
LocalAddress are valid when parsing in config-test mode.  This will
catch address/mask mismatches before they cause problems at runtime.

<h3 id="fixed">Fixed</h3>
<p>OpenBSD current got this patch included (29 Aug 2020) so the config checker will complain. OpenBSD 6.8, which will be released in Nov 2020  will not be affected anymore.</p>

<p>if you wanna know more about ssh stuff and how to protect your machines from unauthoized access, read the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">man Pages</a> or i can recommend the book “SSH Mastery: OpenSSH, PuTTY, Tunnels and Keys” from <a href="https://mwl.io/">Michael W. Lucas</a></p>
<h3 id="thanks">thanks</h3>
<p>i reported this bug to the community and they fixed it within 3 hours! big thanks to OpenBSD Community (who are responsible for the OpenSSH Daemon) and specially Darren Tucker for this quick reaction and fix.</p>
<p><strong>So, i will seriously care about my “Match Statements” in the near (and longer future) and you should do this as well !</strong></p>
<p>happy hacking !</p>

        <p><em>The integral of the secant is well known to any beginners calculus student. Yet this integral was once a major outstanding maths problem. It was first introduced by Geradus Mercator, who needed it to make his famous map, in 1569. He couldn’t find it, and used an approximation instead. The exact solution was found accidently 86 years later without calculus in 1645. It then took another two decades until a formal proof was given in 1668, 99 years after Mercator first proposed the problem.</em></p>

<p>As this <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/how-math-works">comic</a> by SMBC rightly teases, the history of mathematics is often not so straightforward. 
Theorems, formulas and notation that are routinely discussed in class, were once insights or accidents themselves.
This is the story of one such formula, the integral of the secant. 
I first read about it almost a decade ago<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, when I got interested in cartography: the science and art of mapmaking. 
This integral is of vital importance to the Mercator map, and therefore many online maps that use it, like <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<p>This story has been told several times before: see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3603395">1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> or <a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol7/iss2/12/">3</a>.
But these are all journal articles, consigned mostly to academics.
I want to present it here in a less formal and more colourful setting, to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>This is an article about mathematics, so familiarity with the following is helpful: algebra, trigonometry, radians and basic calculus. 
These are usually covered in advanced high school maths classes or first year maths courses.</p>

<h2 id="first-year-maths">First year maths</h2>

<p>In first year maths at university, after a month of differentiation, we were starting the inverse problem: integration. 
Differentiation  is the mathematics of finding gradient functions for curves.
Integration is the mathematics of inverting this - given a gradient function, what is the curve? 
My lecturer was introducing the integration of trigonometric functions.
He started off with:</p><p>

\[\int sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + c \:\text{  and } \int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + c\]

</p><p>This relationship made sense, because sine and cosine derivatives were opposites. Just had to be careful of minus signs. Next he derived the integral for the tangent:</p><p>

\[\int tan(x) dx = \int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}dx = -ln|cos(x)| + c\]

</p><p>Ok, that was tricky. It was not immediately obvious that the inverse of the chain rule could be used here, because the function $cos(x)$ was present with its derivative $sin(x)$.
But given enough thought, it made sense. Then he said, this is the integral of the secant, and learn it off by heart:</p><p>

\[\int sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + c\]

</p><p>OK, where did that come from? My lecturer offered no explanation. It was easy to verify that it worked by finding the derivative. 
(Paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> has a more complex proof using only integration.)
But how had he come up with that?</p>

<p>I think, at this point, most first year calculus students like me have the following fleeting thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Integration is much harder than differentiation.</li>
  <li>Some mathematician must have stumbled on this through differentiation first.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t matter anyway because where will I ever use this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, number 1 is true, as many a student can testify after writing a test. 
Number 2 is false - in fact it was found by a teacher while looking at raw numbers. 
Such a method for finding an integral is so unusual, that one might conjecture it is the <em>only</em> integral that has been found like this.
Surely in calculus class, where raw numbers are so rare, you would be laughed at if you attempted to solve an integral like that.
Lastly, number 3 remains true for me. But this doesn’t mean this integral isn’t useful - it is used to construct the Mercator map. 
That is why a teacher was crunching numbers when he serendipitously realised what the formula was.</p>

</figure>

<p>The secant is a standard trigonometric function. It is defined as the ratio of the hypotenuse $c$ to the adjacent side $a$ for an angle $\varphi$ in a right angled triangle.
In mathematical notation, the definition is:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{c}{a}\]

</p><p>It is the reciprocal of the more widely used cosine function:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{1}{cos(\varphi)}\]

</p><p>Here are the graphs of the secant and cosine for the angles from $-2\pi$ (-360°) to $2\pi$ (360°):</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/secant_graph.png" alt="Definition of the secant">
</figure>

<p>The integral of the secant can be interpreted as the area under the graph<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is illustrated by the shaded region.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-cartography">An introduction to cartography</h2>

<p>The earth, which is a sphere<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, cannot be projected onto a flat map without distortion. 
Over the years, cartographers have devised many different map projections which try to balance minimising distortion with other properties. 
They come in all shapes and sizes.
Lists of these projections can be found <a href="https://map-projections.net/singleview.php">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections">here</a>.
I will explain two of the simplest here, which will help with understanding the Mercator map in the next section.</p>

<p>All map projections can be represented as equations that transform spherical co-ordinates to flat map co-ordinates.
The co-ordinates on the sphere are the angles $\varphi$ and $\lambda$. These correspond to lines of latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridans) respectively. 
The co-ordinates on the flat map are $x$ and $y$. A map projection is therefore a transformation from $\varphi$ and $\lambda$ to $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and oldest known projections is the equirectangular projection:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular.png" alt="Equirectangular map">
	<figcaption>Equirectangular map. From <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/rectang-0">map-projections.net/singleviewp/rectang-0</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is made by mapping meridians and parallels to vertical and horizontal straight lines of constant spacing.
This has the affect of stretching out objects along the parallels.
The equations for this projection are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= R\varphi\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>While the equations are simple, the construction process can be hard to visualise. Here is my attempt:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular_construction.png" alt="Equirectangular map construction">
	<figcaption>A segment of the sphere is peeled off and flattened.
The right most image shows a top view of the flattening. The arcs are pulled flat in the longitudial direction, so that they become straight lines.
They do not change length in this process, but that requires stretching out the sides along the $x$-axis. 
Thus a single point where all the arcs meet, is stretched into a line.   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equirectangular map has a total area of $(2\pi R)(\pi R)=2\pi^2 R^2$ while the surface area of the sphere is $4\pi R^2$. 
Therefore this projection distorts the area by a factor of $\frac{\pi}{2}\approx1.57$.</p>

<p>A different kind of projection can be obtained by projecting lines from the sphere onto the mapping plane. 
An example is the Lambert cylindrical projection. 
It is made by wrapping a cylinder around the sphere and projecting points onto it via lines parallel to the $x$-axis. 
Here is a visualisation of this construction:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg" alt="Lambert cylindrical map construction">
	<figcaption>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg">Wikipedia</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here is a cross section of the sphere along side the final map:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Lambert_construction.png" alt="Lambert cylindrical  map">
	<figcaption>Lambert cylindrical  map. Edited from <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/lambert">map-projections.net/singleviewp/lambert</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equations are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= Rsin(\varphi)\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>For objects near the equator, this results in very little distortion, such as for Africa. But objects near the poles are compressed because of the sphere’s curvature. 
This can be seen clearly with Greenland.</p>

<p>This map has the useful property that its area is equal to the surface area of the sphere. Thus, while objects are distorted, their areas are still correct.
The relative scale of Greenland to Africa is therefore accurately represented in this map.</p>

<h2 id="the-mercator-map">The Mercator map</h2>

<p>In 1569, Gerardus Mercator wanted to make a global world map that would be useful for navigation. 
He lived in a time when sailing across vast ocean distances was the norm. (In 1492, Christopher Columbus had discovered America by sailing all the way from Spain.)
The maps shown above are fine for artistic impressions and applications, but not for navigation.
The distortions prevent doing any accurate distance and bearing measurements on the map. 
At a local level, lines (eg. roads) which in reality intersect perpendicularly to each other, would be appear to be slanted with respect to each other.</p>

<p>In particular, Mercator wanted to make a map where rhumb lines would be straight. Rhumb lines are curves of constant bearing relative to meridians. 
To follow a rhumb line, a navigator only needs to maintain the same bearing on their compass for the whole journey.
For example, here is the rhumb line through modern day New York and Cape Town:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/NY_to_CPT.png" alt="Arcs from NY to CPT">
	<figcaption>Made with software from <a href="https://imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals">imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals</a> and Inkscape </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At each point along the rhumb line, the angle $\theta$ with the meridian is 48.56°, which corresponds to a bearing of 311°26’18’’ from Cape Town to New York. 
I’ve also shown the great circle, which is a circle whose centre lies on the centre of the sphere. 
Travelling along the great circle is always shorter. In this case, the distance is 12550 km instead of 12600 km along the rhumb line.
With modern technology, it is easy for ships and aeroplanes to stick to the great circles. But back in Mercator’s day, this was rather difficult. 
So sailors preferred to stick to rhumb lines. They would rather get to their destination by travelling a little longer, then get lost and travel a lot more.</p>

<p>Mercator’s idea was to stretch out a cylindrical projection map in the North-South direction to preserve shapes and angles.
Looking at the Lambert projection<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, it can be seen that a different stretch factor is required for each latitude. At the equator, no stretch is required.
At the 45° parallel only a small amount of upward stretching is required. The objects close to the poles have to be stretched a lot to uncompress them.</p>

<p>This stretch factor can be calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Construction process for the Mercator map. Edited from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection"> Wikipedia</a> images </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First Mercator divided the globe into graticules of equal spacing $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\lambda$. 
Along the meridians, the arc length of each graticule is $R\delta\varphi$.
Along the parallels, the radius of the circle is …</p></div></div></div></div>

    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

<p><span>Kiwi start-up</span><a href="https://emrod.energy/"> <span>EMROD</span></a><span> has developed the world’s first long-range, high-power, wireless power transmission as an alternative to existing copper line technology.</span></p>
<p><span>The Emrod technology works by utilising electromagnetic waves to safely and efficiently transmit energy wirelessly over vast distances. The prototype received some government funding and was designed and built in Auckland in cooperation with <a href="https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/">Callaghan Innovation</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It has received a Royal Society Award nomination, and New Zealand’s second largest electricity distribution company, <a href="http://www.powerco.co.nz/">Powerco</a>, will be the first to test Emrod technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company was founded by serial tech entrepreneur Greg Kushnir, who was determined to find a technology that can reduce power distribution costs, avoid outages and support renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;“We have an abundance of clean hydro, solar, and wind energy available around the world but there are costly challenges that come with delivering that energy using traditional methods, for example, offshore wind farms or the Cook Strait here in New Zealand requiring underwater cables which are expensive to install and maintain,” said Mr Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><span>“I wanted to come up with a solution to move all that clean energy around from where it’s abundant to where it’s needed in a cost-effective, eco-friendly way.</span></p>
<p><span>“Energy generation and storage methods have progressed tremendously over the last century but energy transmission has remained virtually unchanged since Edison, Siemens, and Westinghouse first introduced electric networks based on copper wires 150 years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span>When Mr Kushnir investigated ways to transmit energy wirelessly over vast distances he was struck by how little has been done in the field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Everyone seems to be fixated on the notion that energy comes to consumers as electricity over copper wires and I knew there had to be a better way,”</span></p>
<p><span>Kushnir approached distinguished NZ scientist Dr Ray Simpkin of Callaghan Innovation who lead a feasibility study and worked on the prototype. Callaghan Innovation backed Emrod with a research and development grant and seconded their lead scientist to work on the game changing prototype.</span></p>
<p><span>By significantly reducing infrastructure costs, Emrod’s technology has the capacity to support remote communities such as in Africa and the Pacific Islands by providing access to cheap, sustainable energy to power schools, hospitals, and economies.</span></p>
<p><span>“The statistics are pretty compelling. We are talking about a potential 50 per cent increase in sustainable energy uptake, up to 85 per cent reduction in outages and up to 65 per cent reduction in electricity infrastructure costs due to the Emrod solution,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><b>Powering our local communities</b></p>
<p><span>The company has achieved strong interest from electricity distributors with </span><a href="https://www.powerco.co.nz/"><span>Powerco</span></a><span>, New Zealand’s second-largest distributor deciding to invest in a proof of concept of the technology.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re committed to innovation, and finding new ways to deliver power safely and efficiently to our customers”, says Powerco’s Network Transformation Manager Nicolas Vessiot.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re interested to see whether Emrod’s technology can complement the established ways we deliver power. We envisage using this to deliver electricity in remote places, or across areas with challenging terrain.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s also potential to use it to keep the lights on for our customers when we’re doing maintenance on our existing infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span>Emrod will deliver the</span><span> next prototype to Powerco in October </span><span>and will spend two to three months carrying out lab testing and training Powerco personnel before moving to a field trial.</span></p>
<p><span>“The system we are currently building for Powerco will transmit only a few kilowatts but we can use the exact same technology to transmit 100 times more power over much longer distances. Wireless systems using Emrod technology can transmit any amount of power current wired solutions transmit,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><b>Safety is Paramount</b></p>
<p><span>Safety of the prototype is also front of mind for Emrod, who is using a non-ionizing Industrial, Scientific and Medical frequency (ISM) band to transmit power.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>DebConf20 was due to take place in Haifa, Israel this year (<a href="https://debian.community/debconf20-palestine-messages-censored-debian-project/">a separate controversy about Debian censoring Palestine</a>) but it was moved online due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Therefore, what happens to all the sponsorship money collected in 2020?  Let's look at how Debian parks money in Switzerland.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Debian paid somebody to work on DebConf fundraising <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/alums/">as an Outreachy</a>, generating a lot of gossip that is unfair to the woman concerned.  Naturally, as in any business, fundraising salaries and other costs of acquiring sponsors are the first things that will be deducted from the budget.  We share the view of those who feel she was underpaid: the woman is a highly experienced event organizer.  Debian paid a total of $6,000 for her services, $2,000 per month.  $500 was deducted by Outreachy administrator, Sage Sharp.  This is also controversial, as Sage Sharp does the same work that Debian's GSoC Administrators do, Sage Sharp receives a cut of the money but the Debian GSoC Administrators don't receive anything.  If the woman was employed at an event management company in Israel, she would have received more than $6,000 <em>every</em> month, overtime pay, illness and accident insurance, pension, maternity rights and a performance bonus.  Many non-profit organizations give their fundraising staff at least 10% of all revenues as salary and bonus.  With her experience, the woman in question would easily get that salary package in any other industry.</p>

<p>After deducting the $5,500 Outreachy salary and $500 Sage Sharp fees, what does Debian do with the rest of the money <a href="https://debconf20.debconf.org/sponsors/">from these sponsors</a>?  As we are online in 2020, there are no venue expenses, no travel and accommodation expenses.  We estimate that DebConf has received over $100,000 from these companies and nobody knows where it will go.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sponsor donations</td><td>$100,000</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td>DebConf20 online surplus</td><td>$94,000</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<em>(Not actual figures, estimated from previous DebConfs)</em>

<p>Will this money be used to pay all the volunteers for the next DebConfs?  Or will it be used for other Debian purposes?</p>

<p>Let's have a look at DebConf13 to find the answer.</p>

<img width="40%" alt="Debian hiding money Switzerland" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-logo.png">
<p>DebConf13 organizers had organized the venue and catering contracts separately.  Neither the venue hire or catering contract included provision for washing the dishes.  At the last minute, DebConf organizers had to reach out to local labor-hire companies to find temporary workers and <a href="https://debian.community/assets/2013-07-08-urgent-dishwashing-proposal.pdf">they received a proposal for the work</a>.  Nonetheless, they didn't want to pay people.  As usual, various people suggested they should try to conscript volunteers to do this tedious work:</p>

<blockquote><em>
Subject: Re: [Debconf-team] Urgent: Dishwashing &amp; Cleaning<br>

From: Tiago Bortoletto Vaz &lt;tiago@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debconf-team@lists.debconf.org<p>

On Mon, Jul 08, 2013 at 07:57:07PM +0200, Holger Levsen wrote:<br>
&gt; seriously, buy two dishwashing machines (max 1000€ total) and let them be<br>
&gt; filled by volunteers... 5k for dishwashing is like 3% of our total budget.<br>

I'd join a team to coordinate volunteers on this.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Volunteers don't come to DebConf to wash dishes, they want to relax after dinner, meet people, attend any evening seminars and learn new things.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="debian women, diversity, washing dishes, debconf, outreachy, intern, woman" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-women-washing-dishes.jpg">
<p>Nonetheless, organizers proceeded to seek volunteers for this task.  We notice that female participation in dishwashing was close to thirty percent, much higher than the <a href="https://debian.community/laura-arjona-reina-carnival-mafia-murders/">two percent rate of female participation in development</a>.  Is that a win for diversity?</p>

<p>While discussion about expenditures and volunteers took place on the public <em>debconf-team</em> list, discussions about profit from fundraising were kept on <em>debian-private</em> (<a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">leaked elsewhere</a>).  Local volunteers, who do most of the work in each DebConf destination, were subscribed to <em>debconf-team</em> but they never have access to <em>debian-private</em> so they didn't see the following email:</p>

<blockquote><em>Subject: Call for ideas -- useful ways of spending Debian money<br>
Date: Tue, 1 Oct 2013 21:46:17 +0200<br>
From: Lucas Nussbaum &lt;leader@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debian-private@lists.debian.org<br>
CC: auditor@debian.org, philipp@hug.cx<p>

[ TL;DR: <b>ETOO_MUCH_MONEY</b> -- need ideas to flush queue ]</p><p>

Hi,</p><p>

Thanks to the fantastic work of the DebConf13 sponsorship (fundraising)<br>
team, DebConf13 generated a surplus. The current estimate of it is <b>CHF 38k</b> (that's <b>USD 42k</b>, or <b>EUR 31k</b>). That's excellent news.</p><p>

The not-so-excellent news is that it means that the debconf13<br>
association will have to pay income taxes for it. (no estimate yet;<br>
Philipp Hug (DC13 and debian.ch treasurer) will get in touch with a tax<br>
expert).</p><p>

Even if Switzerland has been very welcoming towards Debian, it would not<br>
be a bad idea to try to avoid paying too much taxes. A good way to do<br>
that is to spend some of the surplus (in ways useful to Debian, of<br>
course).</p><p>

Could you start thinking of useful ways to spend some money? servers?<br>
porter boxes? buildds? sprints? Of course, it would need to be spent before<br>
the end of 2013. There are no known restrictions on what we can buy or<br>
where we can ship. What we end up buying will of course be made public<br>
as usual. To move forward, please reply to this mail, providing an<br>
estimate and a justification. Or mail leader@ + auditor@ if you prefer.</p><p>


Somehow related: we are participating in GNOME's Outreach Program for<br>
Women, winter edition[1].</p><p>

As already stated in April[2], I wouldn't favor a situation where Debian<br>
funds are used to pay OPW participation on a regular basis. However, as<br>
an experiment, it makes sense to help that happen for the first time (it<br>
didn't happen in the summer edition).</p><p>

So, if the fundraising effort currently being set up fails to raise<br>
enough money for one stipend, but still raises a significant amount of<br>
money, I will authorize the use of Debian money for the difference<br>
(likely for at most $2900 -- that's half the stipend, so the other half<br>
needs to come from fundraising).</p><p>

[2] https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/04/msg00108.html</p><p>


Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: Because I'm not sure yet how cautious we need to be about the DC13<br>
   surplus situation. Better safe than sorry. We can restart the<br>
   discussion on a public list when/if things are cleared.<br>
 Thanks,</p><p>

Lucas</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Let us amend that final answer:</p>

<blockquote><em>Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: because we didn't mention this money in the thread about washing dishes<br>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Despite Nussbaum's intention to spend the money, it remains in a Swiss bank account with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostFinance">PostFinance</a>.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="Miriam Ballhausen, Bird &amp; Bird, Women in Business Law Awards 2020 Finalist" src="https://debian.community/assets/twobirds-bird-bird-miriam-ballhausen-women-business-law-award-finalist-2020.jpg">
<p>Where does all the money go?  Well, we know that some of it goes to lawyers.  After a volunteer's father died, Debian was the only organization to send him insults through a lawyer.  We've been told Miriam Ballhausen at Bird &amp; Bird charges EUR 300 per hour for her services, which now includes writing emails and letters on behalf of the Debian project.  The Debian Project doesn't exist as a legal entity, Ballhausen has so far refused to reveal who is actually instructing her.</p>

<p>If that rate is correct, the EUR 31,000 profit from DebConf13 would pay for 100 hours or two weeks of full-time lawyer work.  We doubt that we will see Frau Ballhausen assisting with the dishes.</p>

<p>We would have thought that the legal profession may have some minimum standards, expecting lawyers to respect volunteers at a time of grief and expecting them to be able to identify who they work for.  Not in Germany.  Ballhausen's antics with Debian have seen her <a href="https://awards.womeninbusinesslaw.com/Europe-shortlist?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wibl-eu&amp;utm_content=twittershare#Rising-stars">nominated for the Women in Business Law Awards 2020</a>.</p>

<img alt="Miriam Ballhausen, insults, harassment, abuse, volunteer, GDPR" src="https://debian.community/assets/bird-bird-miriam-ballhausen-gdpr-abuse-debian.png">

<p>The next DebConf for 2021 was supposed to go to Prishtina, Kosovo.  It has been suggested it will be pushed back one year to 2022 but given the pandemic situation, that is not a definite decision.  There are currently no Debian Developers in Kosovo who have access to the financial information in <em>debian-private</em>, we hope that Debian will be as generous in paying the Kosovo local team as they have been with lawyers but we are doubtful.</p>

<p>I’ve heard ham radio is dying since as far back as I can remember. It’s one of those common sayings you always hear. Like, “get off my lawn,” and “kids these days.” But is it true? Is there any evidence to support this? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<h2>Ham radio licensees are increasing</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png" alt="" width="733" height="447" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png 900w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-300x183.png 300w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-768x469.png 768w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-850x519.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></figure>



<p>Data from the ARRL shows that ham radio licensees are increasing. When you look at the chart above, you see two significant markers that are likely driving this growth. </p>



<ul><li>The removal of the code requirement by the FCC.</li><li>The economic collapse of 2008.</li></ul>



<p>The Morse code requirement was always an intimidating part of obtaining your General FCC license. Learning Morse code is like learning a second language. It takes time and effort to learn, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it doesn’t change that it scared many people away from the hobby. When the FCC removed this requirement in 2007, I believe it opened the door for many who spent years on the fence. Then you have the economic downturn of 2008. What does that have to do with ham radio? A lot.</p>



<p>After the economic downturn, the United States watched as survivalism, now commonly calling “prepping,” entered mainstream culture. People were worried as the country was involved in multiple wars and our economy was on the brink of collapse. Citizens stocked up on food storage, water, firearms, and…<em>communications equipment</em>. As our country spiraled into more turmoil ham radio licenses steadily increased to more than 750,000 by the end of 2019. </p>



<h2>Is ham radio a hobby or a public service?</h2>



<p><strong>The debate between ham radio being a public service or just a hobby is a common argument</strong>. The reason we exist is to ultimately have a trained citizenry that can response to natural disasters. This will always be a thread in our hobby, but this thread is merging more and more with digital functions, including the Internet. That’s where some people get grumpy.</p>



<h3>FT8/JS8Call</h3>



<p><a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FT8/JS8Call</a> has drew the ire from older operators who don’t see it as “real ham radio.” Though the technology could have huge implications for passing traffic when conditions are rough in remote parts of the world.</p>



<h3>Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)</h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Mobile Radio</a> has exploded in growth in the past decade. Many amateur radio operators use <a href="http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet-connected hotspots</a> to operate from their shack without tying up local repeaters. These Internet-connected repeaters hold value, the biggest is the ability to have two different time slots carrying voice traffic simultaneously on one repeater, whether they have an Internet connection or not. DMR doesn’t need to have an Internet backbone to be a game-changer for emergency communications.</p>



<p>Ham radio will always be a hobby where those engaged are practicing to help if the need ever arises, whether they participate in public service events with local clubs or not. And younger operators are redefining how it’s done with new digital technologies — and that’s a great thing!</p>



<h2>Millennials are not killing ham radio… they’re the future</h2>



<p>Some ham radio operators believe younger hams are “killing” the hobby. These often dismissive and vile opinions are not great for the future of amateur radio. Integrating new technology like VOIP and microcomputers into amateur radio is what it’s all about—using the resources available to communicate and exchange information with others around the world. Who cares how we get it done?</p>



<h3>Getting young kids involved in ham radio</h3>



<p>We must get children interested in the hobby. Today, kids aren’t impressed with the ability to talk around with the world on 100 watts and a wire. They’re just not. How do we get young people interested in the digital age where they can communicate anywhere in the world with a tap of a button? The ARRL hasn’t done a great job in attracting young people — but there are things we can do!</p>



<h3>Capitalize on the next generation of space exploration</h3>



<p>The United States is embarking on the next generation of space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are making space and engineering cool again, and ham radio could easily ride that wave. Focus on targeting kids interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and educate them on AMSAT and the potential to communicate with the International Space Station (ISS). Using space exploration as a drive for getting a ham license would be a fantastic entry point for space geeks everywhere.</p>



<h3>Use remote HF and SWL stations to spark interest</h3>



<p>For young ham radio operators who already have their license, look no further than <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remote Ham Radio</a> as a shining example of how to get kids interested in upgrading their license. <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They offer a program where kids can win free time</a> using world-class remote DX contest stations. The young hams have to meet the following criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Be 25 years old or younger</li><li>Hold a General class or higher license</li><li>Be a member of the ARRL</li><li>Have an interest or experience in DXing/Contesting</li><li>Tell us why RHR would be a good fit for you</li></ul>



<p>Kudos to Remote Ham Radio for offering this program to young hams!</p>



<h3>POTA/SOTA combines ham radio and outdoor adventure</h3>



<p>Living in Colorado, I grew fond of Summits On The Air (SOTA) rather quickly. I mean, it’s cool. You can exercise while playing ham radio all at the same time. We should be focusing on how we can use these outdoor portable operations to attract young hams who love the outdoors. For the extreme outdoor enthusiasts, it would be wise to focus on the usefulness of being able to communicate from the wilderness where cell phone signals are non-existent.</p>



<p><strong>Ham radio has evolved</strong>, albeit slowly compared to other technology sectors. That evolution is inevitable. We can’t fight it. We shouldn’t fight it. We need to find ways to encourage new exploration of communication methodology. That all starts with younger ham radio operators bringing new ideas and skills to our hobby.</p>



<p>Let’s not fight it. Let’s embrace it.</p>

<p>Two months ago, I self-published a book called <a href="https://zerotosoldbook.com/">Zero to Sold: How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1277573850297966592">released it on Twitter</a>. Within twenty-four hours, I sold 350 copies. Within another twenty-four hours, the book was #1 on Product Hunt and already a category bestseller on Amazon. After a week, 1000 copies had been sold, with sales still going strong and the book ranking as #1 New Release in the “Startups” and “Small Business” Amazon categories. How did this happen?</p>

<h2>The Void</h2>



<p>It started with a blog post that I never published. In 2018, I was so fully immersed in working on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/from-founding-to-exit-in-two-years-the-feedbackpanda-story/">FeedbackPanda, a teacher productivity SaaS</a> that I co-founded with my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpsonDaniK">Danielle</a>, that I didn’t have much time or energy to write. Every day was filled with customer conversations and product work, with barely any space to reflect on what we had learned. I used the few moments of clarity to jot down notes in a text document, hoping that I’d find some time to polish them into an article. But it never got anywhere near being ready to be published.</p>



<p>And then, we <a href="https://www.sureswiftcapital.com/blog/bootstrapped-saas-founders-sell-business/">chose to sell the business</a>. After a few months of due diligence and transitioning the business over to the new owners, I finally had all the time I ever wanted. My life turned from running a business at full speed into idling my thumbs. When you build an exceptionally sellable company, you focus on making yourself replaceable. Little did I know that once I was replaced, I didn’t have a purpose anymore. So I threw myself right into my next project: documenting what we did and sharing what we had learned. Leading up to building FeedbackPanda, I had consumed a lot of content that successful founders had shared with the community. I wanted to do the exact same thing now: give back to other bootstrapped founders and indie hackers.</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t yet decided on a medium through which I would share my insights, I started collecting content ideas by taking notes whenever I thought of a particular theme. I knew that I would want to release articles on many subjects on a platform, so I planned them out as blog posts from the start. I started working on this list in August of 2019.</p>



<p>Initially, all those ideas revolved around coping with stress and anxiety on some level. That had been the emotional state in which I had found myself in towards the end of running FeedbackPanda. The first series of blog posts I wanted to write was called <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/emotional-journey/">The Emotional Journey of a Bootstrapped Founder</a>.</p>



<p>In a Notion document, I created a table of all my blog post title ideas. Quickly, after I had exhausted all my anxiety-related topics, I pivoted into other areas of running a SaaS business as well. Within a couple days, I had aggregated somewhere between forty and fifty blog post ideas. At that point, I understood for the first time that this might be my next big project.</p>

<p>Whenever I felt like it, I would click on each blog post title idea and jot down a few thoughts on what I’d write about in the article. I would add links to interesting essays, research papers, even photos of little sketches I made on paper.</p>

<p>Several blog posts took shape over the weeks, and I decided to turn this project into reality. I polished those articles following <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro">Julian Shapiro’s recommendations</a>. I ended up with ten or so pieces to start the blog with.</p>



<h2>The Blog</h2>



<p>Here’s an open secret about me: I’m incredibly lazy. If I can avoid tedious work, I’ll spend a lot of time to make sure I never have to do it again. While this really helped us build a well-documented and highly automated business, it is a drawback for a content creator. Writing well and regularly takes a lot of discipline. I knew that I needed some structure in place to hold myself accountable beyond the articles I had already written.</p>



<p>To make sure that this project wouldn’t just evaporate, I decided to commit to building a blog by publishing one article every week, for at least two years. But how could I force myself to write every week? Looking at the content that I regularly consume, I figured that releasing a newsletter every week would keep me accountable for writing something meaningful regularly.</p>



<p>When I built The Bootstrapped Founder blog, I immediately set it up to host the Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter. I released the first episode of that within days of making the blog public. <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1194647611988480000">I announced the launch on Twitter</a>, and got just a few likes. Not surprising.  I had a fledgling audience of maybe 500 followers on Twitter, and I made sure to share my content as much as I could within those first few weeks, including <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/the-bootstrapped-founder/launched-the-bootstrapped-founder-blog--LtZG5nAqrB8ucRj5F-v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the IndieHackers product page</a> I had created for the blog.</p>

<p>My Twitter strategy was simple: just be myself. I love reading the stories of other founders, no matter if they are succeeding or struggling. Amplifying those voices, retweeting their milestones, and commenting when they asked for help was something I consciously did every day. Within weeks, my audience grew, apparently both intrigued by my blog posts, levels of activity, and engagement with the community.</p>



<p>That gave me the fuel to write more and more. There were weeks where I’d work on three to five blog posts at the same time, driven by the discussions I had on Twitter. More and more topics and themes emerged through this work. The list of forty blog post title ideas turned into a list of hundreds of topics, all in different stages of being worked on.</p>



<p>Throughout all of this, people started asking to consume my content on another medium: they wondered if I would ever start a podcast. As a German who learned speaking English mostly from watching Al Bundy on Married with Children and raid-leading large groups of gamers in World of Warcraft back in 2008, I hesitated to put myself out there in an audio-only format. But I quickly understood that this would result in many exciting opportunities: I could diversify my userbase to include those who had no time to read, those who didn’t like reading, it would be another channel to market whatever I would end up selling in the future, and it would allow my readers to put a voice to the thoughts. I would just read the article aloud as the first half of each show. Then, I could add some unscripted content to each episode to make it attractive for those who already read what I had written. Since I wanted the material between the podcast and the blog to be synchronized, I spent a few weeks recording a show or two every day to catch up.</p>



<h2>The Guide</h2>



<p>While I was on this journey through my back catalog, I noticed a fascinating thing. All those blog posts titles I had written when random thoughts had occurred to me seemed to fit into a structure. A larger entity started to take shape. After a few hours of shuffling titles around in a Notion document, I had found that I was well on my way to write a fully-fledged guide on bootstrapping. Without knowing or intending for it to happen, here it was, everything I knew about the journey from idea to acquisition.</p>



<p>I had written maybe 30% of the actual articles I wanted to have in that guide. I decided to go at it for the rest of them the only way I know as a software engineer and bootstrapper: sketch out a foundation and then iterate slowly and deliberately. For the guide (that at that point was called “The Bootstrapped Founder Guide to Bootstrapping,”) that meant that it would start with a compendium. I outlined it by sorting the blog posts I had already written into a structure and putting only headlines in the gaps. Then, over a few days, I filled out those gaps with two to three paragraphs each. I condensed the most important points I would want to make in those yet-to-be-written articles into a few sentences.</p>



<p>And then, I <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1222896794893336578">immediately released the compendium</a> on the 30th of January of 2020, two months after I had started writing on the blog. A few days prior, a Twitter follower had suggested the name “From Zero to Sold,” which I really liked. I shortened it to “Zero to Sold,” and featured the compendium prominently on my website and social media profiles.</p>

<p>From there on, I continued to write an article every week, shared it with my growing newsletter audience, read it on the podcast, and integrated it into the compendium. When I had written around half of the number of articles I wanted to write, someone on Twitter asked me if they could get the compendium as a PDF. They said they’d even pay $10 for it. That really made me think. And when I think, I tweet. Lots of people replied that they’d love to see the compendium fleshed out as a full book.</p>



<p>Suppose you’ve looked into Zero to Sold or have checked out the compendium. In that case, you will know that I recommend an Audience-Problem-Solution-Product approach. Start with a group of people you want to help, find their critical problems, envision a solution that fits their workflow, and build a product in the medium they wish to use. And here was a group of founders and indie hackers (an audience I love), telling me that they need guidance on building their business (a critical problem commonly shared), asking for a full-journey guide (a clear solution to the problem), as a book (as a medium of product consumption). This could not be more validated if I wanted to.</p>



<p>So I sat down to write the rest of the book.</p>



<h2>The Manuscript</h2>



<p>Let me share a few details on how that exactly happened. The first few blog posts were written in Notion, which really didn’t lend itself to long-form writing. I quickly migrated those texts over into individual markdown files, which I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/why-you-should-try-graphql/">writeup about GraphQL itself head on over here</a>. In this piece, we’ll take a look at some of the many handy GraphQL tools that make using it even more worthwhile. Bear in mind there’s quite a few of them so we’re not going to get through the lot of them in one go.</p>
<h2>Prisma</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, working with GraphQL will require you to set up a database. Well, there’s also BaaS so you can outsource it, but what if you don’t want to? This is where Prisma comes in, it’s a clever middle ground between doing it yourself and outsourcing.
<strong>Prisma is an ORM library</strong> that lets you interact with the database from the server in the language you choose. So if you want to write to your MySQL database you don’t have to do it in SQL, Prima lets you do it in Python, JavaScript or some other language you prefer. </p>
<p>You might think: <em>“Yeah, but that’s just what a regular ORM library does”</em>. True, but Prisma comes with a few added functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>database agnostic: Prisma currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and AWS Aurora, with more to come soon,</li>
<li>supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Flow, and Go,</li>
<li>provides premade basic CRUD queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relay</h2>
<p><strong>Relay is a JavaScript framework</strong> created by Facebook for fetching and managing GraphQL data. Relay is supposed to be the go-to tool for GraphQL users with a focus on validating and optimizing your code. Another focal point is being a <strong>bridge between GraphQL and React</strong>. Relay lets you set up your data requirements using GraphQL and then it will handle the fetching, collecting queries into network requests to get you exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>Relay is composed of three main loosely coupled modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relay Compiler: a GraphQL compiler that analyzes, validates, and optimizes GraphQL in your code.</li>
<li>Relay Runtime: a full-featured GraphQL runtime for building higher level client APIs</li>
<li>Relay/React: a product API that integrates Relay Runtime with React</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apollo</h2>
<p><strong>The APOLLO platform</strong> is an implementation of GraphQL that transfers data from the server to your UI. <strong>Apollo-client</strong> is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that lets you manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. The aim is to enable you to build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. <strong>Apollo-server</strong> is a quick way for building an API for GraphQL using data from any source by using a spec-compliant server that can be queried from any GraphQL client, including the Apollo-client. </p>
<p>Let’s look at the Apollo-client features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a declarative approach to data fetching, all the logic for retrieving data, tracking, loading and uploading it to the UI is contained in a single query,</li>
<li>designed for modern React, the Apollo client takes advantage of the latest React features such as hooks,</li>
<li>adaptable, can be dropped into any JavaScript app seamlessly,</li>
<li>universally compatible, can be used with any GraphQL API.</li>
</ul>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>All networking applications essentially boil down to stringing together
multiple asynchronous calls in the <em>right</em> way.
Traditionally for programs written in C this would be done through
registering callbacks where the callee either handles the event itself
or dispatches through a state machine.
In such implementations however reasoning about memory safety
can be treacherous, with it sometimes requiring full-program knowledge.
Futures, or promises, as they are also referred to,
ease in that regard by allowing asynchronous programs
to be written in direct style, keeping the control flow linear.</p>

<p>All things considered, I do think that futures can be a good fit
for C programming under the right circumstances.
I also hope this article can serve to help one understand Rust futures,
by being a separate reference that only touches the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The Rust futures story is especially interesting because it is
fundamentally different from the usual workings of futures
in functional languages or, say, JavaScript.
Whereas other implementations are <em>push</em>-based -
meaning you give a function to be pushed to with
the resolved result of the future -
Rust futures are <em>poll</em>-based.
Let us see how this looks in C with the simplification
that we limit ourselves to a single task,
i.e. one top-level future running on one thread.
This is common in embedded programming, and still <em>fairly</em> manageable
without the security guarantees given by Rust.
<a href="https://libuv.org/">libuv</a> is used for the event loop.
No heap allocations will be required - it is all downhill from here
(Get it? Because the stack grows down.) -
other than those imposed by the libuv interface.</p>

<p>The main <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>std::future::Future</code></a> trait
translated into C as a virtual method table becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>{</span> <span>POLL_PENDING</span><span>,</span> <span>POLL_READY</span> <span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>poll</span><span>)(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// For now let's skip this method</span>
	<span>// void (*drop)(struct Future *self, struct Context *ctx);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As an example, let us consider the simplest case:
A future that immediately resolves with the number <code>4</code>,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>self</span><span>;</span>
	<span>self</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>future</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>simpleFuture</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>future</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>poll</span> <span>=</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>,</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// ... and in the event loop</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>simpleFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; POLL_READY</span>
<span>// Here we can now use the result</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>result</span> <span>// =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To <em>attempt</em> to resolve the future, we poll it;
it returns <code>POLL_READY</code> and as such we are done.
And for futures that instead return <code>POLL_PENDING</code> when polled,
we just make sure to poll them again later -
futures are lazy and do not make progress unless actively told to do so.
No one knows better than the future itself when it should
be polled again - <em>awoken</em> -
so the context given to all futures allows them to awake their own task.
With many parallel tasks the additional complexity would make itself apparent here,
but in our case something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uv_loop_t</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>wakeTask</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span> <span>// Finished!</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will suffice.
Polling the future once at startup will then kick off the machinery.</p>

<p>For a libuv timer future, we would want to write something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>TimerStatus</span> <span>{</span> <span>TIMER_NOT_STARTED</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_WAITING</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_FINISHED</span> <span>};</span>

<p>The timer handle is made to hold a reference to the future in
its user data field,
so that the callback knows which future to toggle the status on.
However this requires the future object to be pinned in memory,
moving it would make the reference dangling.
Rust deals with this unsafety using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">Pin construct</a>,
that wraps a pointer type, <code>P</code>,
and only permits operations that cannot move the pointee
(for cases where it may not always be safe to do so, i.e. <code>P: !Unpin</code>)
and ensures its memory remains valid until it gets dropped,
or helps make manually vetted code <em>nonleaky</em>.
In C there is no such thing;
the closest you will get is with a red paragraph buried in the documentation.
This means treading with care,
allocating storage for the main future once and never copying it, and
only referring to futures with pointers to their static place in memory.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to get by with just one global <code>uv_timer_t</code>
by recognizing that whenever the main future is awoken either:
(I) A timer, necessarily the one with smallest timeout, fired;
or (II) All timers need be dropped and reset, since the futures form a tree,
as we will see.</p>

<h2 id="after-you">After you</h2>

<p>Running multiple futures sequentially is just a matter of
constructing a new future that polls each future to completion,
one after the other.
The poll method of the outer future will have to return <code>POLL_PENDING</code>
after each intermediate step,
before continuing where it left off - like a coroutine.
Rust turns each future into a state machine,
and doing the same in C means playing the part of the Rust compiler.
An adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a>,
as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">described by Simon Tatham</a>,
can help cut down on the boilerplate.
The idea is that with a <code>switch</code> statement enveloping the whole function-body,
you can yield by creating a unique label using the <code>__LINE__</code> macro
where execution will begin upon reentry,
setting the switch-expression as such, and returning.
The following macros do just that</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>Coroutine</span><span>;</span>

<span>#define COR_START(s) switch (*(s)) { case 0:;
#define COR_YIELD(s, r) do {*(s) = __LINE__; return (r); case __LINE__:;} while(0)
#define COR_END }
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a pointer to the coroutine state.
Great care has to be taken because when returning all locals are invalidated -
if only there was a language that could statically check for such mistakes.
Awaiting then becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#define AWAIT(s, ctx, fut) while ((fut)-&gt;poll((fut), (ctx)) == POLL_PENDING) \
	COR_YIELD((s), POLL_PENDING)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>that is, yielding until the given future is resolved.</p>

<p>To illustrate, here is a future that prints four times to standard output,
first thrice at one second intervals, and then again after two more seconds:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TestFuture</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Note that the local <code>i</code> had to be spilled to the future struct
in order to persist across yield points,
and that unions are used to show what variables are active at each step,
and squeeze out that last driblet of performance even in the face of
uncompromising undefined behaviour threats from all directions.</p>

<h2 id="off-to-the-races">Off to the races</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, multiple futures can be made to run in parallel
using a future combinator whose poll method polls all of its children
and either waits for all to complete - <em>joins</em> them,
or selects the first to become ready.
The latter is a tad more difficult, so let us focus on that.
The reason is that after the first future has resolved,
the rest may still be running, their memory possibly referenced elsewhere.
This is where the <code>drop()</code> method that we have skimmed over comes in.
Dropping a pinned object should relax the constraint
that its memory remains valid.
The drop implementation of <code>TimerFuture</code> above could for example
call <code>uv_timer_stop()</code> so the callback never fires
or overwrite the dangling reference to the future with <code>NULL</code>.
For other types, since their drop implementations are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Selling software to the enterprise is hard, rewarding, and nothing like this movie.</p>

<p>The enterprise SaaS industry is booming. Much has been written about how to scale B2C tech, as consumer technology companies such as Google, Facebook, or Netflix enjoy near-monopolies, employ hordes of people, and command appropriately dominant mindshare. A relative lack of material has been written about building enterprise software, particularly from a product &amp; engineering point of view.</p>

<p>In this post series we’ll describe techniques on building an easily sellable SaaS product. To set the stage, we’ll define “enterprise buyers” as companies that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employ 500+ people</li>
  <li>Are prepared to pay around $100,000 or (much) more for strategic products</li>
  <li>Regularly make long-term, multi-year software buying commitments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enterprise-sales-is-like-marriage">Enterprise Sales is Like Marriage</h2>

<p>SaaS covers a wide spectrum of businesses: from enterprise products that cost tens of millions of dollars over multiple years, to freemium products that start at $10/month. The strategies that help you sell one will not (typically) work for the other. The process of settling on the former product is like getting married: months to years building the relationship, multiple suitors, and meetings with the parents, all with the intention of making a decades long commitment. Buying a $150/year utility SaaS, by comparison, is like a Tinder date that ends with getting busy in the back of a Prius.</p>

<p>Once you see the similarities between enterprise buying and marriage, many dimensions of how to sell high-value SaaS become more clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Like a marriage, it’s important to have integrity. Don’t oversell – put your best foot forward (brush your teeth before the first date!) but have integrity in how you sell yourself (don’t lie about your job, your height, or where you went to school).</li>
  <li>You need to offer something differentiated. Nobody wants to settle – you need to be the best catch in at least one, and preferably multiple important dimensions.</li>
  <li>There are a lot of stakeholders. “Meeting the parents” is a key step in serious dating; meeting your buyer’s Procurement and Infosec teams can be a (disturbingly) similar experience.</li>
  <li>You need to be the right partners for each other. Enterprise sales relies upon product/<strong>customer</strong> fit – you should solve a need for your buyer, and you should be able to actually deliver. A common example: over-selling to a Fortune 500 company as a 40-person company, when you don’t have the stability, maturity, or headcount to deliver the service that they expect. Maybe you all are just meeting at the wrong moment in your lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I began my career I didn’t understand this dynamic at all. I imagined that enterprise sales was like trying to meet someone at a bar: look as hot as possible, go to a few steak dinners, dance poorly and hope for the best. Superficial stuff. In reality, building a product that can sell to big-company buyers requires scoring well across a broad constellation of factors: the equivalents of getting a good education, having a steady job, and demonstrating that you know how to clean your apartment. Enterprise buyers expect to be courted, and as a builder you have the tools to put your best foot forward.</p>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-an-enterprise-sale">The Anatomy of an Enterprise Sale</h2>

<p>These posts on how to sell to the enterprise are rooted in the core drivers that impact huge software purchases. Understanding these drivers as a product builder can help you navigate the arcane “dating” process behind closing your first (or next) enterprise logo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spending millions of dollars on a software solution is necessarily a complex process due to the sheer amount of “stuff” going on at a large company.</li>
  <li>Enterprise software deployments have a complex web of stakeholders. The buyer of enterprise software is often different from the user, as software is (often) bought by executives but used by their teams. Decisions on which vendors to use can take on a political dimension, as they can make or break careers.</li>
  <li>Change is <em>extremely</em> expensive to enterprise buyers because they’re massive and built for momentum over agility. Like a battleship, they can carry a lot of people very far but are a pain to turn. Enterprise companies value stability, and they want to commit upfront to a long-term partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this series, we’ll discuss strategies for building a product that will sell to the enterprise, and that will keep them happy for years. Following posts will break down strategies we’ve found helpful, and hopefully provide some ideas as you develop your own products.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Building a product that can sell to the enterprise is difficult but rewarding.</li>
  <li>Enterprise sales is like dating with intent to marry, with many of the same dynamics.</li>
  <li>Enterprise buyers’ decision-making is influenced by several important drivers: the complexity of enterprise businesses, complicated webs of stakeholders, and the need to plan on long time horizons.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

</div><h3>Getting Air Traffic Data

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

<section>
    
    <small>Published on 28. August 2020</small>
    <p>You can find a lot of articles about how to prevent deadlocks in Go, but most of them focus on concurrency patterns and synchronization tools like mutexes. While it is important to know some techniques to prevent them, a trap you can stumble across more easily without noticing, are database transaction deadlocks.</p><p>A transaction deadlock can occur when you start one or more transactions and run queries outside of transactions while they are still active. If you run too many transactions and queries at the same time, you might run out of database connections in the connection pool. Here is a simple example of that:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// We will ignore errors for this example,
// you should always check them of course.

tx, _ := db.Begin()
tx.Exec(`INSERT INTO "foo" ("a", "b") VALUES (4, 2)`)

// ...

db.Query(`SELECT * FROM "foo" WHERE "a" = $1 AND "b" = $2`, 4, 2)

// DEADLOCK

tx.Commit()</code></pre><p>In this example, we create a new transaction and insert something to the database. Later on, we try to query the same result from the database. That the inserted row has not been committed yet, is not the actual issue, as you would receive no result in that case. The real issue here is that if you run this code concurrently, you might run out of connections. How many connections are opened to the database can be configured. As soon as your code reaches the <code>db.Query</code> the last connection might be occupied by the transaction and therefore blocks until a connection is available, which might never happen.</p><p>So how do you fix this? First of all, all queries should be run either outside or inside a transaction for a specific part of your code. Even if you run a transaction block and a non-transaction block concurrently, the non-transaction block will not be blocked by the transaction forever (but the non-transaction block might need to wait for the other part to finish). Additionally, you can use a linter or another tool to make sure all queries are run completely inside or outside of transactions.</p><p>I usually write integration tests against the database. If you do the same, you can configure the connection pool size to make sure the tests will only use a single connection. That way the tests will run into a deadlock should you have forgotten to use a transaction somewhere. You can easily configure that inside the <code>TestMain</code> function for a package.</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	db.SetMaxOpenConns(1) // db is the *sql.DB created somewhere
}</code></pre><p>I hope this helps you to prevent some nasty deadlock bugs. I found quite a few in a larger code base by limiting the connection pool. In production, you should use multiple connections to speed up things of course.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, this series is going to come off as if I dislike WebAssembly. I love WebAssembly! I wrote a <a href="http://troubles.md/why-wasm/">whole article about how great it is</a>! In fact, I love it so much that I want it to be the best that it can be, and this series is me working through my complaints with the design in the hope that some or all of these issues can be addressed soon, while the ink is still somewhat wet on the specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure you’re all familiar with WebAssembly by now. It’s seeing use everywhere, from plugins to blockchain smart contracts to, of course, the web. If you go to the Wikipedia article for WebAssembly right now, you’ll get a great overview of the technology, except for one thing: the “Design” section states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly code is intended to be run on a portable abstract structured stack machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<h2 id="stack-machines-vs-register-machines">Stack machines vs register machines</h2>
<p>The difference between a stack and a register machine is essentially this: a stack machine pops values from and pushed values onto a stack, so for example a <code>+</code> operation will pop the last two values off of the stack, add them together, and then push the result back onto the stack. A register machine has some number of places where values can be stored, and operations reads and writes to those registers. So <code>+</code> will take 3 arguments, 2 that represent the registers to read the operands from and 1 that represents the register to write the result to<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The problem with registers is that there is no liveness analysis. If you have some code like so:</p>
<pre><code>%0 = 1
%1 = 2
%2 = add %0, %1
...
</code></pre><p>Are <code>%0</code> and <code>%1</code> used after the addition? Without lookahead, you have no way of knowing. Even in SSA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> register machines like LLVM IR (where each register is written to exactly once) the liveness of each register must be continuously recalculated. This means that you have overhead associated with compilation - knowing the liveness of variables is extremely important for generating efficient assembly, but instead of the liveness being calculated when creating the IR and stored as a part of it you have to recalculate this data every time.</p>
<p>If the IR is entirely in-memory this isn’t so bad, especially if your code is in SSA form, but it means that you have to do extra work for the same quality of code and it means that a streaming compiler (like FireFox’s Wasm baseline compiler) is unable to produce good code.</p>
<p>You can, of course, add liveness analysis metadata to the machine, but that liveness analysis is only useful if your code is in SSA form - if it’s not SSA form then the liveness is <em>extremely</em> coarse-grained.</p>
<p>Well, that’s where WebAssembly comes in. See, WebAssembly has these things called locals. Locals are mutable variables that live for the lifetime of a function. Since WebAssembly blocks can’t take arguments, they’re the only way for blocks to receive data from outside. This includes stuff like loop counters, the classic example for SSA-defeating mutable variables, but it also includes regular blocks. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>; Can't read the result of the add above</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You have to do this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local.set</span> <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is a problem. Usually a stack machine can be trivially converted to SSA form with liveness analysis - an item on the stack is dead when it is used as the argument to an operator - no ifs, no buts. Even a <code>pick</code> operator<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> can be thought of in these terms as long as the argument to <code>pick</code> is a compile-time constant, although generally the SSA conversion of a stack machine that includes a <code>pick</code> instruction would be implemented using refcounting - meaning that reading a variable doesn’t involve creating an unnecessary new one. However, locals are a problem. They’re mutable, so you can’t trivially convert them to SSA, and they always live for the lifetime of the function.</p>
<p>This poses a problem for optimisation. SSA form is one of the most powerful optimisation tools. The fact that locals are mutable defeats that, and the fact that they’re global to the function defeats liveness analysis. For an example of why this is an issue, say you’re trying to compile WebAssembly into some native architecture. You’ll compile your code into one that uses some number of arguments in registers, but now unless you do your own liveness analysis on that function those registers are permanently marked “in use” by those arguments. Without extra analysis you don’t know when the last usage of that argument is, and so you can’t ever reuse the register used by that argument for something else. Even a function that never uses any of its arguments still can’t reuse the space used by those arguments for anything else.</p>
<p>This essentially makes WebAssembly a register machine without liveness analysis, but not only that, it’s a register machine that isn’t even in SSA form - both of the tools at our disposal to do optimisation are unavailable. In a true, optimising compiler we can recreate that information, but WebAssembly was already emitted by a compiler that generated that information once. There’s no technical reason why we should have to do that work again, it’s just a deficiency in the language. A compiler that has to act on a stream of WebAssembly has less ability to recreate this information and will end up generating significantly worse code for essentially no good reason.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The developers of the WebAssembly spec aren’t dumb. For the most part it’s an extremely well-designed specification. However, they are weighed down by WebAssembly’s legacy. WebAssembly started out not as a bytecode, but more like a simplified binary representation for asm.js. Essentially it was originally designed to be source code, like JavaScript. It would be a more-efficient representation thereof but it still wasn’t a proper virtual machine instruction set. Then, it became a register machine<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and only at the last minute did it switch to stack-based encoding for the operators. At that point, concepts like locals were quite entrenched in the spec. Not only that, but for the most part the WebAssembly specification team were flying blind. No streaming compiler had yet been built, hell, no compiler had yet been built. It wasn’t clear that having locals would be problematic - after all, C gets by just fine using local variables that the compiler constructs the SSA graph for.</p>
<p>It’s only by working on a streaming WebAssembly compiler for integration with <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> that I realised these issues, as well as more issues that I’ll get to in later articles in this series. Before then I considered WebAssembly’s design to be utterly rock-solid, and in fact I still strongly believe that most of the decisions made were the right ones. Although it has problems, it’s incredible how much the WebAssembly working group got right considering it was such relatively unknown territory at the time of the specification’s writing.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-alternative">What’s the alternative?</h2>
<p>So currently locals represent both function arguments and local variables. There is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value/blob/master/proposals/multi-value/Overview.md">a proposal to allow blocks to have arguments and both functions and blocks to return more than one value</a>. With this, it becomes possible to get rid of locals entirely. Loop counters are implemented by having the counter be given as an argument, and then when you jump to the header of the loop you must have the new value of the counter on the stack. This acts like a phi function but is much conceptually simpler. Since it’s impossible to get the address of locals in WebAssembly there’s no need for <code>alloca</code> in any form - unlike in LLVM, you don’t need to have locals at all. The only thing left is to implement function arguments by having the function start with its arguments on the stack and you no longer need locals at all.</p>
<p>This massively reduces the complexity of the WebAssembly specification and compilers for it without reducing the expressivity, and allows the compilers generating the WebAssembly to encode more of their knowledge about the original source into the WebAssembly itself. Although optimising compilers will probably not generate better code from this, they will become much simpler and easier to maintain, and streaming compilers will become significantly simpler and produce significantly better code.</p>
<p>Finally, not only is a stack machine like this automatically in SSA form, but it’s automatically in <em>strict</em> SSA form. This means that it is statically impossible to access undefined variables. In WebAssembly as it exists now, you have to zero locals when entering a function unless you can statically prove that the local is always set before it is accessed. Again, the compilers almost always have this information, and removing locals makes accessing undefined memory statically impossible.</p>
<p>Join me next time where I tackle WebAssembly’s problematic control flow.</p>

  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3a8e939667e3734b84dff063fff3965fe824553c/d7922/uploads/good-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/2020/08/07/how-to-name">this video</a>, I walked you through our naming process. We usually work in a workshop format to create a long list of potential brand names for our clients. This can be done either remote or onsite. If you’ve missed this it the last time, make sure you watch the video first:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8Hlbp8mp_I?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Once we have the long list of names, how do we make the selection? How do we distinguish between good and bad brand names?</p>

<p>The process is twofold: On the one side, we need too identify good brand names, on the other side we need to exclude all the bad names. So let’s look at the first part: How do you create a good brand name?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-brand-name">What makes a good brand name?</h2>

<p>At Human Deluxe, we follow the teachings of Alexandra Watkins, who created the SMILE &amp; SCRATCH principles: Good names make you smile, bad names leave you scratch your head. Of course, these are Acronyms, so let’s look at how to make yourself SMILE with a good name:</p>

<p>The qualities of a good name:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: A good name will give you a hint of a positive brand experience. It will suggest the rest of the brand for you. Great examples of this are travel company KAYAK or streaming service Pandora: Once you open the streaming box, it would not stop playing – clever, right?</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> A good name resonates with your target audience. Not only do they feel good, but they already know what to expect. Obvious examples of this are domain provider Namecheap, diet drink Slimfast or even good old Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Imagery</strong> A great name is visually evocative. It creates a picture in your head that people will instantly associate with your brand. Even if a name is abstract, it will be able to give your audience a certain association and idea of what it could look like. Think of brands like: Caterpilar or Citibank – these are great examples.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong> Like a good hiker, a great name has strong legs. It lends itself to a theme for extra mileage: A name with great legs can shine through to the whole brand, directing the tonality and vocabulary. Personally, I like how twitter worked that in: A single microblogpost is a Tweet, the logo is a bird, even certain icons would be bird-themed, like the birdhouse Home button or the egg avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong> A good brand name moves people. does not only work in their mind, it touches their heart. This works for both B2C and B2B companies. Business brands don’t have to be boring. In fact, they can swing up to greater heights if they have an emotional impact, distinguishing themselves from their dull competition. Brands that are brave enough to be emotional do connect with humans like no other. Take Yahoo! or Greenpeace for example – it works.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out if your brand is good, your name for these criterias. At best, a good name ticks all of them. At least, your name should check one or two criterias. At any cost, avoid head scratchers names. In our next article, we will explain what these are and how you identify them. Sign up for our newsletter to get this article earlier than everybody else, as well as the free name checker template.</p>

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the public release of <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt"><code>defmt</code></a> ("de format").
<code>defmt</code> stands for "deferred formatting" and it's a highly efficient logging framework.
As we covered in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">our blog post about embedded tooling for the 21st century</a> we hope <code>defmt</code> will serve as the base for features like data visualization and interactive logging front-ends.
In this post we'll cover how to use <code>defmt</code> with <code>probe-rs</code> supported devices and what you can do with <code>defmt</code> today.</p>



<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template">Cargo project template</a> to make the setup easier.
Here are the setup steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <strong>git</strong> version of <code>probe-run</code>, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/probe-run/">a custom Cargo runner that lets you run embedded apps if they were native apps</a>. Be sure to enable the <code>defmt</code> Cargo feature!</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo install <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--features</span> defmt
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Either initialize the project template with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate"><code>cargo-generate</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template/archive/master.zip">fetch a copy</a> and initialize the <code>Cargo.toml</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo generate <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--name</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not using <code>cargo-generate</code> you'll need to manually enter the <code>author</code> and <code>name</code> fields in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [package]
<span>-# authors = ["{{authors}}"]
-# name = "{{project-name}}"
</span><span>+name = "my-app"
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that there are a few TODOs in the template.
You can <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> for the word TODO (<code>rg TODO .cargo .</code>) to find them but we'll walk you through all of them in this blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a chip from <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> and enter it into <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our workshops</a> then replace <code>{{chip}}</code> with <code>nRF52840_xxAA</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
<span>-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
</span><span>+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the compilation target in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 chip you'll want to use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
<span>-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
</span><span>+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Add a HAL as a dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal"><code>nrf52840-hal</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
<span>-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
</span><span>+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in <code>src/lib.rs</code></li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code> // my-app/src/lib.rs
<span>-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
</span><span>+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>You are now all set to <code>cargo-run</code> your first <code>defmt</code>-powered application!
There are some examples in the <code>src/bin</code> directory.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/hello.rs</span>

<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_main</span><span>]</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>use</span> <span>my_app</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>// global logger + panicking-behavior + memory layout</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>cargo run</code>-ning this program produces the classic "Hello, world!" output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rb hello
<span>    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>0
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you are using VS code + Rust-Analyzer, instead, you can open the <code>src/bin/hello.rs</code> file and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/run-rust-on-your-embedded-device-from-vscode/">click the "Run" button as we demonstrated in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the features of the framework.
This post will be a quick overview.
For more details check out <a href="https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/">the <code>defmt</code> book</a>.</p>



<p>We have wired the <code>panic_handler</code> to <code>defmt</code> to make panicking much cheaper.
Consider this example, which is part of the project template:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/panic.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>panic!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It produces this output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb panic
<span>0.000000 INFO main
0.000001 ERROR panicked at src/bin/panic.rs:11:5
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x00000554 - __bkpt

   7: 0x00000238 - ResetTrampoline
   8: 0x00000214 - Reset
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you may have seen from our previous posts with <code>probe-run</code> you get a stack backtrace for free!</p>

<h2 id="binary-size">Binary size</h2>

<p>What I wanted to highlight here is the binary size.
Here's the output of <code>cargo-size</code> (part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a> project).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> panic <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>section              size        addr

.rodata               360       0x600
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An here's the output of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat"><code>cargo-bloat</code></a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n</span> 5 <span>--bin</span> panic

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> <code>core::fmt</code> function calls there and that's what makes the binary so small.</p>

<h2 id="vs-rprintln">vs <code>rprintln!</code></h2>

<p>Let's compare against a program that uses <a href="https://docs.rs/rtt-target/0.2.0/rtt_target/macro.rprintln.html"><code>rtt_target::rprintln</code></a>, which is hard-wired to <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry</span><span>]</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The biggest functions are <code>core::fmt</code> related.
The <code>defmt</code>-powered <code>panic</code> uses 1.59 KB of Flash (<code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code>); <code>panic-rprintln</code> uses 13.85 KB.
That's almost a whopping 9x savings.

<p><em>programs compiled with <code>-Oz</code> and <code>lto=fat</code></em></p>

<p>Now you can panic without reservation: panic messages are no longer binary-size expensive.
Also, no more need to reach out for crates that discard panic information, like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt"><code>panic-halt</code></a>, to keep the binary size low.</p>



<p>If you have used the <code>log</code> crate before you know that it supports 5 logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn and error – sorted from lowest severity to highest.
<code>defmt</code> supports the same five levels through 5 logging macros: <code>trace!</code>, <code>debug!</code>, <code>info!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>error!</code>.
Let's see them in action:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/levels.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"info"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>trace!</span><span>(</span><span>"trace"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>warn!</span><span>(</span><span>"warn"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>error!</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 TRACE trace
0.000002 WARN warn
0.000003 DEBUG debug
0.000004 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not shown above but the logging level (e.g. INFO) gets nicely colored in the terminal output.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The main reason for having logging levels is to be able to filter some of them out.
If we re-run the <code>levels</code> example but compile it using the <code>release</code> profile we get less output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rrb` is an alias for `run --release --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rrb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 WARN warn
0.000002 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because the project template has been configured to report all logging levels when the <code>dev</code> profile is used, but only INFO and higher severity logs when the <code>release</code> profile is used.</p>

<p><code>defmt</code> defaults to logging nothing (filtering everything out) but this behavior can be configured via Cargo features.</p>

<p>If you look at the project template's <code>Cargo.toml</code> you'll see that the <code>defmt-default</code> feature is enabled for the top crate (<code>my-app</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[features]</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"defmt-default"</span><span>,</span>
<span># "dependency-a/defmt-trace",</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defmt-default</code> behavior logs at TRACE level and higher severity if profile is <code>dev</code> and log INFO and up if profile is <code>release</code>.
The other features like <code>defmt-warning</code> enable logging at the specified level (WARN) and up regardless of the compilation profile (<code>dev</code> or <code>release</code>).</p>

<p>Logging filters can be configured per crate using Cargo features.
If you have used the <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/"><code>env_logger</code></a> crate you may have used the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to enable logging in dependencies.
With <code>env_logger</code> you use <code>RUST_LOG=dep-a=debug,dep-b=info</code> to enable DEBUG logging in <code>dep-a</code> and INFO logging in <code>dep-b</code>.
With <code>defmt</code> that configuration is done in the top crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [features]
 default = [
   "defmt-default",
<span>-# "dependency-a/defmt-trace",
</span><span>+  "dep-a/defmt-debug",
+  "dep-b/defmt-info",
</span> ]
</code></pre></div>


<p>So far we have only logged string literals in our examples but <code>defmt</code> also supports formatting arguments.
<code>core::write!</code> supports a variety of formatting parameters, each one associated to a formatting trait: <code>{:?}</code> (<code>Debug</code>), <code>{}</code> (<code>Display</code>), <code>{:x}</code> (<code>Hex</code>).
<code>defmt</code> has a single formatting trait: <code>Format</code>, which is associated to the <code>{:?}</code> formatting parameter.</p>

<p><code>{:?}</code> expects a type that implements the <code>Format</code> trait.
<code>Format</code> is implemented for primitives like integers and slices.
To implement <code>Format</code> for user-defined types (structs or enums) use the <code>#[derive(Format)]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>{:?}</code>, there are formatting parameters for some primitives: e.g. <code>{:u8}</code>, <code>{:bool}</code>.
Prefer these parameters for primitives as they compress the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Best Open Social Apps in 2021</h2><p>Open source software has become a big cultural phenomenon in recent years. Because its free in every sense of the word, its especially good for companies and groups that want to self host their software due to concerns over privacy and control. Other times open source solutions are chosen by those who simply want to have the freedom to use a consistent set of tools that are not tied to a single vendor. The only problem is that there is <i>so much of it</i>. It is hard to sort through it all. So to save you the trouble, we are sharing our picks about what we consider to be the best of the best open social software out there. Enjoy!</p><p>By the way we might have jumped the gun a bit with the title but 2021 is almost here. We're pretty sure these apps will stand the test of time. We use these apps ourselves every day, we have deployed them on behalf of our clients and we are confident they will remain highly competitive options throughout 2021, and if that changes we'll update this article. Good Luck!</p><p>If these apps aren't your cup of tea, we have good news. There are hundreds of other free social apps that you can search for on github.com. Content management systems, workflow tools, collaborative document editing, microblogging software and more. Have we missed anything important? Do you have any feedback or questions?</p> <p><a href="mailto:hi@opensocial.com">Let us know!</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The IAM policy is the cornerstone of security of an AWS account. There is an oft-repeated notion of the shared responsibility model that stipulates that certain parts of security is the responsibility of the cloud provider, such as preventing malicious parties physical access to the infrastructure. On the other hand, the cloud provider gives you security controls and it is your responsibility to use them properly.</p> <p>The main security control is IAM and it is used everywhere inside AWS. With IAM you are not only able to create users for people who need access to the account but also to define what each user has access to.</p> <p>There are several types of policies, but the two most important ones are the identity-, and the resource-based policies. Whatever you do in your AWS account you’ll need to use these.</p> <h2 id="identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h2> <p>Identity-based policies are the easier of the two, as some variation of it is present in most systems. They <strong>define what an identity can do</strong>, such as a user has access to an S3 bucket.</p> <p>There are two types of identities in AWS: <strong>users and roles</strong>. By attaching a policy to an identity you can give it permissions to access resources. For example, you can attach this policy to allow a user to read an object in an S3 bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
	</span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
		</span><span>{</span><span>
			</span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
				</span><span>"s3:GetObject"</span><span>
			</span><span>],</span><span>
			</span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span>
			</span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket&gt;/text.txt"</span><span>
		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Since the policy is attached to an identity, a user in this case, there is no Principal element in the policy. On the other hand, the Resource defines the object in the bucket that the user can access.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:384px;height:265px" viewBox="0 0 384 265"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="141" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M141 26v27m-13-19h26m-13 19l-13 15m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="31" x="125.5" y="87.995">user</text><path d="M241 37c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V37" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M241 37c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="251" y="63.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M51 152L51 228.891 231 228.891 231 162 221 152 51 152z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 152v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="61" y="174.995">policy</text><path d="M52 178.297L230 178.297M52 180.297L230 180.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="67" y="195.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="67" y="211.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M141 91.08v60.88" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M156.63 49.5h78.95" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M240.76 49.5L231.76 45.5 235.76 49.5 231.76 53.5 240.76 49.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="174.75" y="42.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="372" y="251.995">A policy attached to the user gives access to a bucket</text></svg> </p> <p>Note that groups are not identities but a way to attach policies to multiple users.</p> <h3 id="users">Users</h3> <p>There is only one type of user that can be created, but depending on how they are used we can distinguish <em>natural</em> and <em>technical</em> users.</p> <p>Natural users are created for people.

These type of users usually have a password to sign in to the console and sometimes access keys to allow programmatic access to the account. Since the user is created and managed by a single person, that person is responsible for it. Also, it’s likely that multiple people have the same job, so permissions are usually attached to groups instead of the users themselves.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:301px;height:387px" viewBox="0 0 301 387"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="96" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M96 26v27M83 34h26M96 53L83 68m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="28" x="82" y="87.995">Bob</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M56 172.5H136V208.797H56z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="60" x="66" y="195.495">IAM User</text><path d="M221 178c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V178" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 178c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="231" y="204.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M6 274L6 350.891 186 350.891 186 284 176 274 6 274z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M176 274v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="16" y="296.995">policy</text><path d="M7 300.297L185 300.297M7 302.297L185 302.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="22" y="317.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="22" y="333.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M96 91.08v75.84" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M96 172.15L100 163.15 96 167.15 92 163.15 96 172.15z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="30" x="97" y="134.067">uses</text><path d="M96 208.69v65.11" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M136.12 190.5h79.63" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M220.82 190.5L211.82 186.5 215.82 190.5 211.82 194.5 220.82 190.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="154.5" y="183.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="223" x="42" y="373.995">A natural user is tied to a person</text></svg> </p> <p>Technical users allow other services access to resources inside the account.

To give access to your account, you can use a role that can be used by identities in another account. This way you don’t need to create users and transfer secrets (passwords or access keys) to grant cross-account access. Another use-case is users logging in via SAML or Cognito. Instead of creating a user for every single person who can log in, you define a role and all users assume it. Then you can give permissions to the role and all users signed in this way will gain those permissions.</p> <p>Also, AWS services use roles to gain permissions to access your account. For example, CloudTrail can put logs into a CloudWatch Log group, but it needs permission to do so. On the Trail config, you need to specify a role:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role-72cf0208de53148da9ebb597ccf983890b3c5c8ba59222865e849f81918718c9.png" integrity="sha256-cs8CCN5TFI2p67WXzPmDiQs8XIulkiKGXoSfgZGHGMk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This role allows the CloudTrail service to assume it:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role_trust-88790c9eb727ab035fd2e4d564b15ca8bb07951376ea75da8e0918ce8d92983f.png" integrity="sha256-iHkMnrcnqwNf0uTVZLFcqLsHlRN26nXajgkYzo2SmD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>And the role has the policies to access CloudWatch Logs:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_permissions-e536a8a0d9a50b84c797d688f891bdc7440c1a6c010d919b7e6bc9854dee03bd.png" integrity="sha256-5TaooNmlC4THl9aI+JG9x0QMGmwBDZGbfmvJhU3uA70=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This way you have full control over what a given service can do. And this pattern appears in many places. A Lambda function uses a role in a similar way, the S3 bucket replication gains permissions to write a bucket using a role, and AWS Organizations creates a role in the member account so that you can initialize the resources inside it.</p> <h2 id="resource-based-policies">Resource-based policies</h2> <p>What if there is no identity to attach the policies to? This is the case for anonymous access, and also when an AWS service does not use a service role, such as an API Gateway. When there is no identity, identity-based policies can not be used.</p> <p>Many, but not all, AWS services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">support resource-based policies</a>.

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>Action</code> in resource-based policies can be one that is relevant to the service. A bucket policy can allow <code>s3:GetObject</code>, a role the <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, while a Lambda the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>Resource,</code> when needed, can only start with the resource’s own ARN. This makes sense as one resource can only give access to itself or things below it but not to unrelated resources.</p> <p>How the resource defines who gets access and how specific this control is depends on the service. The <code>Principal</code> element is always present and that can define users, roles, services, other accounts, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">a few other things</a>.</p> <p>But, especially with services, this is not granular enough. For example, when a role’s trust policy defines the Lambda service, it does not specify <em>which</em> Lambda function to trust. Similarly, the role for the CloudTrail allows the <code>cloudtrail.amazonaws.com</code> service, but there is no further restrictions on <em>which trail</em>.</p> <p>Some resource policies support conditions to allow only a given resource. For example, the policy for a Lambda function is able to selectively allow the API which can call it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"ArnLike"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Unfortunately, there is no generic way to know which resource-based policies support further restrictions on the caller using conditions. You need to check the AWS-provided policy examples to see what conditions are possible.</p> <h2 id="using-together">Using together</h2> <p>When both types of policies are effective then you can use both to give and restrict access. When an IAM user wants to get an object from an S3 bucket then both the policy attached to the user and the one defined on the bucket are effective.</p> <h3 id="allowing-access">Allowing access</h3> <p>With most services if <em>either</em> of the policies give access to an action then it will be granted. The notable exceptions are KMS key policies and cross-account role trust policies where <em>both</em> the resource and the identity needs an explicit Allow.</p> <p>As resource-based policies can grant access to identities, the notion that a user can not do anything without attaching policies to it is not true. For example, a bucket policy can allow a user to get objects and that is effective even if the user has no permissions on its own:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Mitglieder des Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC) haben mehrere Schwachstellen in einem weit verbreiteten Cloud-System für gastronomische Betriebe entdeckt und gemeldet. In Corona-Listen und Reservierungen waren mehrere Millionen sensible Datensätze einsehbar. Der Datenbestand reichte bis zu zehn Jahre zurück. Der Cloud-Service wurde informiert und hat die Schwachstellen nach eigenen Angaben beseitigt. Der CCC empfiehlt den Verzicht auf Cloud-Lösungen und rät dazu, Daten da zu sammeln, wo sie benötigt werden – in den Restaurants.</p><div><p>Das <a href="https://cert.ccc.de/">Chaos Emergency Response Team (CERT)</a> ist vielen bekannt als das Sanitäts- und Brandschutz-Team auf <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Veranstaltungen des CCC</a>. Doch auch in der veranstaltungsfreien Zeit engagiert sich das CERT stets für die Sicherheit seines Umfelds.</p>
<h2>Digitale Corona-Listen</h2>
<p>Bei einem gemeinsamen Restaurantbesuch wurden Mitglieder des CERT gebeten, sich in eine <em>digitale</em> "Corona-Liste" einzutragen. Die gastgebenden Gastronominnen wollten die verpflichtende Datenerfassung offenbar modern und unkompliziert gestalten – mit Hilfe einer Cloud-Software.</p>
<p>Deren vollmundige Versprechen über die Sicherheit der erfassten Daten weckten Argwohn und Altruismus des CERT-Teams. Wie erwartet hatte das System akuten Bedarf an Sanitäts- und Brandschutzmaßnahmen durch Spezialkräfte des CCC.</p>
<h3>Über 87.000 Corona-Datensätze und 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen</h3>
<p>Verschiedene Schwachstellen ermöglichten den Zugriff auf insgesamt 87.313 Corona-Kontakterhebungen von 180 Restaurants, die das System aktiv nutzten*.</p>
<p>Im betroffenen System wurden jedoch nicht nur Corona-Listen, sondern auch Reservierungen, Bestellungen und Kassenumsätze gespeichert. <a href="https://archive.is/BS7zG">Der Cloud-Service wirbt damit</a>, monatlich über 96 Mio. Euro Umsatz von 7,7 Mio. Kundinnen sowie 600.000 Reservierungen über das System abzuwickeln*. Persönliche Daten von Besucherinnen werden vor allem bei Reservierungen und Corona-Registrierungen erfasst.</p>
<p>Insgesamt war der Zugriff auf 4,8 Mio. Personendatensätze aus über 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen möglich, wie der Cloud-Service bestätigt*.</p>
<h3>Daten reichen über ein Jahrzehnt zurück</h3>
<p>Erstaunt stellte das CERT fest, dass im System personenbezogene Daten gespeichert sind, die teilweise ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zurückreichen. Der Cloud-Service versteht sich als "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service#Datenschutz_(DSGVO">Auftragsverarbeiter</a>" und verortet die Verantwortung zur Löschung bei den Gastronominnen. Die wiederum schienen sich dessen oft nicht bewusst zu sein und vertrauten verständlicherweise auf die Full-Service-Cloud.</p>
<h2>Mehrere Schwachstellen</h2>
<h3>Mangelndes Rechte-Management</h3>
<p>Durch eine fehlerhafte Prüfung der Zugriffsrechte konnte im Handumdrehen administrativer Vollzugriff auf sämtliche im System gespeicherten Daten erlangt werden. Andere Fehler in der API ermöglichten Nutzerinnen auch ohne besondere Rechte den Zugriff auf schützenswerte Daten, die nicht für Ihre Augen bestimmt waren. So konnte zum Beispiel Restaurant A auf die Corona-Daten von Restaurant B zugreifen.</p>
<h3>Unzureichend geschützte Passwörter</h3>
<p>Auch unzureichend geschützte Passwörter konnten mittels einfachem API-Request abgerufen werden. Dabei fielen dem Katastrophenschutz des CCC nicht nur Hashes, sondern auch Passwörter im Klartext auf. Für neuere Accounts wurde immerhin eine zeitgemäße Hashing-Methode verwendet.  Dennoch hätten in einer Stichprobe über 25% der Passwörter aus ihren Hashes geborgen werden können. Triviale Passwörter wie "1234" deuteten auf das Fehlen einer angemessenen Passwortrichtlinie hin.</p>
<p>Das Risiko schlecht geschützter Passwörter geht über den betroffenen Dienst hinaus, weil Nutzerinnen oft dazu neigen, das gleiche Passwort für mehrere Accounts zu verwenden.</p>
<h3>Großzügiges Bestellsystem</h3>
<p>Haben Sie in der Vergangenheit einmal vergeblich auf Ihr bestelltes Essen gewartet? Oder wurde Ihnen in einer Hamburger Eck-Kneipe mit 42 Litern Bier eine spontane Freude bereitet? Vielleicht hatte einfach nur eine brasilianische Teenagerin Spaß an der offenen API… Diese hat es ohne weitere Hindernisse ermöglicht,</p>
<ul>
<li>die Speisekarten aller Restaurants einzusehen und damit</li>
<li>für Dritte Bestellungen <em>auszulösen</em> oder zu <em>stornieren</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Selbstverständlich unter Umgehung sämtlicher gesetzter Einschränkungen. Weltweiter, grenzenloser Service!</p>
<h3>Schnelle Reaktion des Cloud-Anbieters</h3>
<p>Alle gefundenen Schwachstellen wurden durch die CERT-Mitglieder <em>Sophie, Martin, cwoomio, <br> deinkoks, Lady_Raven, Metal_Warrior, <br> Wellenformer, blubbel und cbro</em> <br> schriftlich dokumentiert und dem Betreiber gastronovi mit der Bitte um Behebung mitgeteilt.</p>
<p>In einer zügigen Reaktion bestätigte gastronovi alle gemeldeten Schwachstellen und machte sich an die umgehende Behandlung. Den lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen folgt auf Rat des CCC nun auch eine ausführliche Diagnostik des Systems durch geschultes Fachpersonal.</p>
<h2>CCC rät von digitalen "Corona-Listen" ab</h2>
<p>Laut gastronovi sind die gemeldeten Schwachstellen inzwischen kuriert. Doch auch <a href="https://www.modzero.com/modlog/archives/2020/07/06/mit_webapps_gegen_covid-19/index.html">in den Systemen anderer Cloud-Services wurden bereits ähnliche Schwachstellen gefunden</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Denken first, digital second",</em> kommentiert Linus Neumann, Sprecher des Chaos Computer Clubs. <em>"Viele digitale Corona-Listen wurden mit der heißen Nadel gestrickt und machen schwer zu haltende Datenschutzversprechen. Die Sicherheit eines Papiersystems ist hingegen auch für Laien leicht zu beurteilen."</em></p>
<p>So haben etablierte Cloud-Services bestehende Systeme oft nur hastig "umfunktioniert", statt sich spezifisch mit den Sicherheits- und Datenschutzanforderungen des Contact-Tracings auseinanderzusetzen.</p>
<p><em>"Die sensiblen Daten landen dann nicht etwa beim Restaurant, sondern auf einem großen Haufen irgendwo im Internet, wo sie die nächsten Jahre auf interessierte Hackerinnen warten."</em></p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für Besucherinnen</h3>
<p>Sollte Ihr präferiertes Restaurant auf Cloud-Erfassung <em>bestehen</em>, raten wir zu neuen kulinarischen Abenteuern in anderen Etablissements.</p>
<p>Doch auch bei papierbasierter Erfassung empfiehlt der CCC das <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger/status/1289113251461173248">Einrichten einer gesonderten pseudonymen E-Mail-Adresse nur für diesen Zweck</a>. Viele kostenlose Dienstanbieter ermöglichen zum Beispiel eine Weiterleitung von eingehenden Nachrichten an die eigentliche E-Mail-Adresse.</p>
<p>Fünfzehn Minuten Aufwand gewährleisten Datensparsamkeit ohne das Risiko, eine wichtige Warnung zu verpassen.</p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für die sichere Erfassung</h3>
<p>Der Chaos Computer Club rät grundsätzlich von digitalen Corona-Listen ab – erst recht, wenn diese ihre Daten in einer Cloud speichern, statt im Restaurant.</p>
<p>Auch in unseren eigenen Hackspaces verwenden wir folgendes Papier-System:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jede Besucherin oder Gruppe erhält einen <em>gesonderten Zettel</em> zur Erfassung, damit nicht die Daten anderer Gäste eingesehen werden können.</li>
<li>Der ausgefüllte Zettel wird in einen verschlossenen Briefkasten geworfen, um ihn dort <em>vor neugierigen Blicken zu schützen</em>.</li>
<li>Dieser wird am Ende des Tages in einen Umschlag geleert, welcher mit dem <em>Datum des erfassten Tages beschriftet und versiegelt</em> wird.</li>
<li>Die versiegelten Umschläge werden an einem <em>sicheren Ort</em> aufbewahrt.</li>
<li>Täglich wird ein Umschlag <em>sicher vernichtet</em>, dessen Frist abgelaufen ist – und ein neuer kommt hinzu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber</h3>
<p>Das Ziel, Besucherinnen im Falle eines Falles schnell informieren zu können, ist legitim und wichtig. Dennoch wurden dem Unterfangen eine Reihe unnötiger Probleme in den Weg gelegt</p>
<ol>
<li>Es häufen sich die Fälle, in denen die <a href="https://www.haufe.de/compliance/recht-politik/polizeizugriff-auf-corona-gaestelisten-der-gastronomie-unzulaessig_230132_522174.html">Listen für Polizei-Ermittlungen zweckentfremdet wurden</a>. Derartige Maßnahmen motivieren Besucherinnen, falsche Daten in die Listen einzutragen.</li>
<li>Der Gesetzgeber sieht keinen Anlass, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/gastro-vorratsdatenspeicherung-bundesregierung-will-corona-listen-nicht-besser-schuetzen/">diesem Datenmissbrauch ein Ende zu setzen</a>.  Damit wird das geringe verbliebene Vertrauen weiter untergraben.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/corona-und-restaurants-kundendaten-fuer-einen-schnellen-flirt-a-453e410e-50d4-4d2a-a128-fdaa2b34eee2">In vielen Einrichtungen liegen die Listen offen aus, was die Sorge vor unerwünschtem Kontakt durch andere Gäste weckt</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leichtfertig verspieltes Vertrauen kann jetzt nur noch durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung zurückgewonnen werden.</p>

However, if a page is considered fast by Core Web Vitals, but there isn’t enough real-world data for the page, it won’t display the label.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1234" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png" alt="Fast page label" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png 2048w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-300x181.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1024x617.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-768x463.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1536x926.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1046x630.png 1046w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>Chrome 85 will have “Fast page” label when a user long-presses a link</figcaption></figure><p>The label is likely a taste of how Google will be incorporating Core Web Vitals into Google Search. It’s highly probable that Google will use a label or icon to denote fast pages, similar to what they do now for AMP pages. I also predict that sites will be told that more searchers click on results that have a fast symbol, and therefore they’ll need to score “Good” on Core Web Vitals, or they may not rank as well. I think that presupposition will age well come next year.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="778" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png 750w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-289x300.png 289w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-607x630.png 607w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-150x156.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure><p>For now, the label will be limited to Chrome users that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284">Lite mode</a> (an Android-only feature) or have “<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9116376">Make searches and browsing better</a>” turned on (a setting that sends URLs of pages you visit to Google).</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>In this tutorial, we will see how to compile and install FFmpeg with VMAF support using libvmaf and then we shall see how to compute or calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg with VMAF support enabled.</b></p><hr><p><strong>FFmpeg</strong> has always been at the top of everyone’s mind when it came to open source video compression software and is best described by Wikipedia as</p><blockquote><p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source project consisting of a vast software suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.</p></blockquote><p><strong>VMAF from Netflix</strong> stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p><p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. But, installing and using them appears to be difficult for a large number of users.</p><p>I see these questions often on Stackoverflow and similar websites -</p><ul><li>how to compute VMAF?</li><li>how do I compile VMAF on Ubuntu?</li><li>how do I calcuate VMAF using FFmpeg?</li><li>no such filter <code>libvmaf</code> when trying to use VMAF with FFmpeg.</li><li>VMAF example commandline</li></ul><p>and the list simply goes on. So, I decided to write down the steps of compiling and installing VMAF, FFmpeg, and computing VMAF with FFmpeg. Along the way, I’ll show you a few gotchas and common errors in the installation and usage procedure.</p><h2 id="step-0-machine-setup">Step 0: Machine Setup</h2><p>For the purpose of this document, I will set up a new $5 droplet on DigitalOcean with Ubuntu 18.04 as its operating system.</p><p>By the way, if you <a href="https://m.do.co/c/90eb9b431b9e">click here</a>, you'll receive $100 in DigitalOcean credits over 60 days! That's 60 days and $100 to experiment and play around with DigitalOcean :)</p><h2 id="step-1-install-vmaf-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 1: Install VMAF on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>You can use VMAF in several different ways and you can <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf">read about it here</a>. In order to use VMAF with FFmpeg, we need the help of <code>libvmaf</code> - a C library that can be used with C/C++ code. In other words, we can use it with FFmpeg.</p><p>So, here is how to install VMAF on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the latest release of VMAF from <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/releases">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Untar it</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">untar -xvf https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Install dependencies.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel ninja-build doxygen
pip3 install meson
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install numpy
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make and Install VMAF</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> vmaf-1.5.2/
sudo make 
sudo make install
</code></pre></div><p>Make a note of where VMAF’s <code>libvmaf</code> got installed. In my machine, it was installed to <code>/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code> as per the console log.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Installing src/libvmaf.so.0.0.0 to /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-2-install-ffmpeg-with-vmaf-support-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 2: Install FFmpeg with VMAF support on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>The first part is complete and you have successfully installed VMAF onto your machine. Now, let’s compile and install FFmpeg with VMAF support. These instructions are taken from <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu">FFmpeg’s Ubuntu Compilation Guide</a></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the Dependencies (including <code>nasm</code>). And, remember to create the following folders</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir -p ~/ffmpeg_sources ~/bin
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install the Video and Audio Codecs that you are going to need. I installed <code>libx264</code>, <code>libx265-dev</code>, <code>libnuma-dev</code>, <code>libvpx-dev</code>, <code>libfdk-aac-dev</code>, <code>libmp3lame-dev</code>, and <code>libopus-dev</code>.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make sure FFmpeg knows where to find <code>libvmaf</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

You should now have an FFmpeg build with VMAF enabled.</p><h2 id="step-3-computing-ffmpeg-with-vmaf">Step 3: Computing FFmpeg with VMAF</h2><p>Now let’s see how we can calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg and VMAF.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let’s create two test videos - a 1920x1080p30 video and a 1280x720p30 video using FFmpeg’s built-in libraries that generates test data. The commandlines are shown below and as you can see, it will generate two 5-second duration clips, 30 fps, of 1920x1080p and 1280x720p resolution.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1920x1080:rate=<span>30</span> test_1080p30.mpg
bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1280x720:rate=<span>30</span> test_720p30.mpg
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Compute the VMAF score between the two videos.</strong><br>From the commandline below, you can see that we are providing the two input sequences, and then we are scaling both to 1920x1080 using a <code>bicubic</code> filter. This is important because VMAF works only on sequences having the same resolution (and the frame rate should match, else you’ll have serious problems). We are also asking FFmpeg to compute the PSNR score for these two sequences.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mpg -i test_1080p30.mpg -filter_complex <span>"[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; [main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json"</span> -f null -
</code></pre></div><p>and it should print the VMAF score as follows on the console</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">[libvmaf @ 0x55803f80c7c0] VMAF score: 86.375268
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed per-frame details are contained in the JSON file. It contains the per-frame VMAF and PSNR scores as requested.</li><li>In FFmpeg’s filter, you can use either <code>bicubic</code> or <code>lancsoz</code> filters for the upsampling process. Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51ee9ed12">suggests</a> that <code>bicubic</code> is a better choice.</li></ol><h2 id="options-for-vmaf-using-ffmpeg">Options for VMAF using FFmpeg</h2><p>The following commandline options are available in FFmpeg for computing VMAF.</p><ul><li><code>model_path</code>
Set the model path which is to be used for SVM. Default value: <code>/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl</code></li><li><code>log_path</code>
Set the file path to be used to store logs.</li><li><code>log_fmt</code>
Set the format of the log file (xml or json).</li><li><code>enable_transform</code>
This option can enable/disable the score_transform applied to the final predicted VMAF score, if you have specified score_transform option in the input parameter file passed to run_vmaf_training.py Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>phone_model</code>
Invokes the phone model which will generate VMAF scores higher than in the regular model, which is more suitable for laptop, TV, etc. viewing conditions. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>psnr</code>
Enables computing psnr along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ssim</code>
Enables computing ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ms_ssim</code>
Enables computing ms_ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>pool</code>
Set the pool method to be used for computing vmaf. Options are <code>min</code>, <code>harmonic_mean</code> or <code>mean</code> (default).</li><li><code>n_threads</code>
Set number of threads to be used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>0</code>, which makes use of all available logical processors.</li><li><code>n_subsample</code>
Set interval for frame subsampling used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>1</code></li><li><code>enable_conf_interval</code>
Enables confidence interval. Default value: <code>false</code></li></ul><h2 id="common-problems-while-using-vmaf-and-ffmpeg">Common problems while using VMAF and FFmpeg.</h2><p>P1. While installing FFmpeg from the official compilation guide on Ubuntu 18.04, you will face this error <code>ERROR: gnutls not found using pkg-config</code>. To prevent this, you need to install <code>sudo apt-get install libunistring-dev</code>.</p><p>P2. Another common problem when running FFmpeg with VMAF is this <code>error libvmaf xxx not found using pkg config</code>. This means that while compiling FFmpeg, you didn’t tell it where the <code>libvmaf</code> files are. Simply run the export command and it should fix the issue.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
</code></pre></div><h2 id="thats-it">That’s It</h2><p>I hope you were able to follow this guide and could successfully install VMAF, FFmpeg and compute the VMAF score using FFmpeg.

<p>
	(part of <a href="https://sive.rs/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h3>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h3><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="https://sive.rs/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h3>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h3><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h3>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h3><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h3>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h3><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h3>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h3><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h3>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h3><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h3>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h3><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

Not all the uppers and lowers will need to be bolted in, but each of the uppers and lowers has the screw hole just in case.  This just makes it easier to keep parts organized.  With all of them bolted it should look like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_33687"><div>

This lets me change cables as I want, with a single cord grip being a bit more economical than a bunch of USB ports that have to get changed over time.  After all, this one will live on a desk.

It scrapes a bit, but it fits!  You can see the Pi4 in there too.

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><em>Edit from 2015/12/17: Memory model described in this article is deprecated starting Apache Spark 1.6+, the new memory model is based on UnifiedMemoryManager&nbsp;and described in <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">this article</a></em></p>
<p>Over the recent time I’ve answered a series of questions related to ApacheSpark architecture on StackOverflow. All of them seem to be caused by the absence of a good general description of the Spark architecture in the internet. Even official guide does not have that many details and of cause it lacks good diagrams. Same for the “Learning Spark” book and the materials of official workshops.</p>
<p>In this article I would try to fix this and provide a single-stop shop guide for Spark architecture in general and some most popular questions on its concepts. This article is not for complete beginners – it will not provide you an insight on the Spark main programming abstractions (RDD and DAG), but requires their knowledge as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>This is the first&nbsp;article in a series. The second one regarding shuffle <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-architecture-shuffle/" target="_blank">is available here</a>. The third one about new memory management model <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the official picture available on the <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html">http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official-300x140.png?resize=300%2C140" alt="Spark Architecture Official" width="300" height="140" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?w=607&amp;ssl=1 607w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As you might see, it has many terms introduced at the same time – “executor”, “task”, “cache”, “Worker Node” and so on. When I started to learn the Spark concepts some time ago, it was almost the only picture about Spark architecture available over the internet and now the things didn’t change much. I personally don’t really like this because it does not show some important concepts or shows them not in the best way.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning. Any, any Spark process that would ever work on your cluster or local machine is a JVM process. As for any JVM process, you can configure its heap size with <em>-Xmx</em> and <em>-Xms</em> flags of the JVM. How does this process use its heap memory and why does it need it at all? Here’s the diagram of Spark memory allocation inside of the JVM heap:</p>

<p>By default, Spark starts with 512MB JVM heap. To be on a safe side and avoid OOM error Spark allows to utilize only 90% of the heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em> parameter of Spark. Ok, as you might have heard of Spark as an in-memory tool, Spark allows you to store some data in memory. If you have read my article here <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/">https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/</a>, you should understand that Spark is not really in-memory tool, it just utilizes the memory for its LRU cache (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms</a>). So some amount of memory is reserved for the caching of the data you are processing, and this part is usually 60% of the safe heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> parameter. So if you want to know how much data you can cache in Spark, you should take the sum of all the heap sizes for all the executors, multiply it by <em>safetyFraction</em> and by <em>storage.memoryFraction</em>, and by default it is 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54 or 54% of the total heap size you allow Spark to use.</p>
<p>Now a bit more about the shuffle memory. It is calculated as “Heap Size” * <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> * <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em>. Default value for <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> is 0.8 or 80%, default value for <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em> is 0.2 or 20%. So finally you can use up to 0.8*0.2 = 0.16 or 16% of the JVM heap for the shuffle. But how does Spark uses this memory? You can get more details on this here (<a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala">https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala</a>), but in general Spark uses this memory for the exact task it is called after – for Shuffle. When the shuffle is performed, sometimes you as well need to sort the data. When you sort the data, you usually need a buffer to store the sorted data (remember, you cannot modify the data in the LRU cache in place as it is there to be reused later). So it needs some amount of RAM to store the sorted chunks of data. What happens if you don’t have enough memory to sort the data? There is a wide range of algorithms usually referenced as “external sorting” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting</a>) that allows you to sort the data chunk-by-chunk and then merge the final result together.</p>
<p>The last part of RAM I haven’t yet cover is “unroll” memory. The amount of RAM that is allowed to be utilized by unroll process is <em>spark.storage.unrollFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em>, which with the default values equal to 0.2 * 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.108 or 10.8% of the heap. This is the memory that can be used when you are unrolling the block of data into the memory. Why do you need to unroll it after all? Spark allows you to store the data both in serialized and deserialized form. The data in serialized form cannot be used directly, so you have to unroll it before using, so this is the RAM that is used for unrolling. It is shared with the storage RAM, which means that if you need some memory to unroll the data, this might cause dropping some of the partitions stored in the Spark LRU cache.</p>
<p>This is great, because at the moment you know what exactly Spark process is and how it utilizes the memory of its JVM processes. Now let’s switch to the cluster mode – when you start a Spark cluster, how does it really look like? I like YARN so I would cover how it works in YARN, but in general it is the same for any cluster manager you use:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN-1024x826.png?resize=625%2C504" alt="Spark Architecture On YARN" width="625" height="504" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=1024%2C826&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=624%2C503&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1816&amp;ssl=1 1816w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When you have a YARN cluster, it has a YARN Resource Manager daemon that controls the cluster resources (practically memory) and a series of YARN Node Managers running on the cluster nodes and controlling node resource utilization. From the YARN standpoint, each node represents a pool of RAM that you have a control over. When you request some resources from YARN Resource Manager, it gives you information of which Node Managers you can contact to bring up the execution containers for you. Each execution container is a JVM with requested heap size. JVM locations are chosen by the YARN Resource Manager and you have no control over it – if the node has 64GB of RAM controlled by YARN (<em>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</em> setting in yarn-site.xml) and you request 10 executors with 4GB each, all of them can be easily started on a single YARN node even if you have a big cluster.</p>
<p>When you start Spark cluster on top of YARN, you specify the amount of executors you need (<em>–num-executors</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.instances</em> parameter), amount of memory to be used for each of the executors (<em>–executor-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.memory </em>&nbsp;parameter), amount of cores allowed to use for each executors (<em>–executor-cores</em> flag of <em>spark.executor.cores</em> parameter), and amount of cores dedicated for each task’s execution (<em>spark.task.cpus</em> parameter). Also you specify the amount of memory to be used by the driver application (<em>–driver-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.driver.memory</em> parameter).</p>
<p>When you execute something on a cluster, the processing of your job is split up into stages, and each stage is split into tasks. Each task is scheduled separately. You can consider each of the JVMs working as executors as a pool of task execution slots, each executor would give you <em>spark.executor.cores</em> / <em>spark.task.cpus</em> execution slots for your tasks, with a total of <em>spark.executor.instances</em> executors. Here’s&nbsp;an example. The cluster with 12 nodes running YARN Node Managers, 64GB of RAM each and 32 CPU cores each (16 physical cores with hyper threading). This way on each node you can start 2 executors with 26GB of RAM each (leave some RAM for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode), each executor with 12 cores to be utilized for tasks (leave some cores for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode). So In total your cluster would handle 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 12 cores per executor / 1 core for each task = 288 task slots. This means that your Spark cluster would be able to run up to 288 tasks in parallel thus utilizing almost all the resources you have on this cluster. The amount of RAM you can use for caching your data on this cluster is 0.9 <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction&nbsp;</em>* 0.6 <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction&nbsp;</em>* 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 26 GB per executor = 336.96 GB. Not that much, but in most cases it is enough.</p>
<p>So far so good, now you know how the Spark uses its JVM’s memory and what are the execution slots you have on your cluster. As you might already noticed, I didn’t stop in details on what the “task” really is. This would be a subject of the next article, but basically it is a single unit of work performed by Spark, and is executed as a <strong><em>thread</em></strong> in the executor JVM. This is the secret under the Spark low job startup time – forking additional thread inside of the JVM is much faster that bringing up the whole JVM, which is performed when you start a MapReduce job in Hadoop.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on another Spark abstraction called “<em><strong>partition</strong></em>”. All the data you work with in Spark is split into partitions. What a single partition is and how is it determined? Partition size completely depends on the data source you use. For most of the methods to read the data in Spark you can specify the amount of partitions you want to have in your RDD. When you read a file from HDFS, you use Hadoop’s InputFormat to make it. By default each input split returned by InputFormat is mapped to a single partition in RDD. For most of the files on HDFS single input split is generated for a single block of data stored on HDFS, which equals to approximately 64MB of 128MB of data. Approximately, because the data in HDFS is split on exact block boundaries in bytes, but when it is processed it is split on the record splits. For text file the splitting character is the newline char, for sequence file it is the block end and so on. The only exception of this rule is compressed files – if you have the whole text file compressed, then it cannot be split into records and the whole file would become a single input split and thus a single partition in …</p></div></div>

<p>The amount of folks who are up in arms about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Novotny's views on email based workflows in Linux</a> put a smirk on my face today, but I figured I would post my own opinions, having both spent way too many hours with mutt, offlineimap, postfix, and so on. I even wrote an entire article series on this for Ars Technica that is so old I can't even find it on the web any more. And Lee Hutchinson's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version is from 2014</a>! </p>

<p>How can someone who is wanting to contribute to the kernel possibly not know how to send a plain text email? If you can't do that then you have no business in the kernel right?</p>

<p>It's not a matter of can't, it's a matter of won't. There's a reason no one writes their resumes in LaTeX either.  Sure, I can do it. I figured it out, achievement unlocked. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at the amount of <em>core contributors to Kubernetes</em> that we routinely find aren't subscribed to the main mailing list. Sending git formatted patches over email, are you kidding? Most of my open source collaborators aren't even  <em>reading</em> their emails lol. </p>

<p>You don't send a mail to the list to propose something, you <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write an enhancement proposal</a> and if you're nice, you might mention it on a list, but all that activity happens in GitHub. And if you want a meaty discussion you hop onto Zoom and discuss it high bandwidth style with your SIG before moving on. You're not going to find lengthy discussions about technical features on many of our mailing lists, you'll find them in the GitHub issues, PR comments, and meeting transcripts. </p>

<ul>
<li>VMware (my employer) has incredible Kubernetes and cloud native content: <a href="https://tgik.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TGIK</a>  is all on YouTube. </li>
<li>It's not a coincidence that <a href="https://www.openshift.com/streaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenShift streams on twitch</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>No fair you say! There's a difference between using/consuming technical content and coordinating/running an entire project. That's the point, not any more! </p>

<p>Watch how Martin Wimpress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ICRjjjMbEE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">does a live package update in Ubuntu MATE</a>. That level of interaction with the audience isn't just the future of OSS development, it's the present. Our next kernel people, Debian maintainers, library maintainers, and everything inbetween are sitting in places like this and this is how they interact with themselves and their communities. There's just too much awesome shit in the world for people to slow down to figure out emails and mailman. And if you think this is just about email, wait until you see how much coordination and awesome stuff is happening in Discord. Yep, this is about IRC too, all of it. </p>

<p>I hear ya, I wish plaintext wasn't on the way out as a workflow, but at the end of the day, most projects aren't Linux. You can't afford an email mailing list workflow, you need to be where the developers are. New developers coming into the field are as likely to be on AOL than setting up mutt, that's just how it ended up. The distribution developers know how to do this, it's part of their job, but let's not kid ourselves,  the eyeballs are not on mailing lists.</p>

<p>Linux is missing an entire generation of new talent due to this. I don't sweat it, Linux is fundamental technology, it'll survive just fine, but it'll continue to be a workflow that won't jive with a number of people coming into the field. </p>

<p>Also it's pretty evident from most Microsoft conspiracy comments that no one bothered to look up Sarah's OSS credentials, but of course, that didn't surprise you either. Her points still stand if you replace GitHub with GitLab, or whatever tool you prefer. </p>
