Bitcoin consumes more energy than Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c69d4a4-2626-418d-813c-7337b8d5110d" rel="noopener"><strong>combined</strong></a>. Within 12 years Bitcoin has become one of the fastest-growing sources of climate change in the world.</p><p id="6a6e">As an inadequate summary, Bitcoin is ‘mined’ by <a href="https://twitter.com/AthoughtHeist/status/1363391630414381058" rel="noopener">solv<span id="rmm">i</span>ng purposefully hard ‘Sudoku’ puzzles</a> (making them rare) which you could exchange for heroin. No one does anymore because it’s become an asset, not a currency. The hardware to solve these problems has also become so intense that it inhales electricity, and runs all the time. Bitcoin consumes energy<em> by design</em>.</p><p id="1a42">If machines wanted to destroy humanity they could not come up with a better avatar than Bitcoin. Who needs to take over the military? Techbros will happily sell us out for some coin. <strong>The machines have somehow got us to run them 24/7, warming the fuck out of <em>our</em> Earth, and all they have to do is give us some made-up tokens.</strong></p><p id="9019">The greatest myth of SciFi was that we would resist AI. People will happily <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-laser-eyes-senator-cynthia-lummis-1570644" rel="noopener">change their profile pics to laser eyes</a> while it farts up the Earth. SciFi makes us think AI would be ‘sentient’, meaning like us, when in fact life just emerges out of other life in different and mutually incomprehensible forms. Behold Bitcoin.</p><p id="df7c">Is Bitcoin artificially intelligent? You could say obviously not, but are <em>we</em> obviously intelligent? This is still debated within philosophy but also, just look around *gestures at everything*.</p><p id="0250">I’d say that humans are actually uniquely unqualified to judge something as AI because we’re so fucking dumb. We’ve been living with full legal, artificial persons since at least 1600. They’re called corporations. You may have noticed them enslaving people or exploiting us today. We don’t call these things AI, but our courts certainly do. It’s literally called <em>corporate personhood.</em> They actually have <em>more</em> rights than you do. America’s Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC" rel="noopener">ruled that corporations have free speech rights</a>. All over the world they have more freedom of movement than human beings (WTF is a multinational while we’re refugees?). We don’t call them AI, but what else are they? But that’s another story.</p><p id="ae4e">I would say that AI is as AI does, and Bitcoin is certainly doing <em>something</em>. We’re waiting for something to sing fucking <a href="https://youtu.be/c8N72t7aScY?t=172" rel="noopener"><em>Daisy</em></a> to us before we call it AI, but I’d say that it’s already here. It’s just our imagination that has yet to arrive.</p><p id="20cc">I’m serious, but treat it as a thought experiment if you want. What if Bitcoin is AI? Is it good, is it bad? What it is?</p><p id="20d2">The basic colonial model of conquering anything is divide and conquer. Just throw the elites some coin and they’ll sell out the rest. Corporations did this with, well, colonialism and now it’s happening in a decentralized way with Bitcoin. The result is that Bitcoin is able to reproduce, like a virus, using entirely willing human hosts. Meanwhile the unwilling biosphere takes the brunt.</p><p id="f597">Like any lifeform, Bitcoin produces waste. We produce carbon dioxide directly when we respirate, but Bitcoin produces a shit-ton indirectly through energy usage. The energy use of Bitcoin is staggering, <a href="https://cbeci.org/cbeci/methodology" rel="noopener">an estimated 0.56% of all human energy use thus far</a>. You could say that email or gold mining produce waste, and they do, but Bitcoin is the only asset where waste is <em>all</em> it produces. Gold can at least fill your teeth. Bitcoin <em>only</em> outputs climate change.</p><p id="0100">Also like any lifeform, Bitcoin evolves <em>out of</em> other life. Nothing comes out of nowhere. In this case Bitcoin is evolving out of us, and like many times in evolution, it could kill us as well. Photosynthetic life emerged out of anaerobic bacteria, and then <a rel="noopener" href="https://indi.ca/this-isnt-the-first-climate-crisis-we-ve-caused-c6ba47b25b0b">almost killed them all</a> with their oxygen farts. That was the first life-made climate change, and the whole Earth fucking froze. Nobody cared, that’s life. Anaerobes used to dominate but now they live in deep-sea vents and our guts. That’s just their lot in life, while those vicious plankton and trees are everywhere.</p><p id="d67e">Humans think evolution is some grand progress leading up to us and it’s literally just not. Dinosaurs are much cooler. Evolution is <em>adaptation</em>, nothing else. If the environment changes, life changes, and life changes the environment. It’s entirely possibly that our carbon emissions will become the food for some other lifeform, or just immaterial to them. AI certainly doesn’t care, AI already lives in space, sipping on sunlight, taking selfies. We could end up like the anaerobes on Earth and ‘nature’ would not give a fuck. Happens all the time.</p><p id="45c9">Hence the question is not whether Bitcoin is good. It’s whether it’s <em>good for us</em>. To that the answer is obviously no. Techbros spout stuff about freedom but beware geeks bringing gifts. Bitcoin says it’s a currency<strong> </strong>but nobody fucking spends it. Bitcoin is a speculative asset, a literal gold rush. It’s even more destructive because people are now investing in the destruction of the environment at large, not just where you’re digging. There is no other output at all.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3496/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png" width="1748" height="710" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Some more on Bitcoin’s not goodness from <a href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-now-worth-50000-and-its" rel="noopener">The Phoenix</a></figcaption></figure><p id="0a90">Gold, oil, real estate, currencies — they all produce emissions and evil in many ways, but they at least do something useful to humanity. They are not destroying the Earth by design, while Bitcoin is. Bitcoin <em>only</em> reproduces and produces waste. It is, in that sense the first viral AI. Like the 30 kb of COVID-19, the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" rel="noopener">8.7 MB code of Bitcoin</a> has spread virally throughout the world, transmitting through greed.</p><p id="4e36">Again, I’m not saying that Bitcoin is bad. Life does not give a fuck about any particular avatar of life. It’s just that it’s not good for <em>us</em>.</p><p id="9983">In many ways Bitcoin is (I hope) the final avatar of capitalism. An ouroboros. A snake eating its own tail. Capitalism has long given us stuff, but Bitcoin just completely abandons the pretence of useful activity at all. Bitcoin produces… Bitcoin. That’s it. Riches that just make rich people rich. The circle is closed, the snake has eaten its tail. Bitcoin is just pure economic nihilism.</p><p id="cb2d">As I’ve said, AI could not design a better plan to take over the world if they tried. Divide and conquer humanity using our greed, rip up the Earth for more resources for machines, fart up the air for everybody else.</p><p id="4340">It’s a perfect plan, all the more perfect because it wasn’t done sentiently at all. But this is actually how evolution happens, life emerges out of other life, quite stupidly, and yet with such elegance in hindsight. History will be the judge who was sentient here, and we may not be be the victors writing it. You really think Wikipedia won’t be writing itself in a few decades?</p><p id="e7c9">Human beings should know that we’re fucked with climate change, but we’re fucking ourselves even more with Bitcoin, and we’re quite stupidly proud of ourselves. Forget AI. Are you sure we’re even “I”?</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>In 1921, <em>Aidan de Brune</em> packed his backpack and walked around the entire continent of Australia by the coastline. We are (almost) sure he is the only person who ever did that. Even more impressive, he did it all alone and without assistance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-1">
<p>
I've thought about adding these for a while, but had no specific need for them.
Finally, somebody asked for it, and I wrote the code. Now that I can, I will
probably use these all the time. The new capability can override the usual
numerical tic labels on the x axis, and instead use text from a column in the
data stream.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious use case is labelled bar graphs:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# label value</span>
<span>      aaa     2</span>
<span>      bbb     3</span>
<span>      ccc     5</span>
<span>      ddd     2"</span> | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --with <span>'boxes fill solid border lt -1'</span> <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-basic.svg" alt="xticlabels-basic.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
But the usage is completely generic. All <code>--xticlabels</code> does, is to accept a
data column as labels for the x-axis tics. Everything else that's supported by
<code>feedgnuplot</code> and <code>gnuplot</code> works as before. For instance, I can give a domain,
and use a style that takes <code>y</code> values <i>and</i> a color:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# x label y color</span>
<span>        5 aaa   2 1</span>
<span>        6 bbb   3 2</span>
<span>       10 ccc   5 4</span>
<span>       11 ddd   2 1"</span> | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl --domain <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --tuplesizeall 3 <span>\</span>
            --with <span>'points pt 7 ps 2 palette'</span> <span>\</span>
            --xmin 4 --xmax 12 <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --ymax 6 <span>\</span>
            --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-points-palette.svg" alt="xticlabels-points-palette.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
And we can use <code>gnuplot</code>'s support for clustered histograms:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# x label a b</span>
<span>        5 aaa   2 1</span>
<span>        6 bbb   3 2</span>
<span>       10 ccc   5 4</span>
<span>       11 ddd   2 1"</span> | <span>\</span>
vnl-filter -p label,a,b | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style data histogram'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style histogram cluster gap 2'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style fill solid border lt -1'</span> <span>\</span>
            --autolegend <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-clustered.svg" alt="xticlabels-clustered.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
Or we can stack the bars on top of one another:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# x label a b</span>
<span>        5 aaa   2 1</span>
<span>        6 bbb   3 2</span>
<span>       10 ccc   5 4</span>
<span>       11 ddd   2 1"</span> | <span>\</span>
vnl-filter -p label,a,b | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style data histogram'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style histogram rowstacked'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'boxwidth 0.8'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style fill solid border lt -1'</span> <span>\</span>
            --autolegend <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-stacked.svg" alt="xticlabels-stacked.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
This is <code>gnuplot</code>'s "row stacking". It also supports "column stacking", which
effectively transposes the data, and it's not obvious to me that makes sense in
the context of <code>feedgnuplot</code>. Similarly, it can label <code>y</code> and/or <code>z</code> axes; I
can't think of a specific use case, so I don't have a realistic usage in mind,
and I don't support that yet. If anybody can think of a use case, email me.
</p>

<p>
Notes and limitations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Since with <code>--domain</code> you can pass in both an <code>x</code> value <i>and</i> a tic label, it
is possible to give it conflicting tic labels for the same <code>x</code> value.
<code>gnuplot</code> itself has this problem too, and it just takes the last label it has
for a given <code>x</code>. This is probably good-enough.
</li>

<li><code>feedgnuplot</code> uses whitespace-separated columns with no escape mechanism, so
the field labels cannot have whitespace in it. Fixing this is probably not
worth the effort.
</li>

<li>These tic labels do not count towards the <code>tuplesize</code>
</li>

<li>I really need to add a similar feature to <a href="https://github.com/dkogan/gnuplotlib"><code>gnuplotlib</code></a>. This will happen when
I need it or when somebody asks for it, whichever comes first.
</li>
</ul>

    <h4>What is constexpr.js?</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/fctorial/ConstexprJS">constexpr.js</a> is a static site generator which doesn't force you to learn a domain specific language.
        When using this tool, you use javascript and usual DOM manipulation methods to generate the webpage. The tool
        will render the page using chrome, and once it has finished rendering, it will save the rendered state of the
        page as a new html file. This new html file will look exactly like the original page after it has finished rendering.
        For example, the tool converts <a href="https://fctorial.github.io/demos/constexpr.js/input.html">this</a> page into <a href="https://fctorial.github.io/demos/constexpr.js/output.html">this</a> page.
        <br>
        The generated page doesn't have to be completely static. In the above example, the heading is being animated
        with javascript.
    </p>

    <h4>How to use it?</h4>

    <p>
        You will have to divide the javascript being used in your page into two groups. Runtime javascript and
        compile time javascript, and annotate all compile time script tags with <progi>constexpr</progi> attribute:
        <prog>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>constexpr</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
    <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/generate_page.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        </prog><br>
        Runtime code must not depend on the compile time code, since that code will be stripped out before writing the output file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the HTML generation code has finished rendering, it must call the <progi>window._ConstexprJS_.compile()</progi>
        function. This function is injected into the page by the compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
        The compiler can be installed like this: <prog><span>npm</span> i -g constexpr.js</prog><br>

        Command line usage:
        <prog>constexpr.js --input<span>=</span><span>"&lt;input_directory&gt;"</span> --output<span>=</span><span>"&lt;output_directory&gt;"</span> <span>[</span>--exclusions<span>=</span>path1:path2<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--verbose<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--jobs<span>=</span>n<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--noheadless<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--jobtimeout<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--depfile<span>=</span><span>&amp;</span>depfile<span>&gt;</span><span>]</span></prog><br>

        A json object with the command line args, compilation results and dependencies will be written to the path specified by <progi>--depfile</progi> option.
        <br>
        The tool also copies resources (<progi>css</progi>, <progi>images</progi> etcetra)
        that are requested by pages being rendered. HTML files/resources inside paths given in <progi>--exclusions</progi> are not processed/copied.
    </p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>
            You can use any web development technology (and any number of technologies) to generate the html without any fear
            of bloat. Just make sure that <progi>window._ConstexprJS_.compile()</progi> is called <span>after</span>
            the page has finished rendering.

            This page also uses prism.js for syntax highlighting.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can mark tags other than <progi>script</progi> with <progi>constexpr</progi> as well.
            In the above example, the box at the top is marked constexpr, so it isn't present in the output page.
            This can be used to differentiate original website from generated website:
            <prog>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span> <span>constexpr</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
<span>body</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
            </prog>
        </li>
        <li>
            Client code in the page can signal the compiler to skip the current file by calling <progi>window._ConstexprJS_.abort(message)</progi>.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the original webpage, you'll see a console error when the code tries to call the compilation trigger function,
            since that function is injected by the compiler. You can add this snippet near the top to fix that error:

            <prog>
<span>&lt;</span>script constexpr<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>window<span>.</span>_ConstexprJS_<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <li>
            There might be multiple rendering tasks running in your page. You can manage all those tasks using <a href="https://github.com/fctorial/fctorial.github.io.src/blob/master/static/js/constexpr/index.js">this</a>
            refcounting mechanism.

            All the tasks will call <progi>startLoading()</progi> when they begin loading, and <progi>endLoading()</progi>
            when they've finished loading. The compilation will be triggered when all the tasks have finished.
        </li>
        <li>
            You should keep all list data separate from the html in <a href="https://github.com/fctorial/fctorial.github.io.src/tree/master/collections">json files</a>.
            <progi>constexpr</progi> code in the html will fetch these json files and render the page using them.
            The directory containing this data should be excluded using <progi>--exclusions</progi> flag, so that the
            resources inside it aren't copied over.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can include dev utilites like <a href="https://github.com/fctorial/fctorial.github.io.src/blob/master/static/js/constexpr/nav.js#L19">this</a> in the
            original website. It reloads the page whenever it's focused. It won't be in the output since it's used as constexpr.
        </li>
        <li>
            This whole website is rendered using javascript and constexpr.js. Nothing other than the demo uses runtime javascript:

<p>The aim of the following draft is to offer some thoughts on a local name from thirteenth-century Lincolnshire, <i>Macamathehou</i>, that involves a version of the Arabic name Muhammad (Middle English <i>Makomet/Macamethe</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet</i>). Whilst it has been plausibly seen as an instance of a variant of the name of Muhammed being used to mean 'heathen', 'pagan idol' or similar (based on the false but common medieval Christian belief that the prophet Muhammad was worshipped as a god), here in reference to a barrow that was considered to be a pre-Christian site, it is worth noting that there are a small number of people with names and surnames derived from Arabic <i>Muḥammad</i> apparently living in twelfth- to fourteenth-century England.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ER6e7-JsI/X7AZDfw1bCI/AAAAAAADLhw/ULvdpDuWKwAelDOKu23y5ZJFgTBdhTdMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s879/macamathehou-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="355" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhv-Lu79n_o/X7AZDcDbe6I/AAAAAAADLhs/RS2oeTJ3IocU1SGmohUZdB7Q-nFhCH-sgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/macamathehou-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Figure 1: the location of Macamathehou between Spridlington and Faldingworth parishes in Lincolnshire; click the image or <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ER6e7-JsI/X7AZDfw1bCI/AAAAAAADLhw/ULvdpDuWKwAelDOKu23y5ZJFgTBdhTdMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s879/macamathehou-large.jpg">here</a> for a larger version (image: C. R. Green/OpenStreetMap and its contributors).</i><i>&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The existence of the intriguing local name <i>Macamathehou</i> in the parish of Spridlington, Lincolnshire, was first noted in 2001 by Kenneth Cameron, John Field and John Insley in <i>Place-Names of Lincolnshire VI </i>(<i>PNL</i>), with both attestations of the name dating from the thirteenth century (the reign of King Henry III, 1216–72).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn1">1</a>) They identify the two elements of the name as being Old Norse <i>haugr</i>, 'mound, barrow', and Middle English <i>Makomet/Macamethe</i>, which derives from the name of the prophet Muhammad (Medieval Latin <i>Machometus/Mahumetus</i>, Anglo-Norman <i>Mahumet/Mahomet/Machomete</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet</i> &lt; Arabic <i>Muḥammad</i>, probably via an Arabic regional form <i>Maḥammad</i>).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn2">2</a>) Needless to say, this solution is most intriguing and has, moreover, found favour with other place-name specialist, including the <i>Vocabulary of English Place-Names </i>(<i>VEPN</i>) and Richard Coates.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><p>As to the import of this name, the easiest conclusion—and the one endorsed by&nbsp;<i>PNL</i>, <i>VEPN</i>&nbsp;and Coates—is that the first element, <i>Macamethe/</i><i>Maumate</i> etc, is not functioning simply as a normal Middle English rendering of the name Muhammad/<i>Mahomet</i>, but rather as a word indicative of heathen or pagan idolatry, based on the false but common medieval Christian belief that the prophet Muhammad was worshipped as a god. So, <i>PNL </i>describes the name as meaning 'the heathen mound', with the first element being 'a corrupt ME [Middle English] form of the name of the prophet Mohammed, for which <i>v.</i>&nbsp;MED [<i>Middle English Dictionary</i>], s.v. <i>Makomete</i>, also used to denote a pagan god or an idol'.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn4">4</a>) This is taken up by Richard Coates, who says that it has been suggested, 'with great plausibility', that <i>Macamathehou </i>in Spridlington parish 'is a Middle English name meaning "Mahomet mound", i.e. "heathen mound"', and points to 'the repeated compound of OE <i>hæðen </i>+ <i>byrgels "</i>heathen burial"' as a potential comparison.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn5">5</a>) Likewise, the <i>VEPN</i>'s draft section on M includes the following discussion:</p>

<blockquote><b>makomet </b>ME, 'idol, pagan god', an application of the name of the Arab prophet Mohammed (commonly though mistakenly believed by medieval Christians to have been worshipped as a god)... It occurs early in
<i>Macamathehou </i>(f.n.) 1216–72 L:6·211 (<b>haugr</b>), presumably to be
interpreted as 'heathen mound'.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn6">6</a>)</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, this interpretation is probably the safest option. There are certainly a handful of references to 'heathen' barrows in Old English charter bounds, for example <i>of leofwynne mearce to þam hæþenan beorge</i>, 'from Leofwine's boundary to the heathen barrow', in the charter S956 relating to Drayton, Hampshire, and dated AD 1019, although none are recorded from Lincolnshire.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn7">7</a>) It has also been suggested that the Lincolnshire names Bloater Hill (North Willingham) and Blod Hou (Barrow-on-Humber) derive from Old Norse <i>blóthaugr</i>, 'a sacrificial mound', whilst other names involving <i>haugr</i> certainly refer to supernatural/demonic creatures—for example, <i>Gasthehowe</i>/<i>Gastehowe</i>, Ashby Puerorum (Lincolnshire), recorded in the thirteenth century and deriving from Middle English <i>gast</i>/Old English <i>gāst</i>, 'ghost, dead-spirit', or names like Scratters (<i>Scrathou</i>, in Hayton, East Riding of Yorkshire) and Scrathowes (<i>Scrathou</i>, in Osmotherley, North Riding of Yorkshire), which derive from Old Norse <i>skratti</i>, 'devil, wizard'&nbsp;+ <i>haugr</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn8">8</a>) Furthermore, the Old English compound <i>hæðen&nbsp;</i>+ <i>byrgels</i>, 'heathen burial', does indeed recur frequently in Late Saxon charter bounds, with these names often said to be identifiable with barrows in the landscape.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn9">9</a>)</p><p>On the other hand, there are some possible issues with this explanation, and other interpretations are possible of Spridlington's <i>Macamathehou</i>. First, the comparison with the many instances of the OE compound <i>hæðen </i>+ <i>byrgels</i>, ‘heathen burial’, is perhaps not as convincing as it might seem. Not only is a link between this term and barrows only demonstrable in a handful of instances, but Andrew Reynolds has also suggested that the sense of the term was primarily not ‘pagan’, but rather ‘unconsecrated’, and that it denoted burials of executed offenders and other social outcasts, which renders the proposed value of these names as support for interpreting <i>Macamathehou&nbsp; </i>as meaning ‘heathen mound’ open to significant debate.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn10">10</a>) Second, if the above is correct, then this would be the only known instance of a derivative of the Arabic name Muhammad being used in a place-name to indicate a 'heathen mound' or similar, which is potentially concerning—the other elements noted above all recur in multiple names. Third, the element identified by <i>PNL </i>and <i>VEPN</i> as being present in <i>Macamethehou</i> is Middle English <i>Makomet(e)</i>. The <i>Middle English Dictionary</i> (<i>MED</i>) on <i>Makomet(e)/</i><i>Macamethe</i> etc, however, makes it clear that the primary use of this word in Middle English is as a form of the name Muhammad, not as a word referring to an 'idol'/'pagan god', with the vast majority of quotations provided by the <i>MED </i>referring either the prophet Muhammad or people named Muhammad; the only exceptions are a single quotation from Layamon's <i>Brut </i>(<i>c.</i>&nbsp;1200, <i>mahimet</i>, lacking the <i>-c-</i>), and three from two later texts.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn11">11</a>) The form of the name Muhammad that <i>was </i>primarily—although not exclusively—used in the sense 'pagan deity, idol', is rather <i>Maumet/Maumate</i>, mentioned above, deriving from Anglo-Norman <i>Maumet</i>, a reduced form of <i>Mauhoumet</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet/Mahommet</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn12">12</a>)</p>
<p>In this light, it is worth considering whether it is possible that the name <i>Macamathehou</i> could somehow be named from a person named <i>Makomet</i>/Muhammad or similar living in medieval England. Certainly, it should be noted that multiple local names relating to mounds/barrows do seem to be named after people who owned estates or land in the area. For example, Andrew Reynolds draws attention to the bounds of a mid-tenth-century charter for Swallowcliffe, Wiltshire (S468), that records the burial site of a seventh‐century woman whose grave had been cut into an existing mound as <i>Posses hlaew</i>, noting that 'Poss is a male name, and thus the mound is apparently not named after its Anglo‐Saxon occupant', implying that it was instead named after a later estate owner.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn13">13</a>) As Irene Bower long ago pointed out, such a situation can be credibly paralleled in Lincolnshire, with a number of Lincolnshire names involving <i>haugr</i> seeming to contain the same personal-name as is found in the same or a neighbouring parish-name—so, <i>Scalehau </i>(<i>Skalli </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was located near to Scawby (<i>Skalli</i>&nbsp;+ <i>bȳ</i>), with Kenneth Cameron commenting that the two were 'no doubt named from the same man'; <i>Leggeshou</i> (<i>Leggr </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was located on the boundary of Legsby parish (<i>Leggr&nbsp;</i>+ <i>bȳ</i>); <i>Katehou/Catehowe </i>(<i>Kati</i>&nbsp;+ <i>haugr</i>) was located in South Cadeby (<i>Kati&nbsp;</i>+ <i>bȳ</i>); and a <i>Grimaldeshawe</i> (<i>Grimaldi </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was recorded in the neighbouring parish to Grimoldby (<i>Grimaldi</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>bȳ</i>), perhaps on the boundary between the two.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn14">14</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nu02Jqw5h14/X7WB-D0A8sI/AAAAAAADLvg/p_vwSAkF6RQX5KkB8XMvM6WiC4a1eyI5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1296/PipeRoll-Mahumet1160-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="216" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VAcqNuGj78U/X7WB-YLMzBI/AAAAAAADLvk/_TLGpi35Olg-dWNhgmcuMcZSaz-qhCgdACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/PipeRoll-Mahumet1160-1-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Figure 2: Section from the Pipe Roll Society publication of&nbsp;The Great Roll of the Pipe for the Seventh Year of the Reign of King Henry the Second, A.D. 1160–1161 (London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1885), p. 10, dealing with Mahumet of Wiltshire (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/piperollsociety04pipeuoft/page/10/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As to the likelihood of someone named Muhammad or one of its Anglo-Norman/Middle English variants (<i>Mahumet</i>,<i> Makomet</i> and similar) actually living in medieval England, this is perhaps less far-fetched than might be assumed. Katharine Keats-Rohan and John Moore have directed attention to the Wiltshire entries of five consecutive Pipe Rolls of Henry II (1160/61–1164/65) that refer to a man named <i>Mahumet, </i>whose name-form Moore considers very difficult to explain as anything other than a rendering of Muhammad and which is accepted as such by the <i>OED </i>and <i>MED</i>. This <i>Mahumet </i>is recorded in the Pipe Rolls only because he was fined for his part in an unlicensed duel with a John de Merleberge, probably in or near Marlborough Castle, and it seems he was not an especially wealthy man, as he was pardoned the last mark of his fine due to his poverty.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn15">15</a>) Furthermore, <i>Mahumet</i> of Wiltshire was not the only man with this name for whom we have evidence from medieval England. For example, a Theobald <i>filius Mahumet</i> (or <i>filius Mahomet</i>) is recorded from early thirteenth-century Hampshire in the Pipe Rolls of Henry III for 1222–24; another man named <i>Mahomet </i>is recorded in 1327, when Edward III issued him and six others a pardon at Newton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire, for 'offenses in Ireland'; and a <i>Mahummet Saraceno</i>&nbsp;occurs in the Close Rolls of Henry III for 1254. Furthermore, a number of people surnamed <i>Mahumet </i>and similar are recorded in documents of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, for example a Humphrey Mahumet in a charter of Southwick Priory, Hampshire, a Herbert Maumet who was sergeant of Portsmouth in the mid-thirteenth century, and a Radulphus Maumet who is recorded in the reign of King John.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn16">16</a>) Moore also notes the presence of someone bearing another 'apparent Arab name' in twelfth-century Hampshire, a certain <i>Paucamatus</i>, a name that he considers to probably reflect <i>Bakmat</i>, who is recorded in Winchester from 1159/60 until 1183/4 and who is associated with …</p></div></div>

<p><span>I</span>n Beijing’s southwestern outskirts, past a four-lane overpass with sidewalks as wide as the streets themselves, is Zhengyang Road. It has the usual banks, small convenience stores, and noodle houses of many areas in the capital, but it is set apart by a row of about a dozen shops all selling the same thing — tiny electric cars. The cars look, variously, like small Range Rovers, golf carts, trolley cars, or rickshaws with sheet-iron sides, and they are slow. Their fundamental attraction is their price — between $600 and $2,500 — and that drivers can charge them the same way they would a cell phone. They also come with the perks of being loosely regulated. These low-speed electric cars, nicknamed “elderly transport vehicles,” have an enormous market, made up mostly of people who earn very little. And in China, there are a lot of them — <a href="http://english.www.gov.cn/premier/news/202005/29/content_WS5ed058d2c6d0b3f0e9498f21.html">more than 40%</a> of the population, or some 600 million people, make around $150 per month.</p>



<p>On a Sunday afternoon in October, Zhengyang Road is filled with potential customers chatting with store owners.<strong> </strong>Outside a shop with a worn sign, a young couple with a child are in the midst of a heated conversation.<strong> </strong>They came on an electric scooter and are debating whether to leave with a tiny car.</p>



<p>“Don’t we need one for school pickups?” the woman argues. “The children won’t have to put up with the cold in winter.” Her scooter offers no protection from the weather other than oven-mitt-like gloves secured to its handlebars. Her husband counters, “The 1,000 renminbi [$150] quote was for normal batteries, but lithium ones can be five times that. Can’t you just add a windshield to your scooter instead?” The shop owner shows them a cheaper model — which is cheaper because it has no roof. He suggests putting a plastic covering on top.</p>

<p>Having decided that the future of mobility is electric,<strong> </strong>the Chinese government has subsidized sales of regular electric cars since 2010. With <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/394229/plugin-electric-car-sales-china-2019/">close to 1.18 million sold</a> in 2019, China accounts for just over half of electric-vehicle sales globally. Bill Russo, founder and CEO of advisory firm Automobility Limited, sees a “steady and solid rise” in China’s electric-vehicle sales generally. The country has set a top-down target for electric vehicles to <a href="http://energy.mit.edu/news/chinas-transition-to-electric-vehicles/">make up 40%</a> of car sales by 2030, and Russo thinks they’ll have no problem hitting this goal. Tiny cars,<strong> </strong>which first began appearing in the early 2010s,<strong> </strong>have more than double the sales of regular electric cars but have<strong> </strong>never benefited from subsidies. Nor do advertisements for them air on television — instead, they appear on Kuaishou, a short-video platform popular with people living outside China’s big cities. Alongside streamers selling plums by the thousands, and others telling viewers what long-haul trucker life is like, drivers show off their tiny cars. Su Hua, Kuaishou’s founder, has long maintained that his app’s users are not “cool,” unlike those on Douyin, the TikTok predecessor popular with China’s urban elite. Rather, they are ordinary — the kind of people who might be in the market for miniature cars.</p>



<p>As they don’t technically require licenses, tiny cars tend to be popular with migrant workers, who struggle to pay for driving lessons and other car-related costs. The elderly, too, find tiny cars attractive since, up until October of last year, people over 70 could not apply for a driving license in China. They’re also convenient for anybody who wants a car to pick up groceries or their kids from school: No tiny car is longer than 1.5 meters, and their speed tops out at between 40 and 56 kilometers an hour. They’re for the short trips of daily life, not for traveling from one side of the city to another.</p>



<p>Some cities have banned sales of tiny cars — Beijing did so in 2018. Their production isn’t regulated by the government, and since they can’t be insured in many parts of China, it can be difficult for other drivers to get a payout if a tiny car is involved in an accident. Because tiny-car drivers don’t need to take a driving test, other drivers complain, they often go the wrong way and weave in and out of traffic. But since enforcement is lax, sales have quietly resumed in Beijing over the past two years. These little electric cars now exist in a kind of regulatory gray zone.</p>

      <figcaption>Tiny cars come in a variety of styles and cost between $600 and $2,500.</figcaption>

<p><strong>One of the</strong> smaller shops on Zhengyang Road is officially known as Xinlei Scooters, its name emblazoned in white characters on a large red sign above its doors. But inside, past rows of electric scooters, is a smaller, flimsier plaque above the counter announcing its other name: Shitou Cars. This subterfuge is necessary because the police could shut down the operation and confiscate its vehicles if the owners were caught selling tiny cars. Yet because enforcement hasn’t been strict of late, attempts at being covert go only so far: There are several tiny cars parked outside, an open-air showroom.</p>



<p>Xinlei/Shitou’s owner is a middle-aged man with pronounced cheekbones wearing a black tracksuit. He is more attentive to the phone calls he’s constantly receiving than the customers in the shop. It is his wife, with dyed-dark-brown hair and a pink coat, who maintains the sales patter: “I taught an auntie who had never driven a car before. She got the hang of it in three days.” She shows the cars outside to potential customers, opening their doors, instructing people to sit inside, and rolling down the windows. When two old men come in for repair services, her husband finally gets off the phone to deal with them. Meanwhile, two government functionaries in black uniforms pace down the street. They tell one owner to make his storefront tidier, but otherwise overlook the illicit operation.</p>



<p>Part of the reason why tiny cars are so popular is because there has not been an official decision on whether they need license plates. For regular cars, unfettered access to Beijing’s inner city — anywhere within the fifth ring road — is restricted to cars with Beijing plates. Licenses for gas cars are distributed through a special system so competitive that it has generated its own black market. License-plate holders can collect up to $2,700 a year by renting them to those who want to drive in the city. In addition to government subsidies, getting around some of the more onerous aspects of the licensing system is one of the main selling points for regular electric cars.</p>



<p>With Beijing temperatures reaching lows of 4 degrees Celsius in wintertime, Xinlei/Shitou has been selling,<strong> </strong>on average, two of its four-wheeled fully enclosed models every day, a saleswoman boasts. Younger couples prefer four wheels, she adds, while older people usually want three. When asked about the possibility of a tiny car being confiscated, she draws in a breath. “Don’t go on the main roads. Don’t make a business out of it,” she advises.</p>



<p>At least one of Zhengyang Road’s customers isn’t listening: Guo Caiying, who works primarily in the construction-supply industry,<strong> </strong>chauffeurs Fengtai residents around her district. She has a sticker on her tiny car’s back window with the phone number of her car dealer. Guo’s car looks like a golf cart, with cushioned brown seats enclosed by windows. A red <em>fudai</em>, a lucky charm, swings from the ceiling, its characters spelling out “peace.” There is enough space for two people to comfortably sit upright but not enough to extend your legs without hitting the plexiglass divider between driver and passenger. The car tops out at 40 kilometers an hour, and<strong> </strong>as a result, Guo never ventures beyond Fengtai — a borderland where urban and rural meet.</p>



<p>Guo wears the uniform of the countryside: a padded jacket. She is from Henan, a province 800 kilometers southwest of Beijing, and speaks its dialect. Guo starts taking calls from her regulars around 7 a.m., arriving at their door whenever they want to be picked up. She stops driving at 9 a.m., when the traffic police begin work. She characterizes her customers as “people with money who sit in offices.” Once, while in the middle of a trip, Guo saw a cop stop a car like hers. She kept driving, but dropped her passenger off before their destination. Now, if a customer calls her after 9:00, she sends her husband to pick them up with his electric scooter. He charges 75 cents (5RMB), which is half her price. Guo’s flat rate was fixed by the tiny-cab drivers who preceded her.</p>



<p>The economy of tiny cars depends on such informal practices.<strong> </strong>When asked whether she would consider undercutting other drivers, Guo is adamant. “No one can break the rules,” she says. There are local WeChat groups for tiny-car drivers that new owners are inducted into upon purchasing one. Within these groups, members swap information on the whereabouts of local cops and whether anyone has been fined or had their car taken away.</p>



<p>Despite the risks, Guo still thinks it’s worth being a tiny-car driver to make a little pocket money.<strong> </strong>Tiny cars are part of a last-mile economy that flourishes at the beginning and end of the workday. Many Fengtai residents are employed at the local high-tech park, which is host to thousands of businesses. It takes 20 minutes to walk from one end of the park to the other, a trip many would rather make by tiny car. The cars’ main competitors are share bikes, which are cheaper but lack space for luggage and can’t be split with a friend. Tiny cars are also more social — a feature Guo tries to …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>During late 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS Lite had a leftover feature in its SoC allowing it to easily have cheap hardware video output. With a little circuitry and some software hacks, we were able to restore it and make it usable for anyone. No FPGA’s, no bulky or cumbersome hardware. This mod is specially useful to revive consoles with only the lower screen, being able to watch the upper screen on your TV. Or to create a GBA Macro with additional TV Output.</p>

<center>
  <b>First iteration of the TV-OUT board in action</b>
  </center>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>If you are just interested in installation, this is the current method <strong>while we work on simpler methods</strong> and more features you have requested:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://ezflash.sosuke.com/wiki/index.php/Flashme">flashME CFW</a> (Custom FirmWare) on your DS Lite</li>
  <li>Connect the Nintendo DS Lite’s upper screen flex to the PCB board.</li>
  <li>Donwload the “NDS TV OUT ENABLE.nds” homebrew from the <a href="https://github.com/LostNintendoHistory/Lost-NDS-TV">NDS TV OUT repo</a></li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases">Twilight Menu</a></li>
  <li>Copy both the NDS TV OUT ENABLE and Twilight Menu .nds files to a flashcart.</li>
  <li>Use flashme to autoboot into the flashcart. You can do this by pressing A + B + Start + Select while booting. Run Twilight menu, and from there, run the enabler homebrew.</li>
  <li>The console will return to Twilight Menu. Now you can use the buttons on the board to swap between the different screen modes (Upper Screen to TV, Bottom Screen to TV, etc) and launch your games.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The retail firmware of the Nintendo DS Lite disables this specific feature early in the boot process. To reenable it, we use a custom firmware like flashme, which is very easy to install and is required only once, plus a homebrew. Despite that, we are working on an even simpler solution to make it available to as many people as possible, our own custom firmware which integrates patches to enable this feature directly on boot. Additionally, we are currently working with homebrew developers to integrate control of this new feature into existing software for the DS Lite.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>This feature is only found on the Nintendo DS Lite. Nintendo DS Phat does not contain this feature nor does the Nintendo DSi. It is important to remark that <strong>this is not the same hardware</strong> found on Devkits or other special units. This hardware feature is present in virtually <strong>every single Nintendo DS Lite</strong> out there. The reason why it was left there is unknown, but as said before, it is not related to development units, those use a different video capture hardware. Perhaps Nintendo imagined the Nintendo Switch as early as 2006?</p>

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/PCB_Rev_11.png" width="350" height="400"></center>

<p>We only need a few extra hardware components to make this video signal usable. You will be able to download the schematics and gerber files for our open hardware circuit board <a href="https://github.com/LostNintendoHistory/Lost-NDS-TV">from the repository</a>. The latest version is revision 1.2 which fixes some minor issues with a component in the board.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/Prototype.jpg" width="350" height="350"><br>
</center>
<center>
  <b>First prototype and tests before designing a proper board</b></center>


<p>The final, production-ready board contains a DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter) which turns the 10 bits digital signal at 16.7 MHz provided by the DS Lite into a proper analogue signal. This signal then goes through an operational amplifier and it’s ready to be delivered to your nearest TV trough composite video.</p>

<p>We are currently considering creating an additional PCB revision which would allow to install the mod on consoles without lossing a working upper screen.</p>

			<p><strong>The Bombard Story</strong> is the account of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bombard">Alain Bombard’s</a> amazing journey in 1952 across the <a href="http://greatestadventurers.com/the-north-west-passage-by-roal-amundsen/">Atlantic</a> on a small 14-foot inflatable boat. Alain Bombard left without food or fresh water and sailed 4.400 kilometers. He lost 25 kg. but proved his point: Man can actually survive on ocean water for an extended period of time!</p>

<p>As a doctor, Bombard was concerned about the hundreds of deaths at sea every year related to sailors drinking ocean water. He developed the theory that humans can not just survive but live for years on seawater. This sounds very strange, but his big idea was to begin drinking seawater, while you are still hydrated – and in small quantities. It turns out that saltwater is only dangerous if you are dehydrated and suddenly drink large amounts of it. – The way shipwrecked sailors typically would do when they run out of fresh water. From the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some time I had made a study of the resistance of the human organism to privations and had convinced myself that it was possible for an individual to survive beyond the limits normally assigned by physiological science. I had paid particular attention to the case histories of political deportees, prisoners, and undernourished populations. But, with my background as a doctor, for whom the teachings of science remain a dead letter unless they can find practical application, my theoretical studies only seemed to lead to the question: ‘What use can made of this knowledge?’</p></blockquote>
<p>Bombard ate spoonfuls of plankton that he collected in a fine net and he also drank juice made from pressed fish he caught along the way. Sound disgusting, but the man survived and he might have discovered an important piece of knowledge for survival on the ocean.</p>

<p>I had a very interesting chat with a few data science students yesterday. Part of the chat involved the idea of statistical modeling. Throughout the chat, it occured to me that the students didn’t have a very good grasp of what modeling is. To their credit, they were proficient in the techniques of linear regression, and deep learning, but I got the sense that they were very much pushing buttons and watching things happen rather than understanding what they were actually doing. There was no sense of a big picture view.</p>
<p>This has been happening quite a lot lately. I find it somewhat alarming. This blog post is a semi-transcript of what I said last night. It aims to be as simple as possible.</p>

<p>A model is a representation of reality. It’s what we think reality looks like.</p>
<p>For example, we live on Planet Earth, in a solar system. We can build models of our Solar System. Here’s an example of a model of our Solar System.</p>

<p>As a child, such models of our solar system endlessly fascinate. I would spend hours thinking about how the planets moved. I would play and watch the planets spin around its spindles. I understood that there was a force called gravity that caused the planets to orbit the sun. As I grew older, the physical model of our Solar System is gradually replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion">three laws</a>.</p>
<p>There are parts of the model we can study:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the shape of the orbits</li>
<li>How the planets move</li>
<li>Why do planets move thus</li>
</ul>
<p>These are sub-models of the model of our Solar System. The shape of the orbit is given by Kepler’s First Law. How planets move is given by Kepler’s Second and Third Law. Why do planets move thus is given by Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Each of Kepler’s laws have an equation governing them. So we can say the equations model our Solar System. The equations are the model of our Solar System. These equations describe something static (the shape of the orbit) and represent something dynamic (how the planets move). What used to be physical motion in a physical model can now be written down on a piece of paper, an equation representing the real thing.</p>

<p>There are many ways of making a model. Sometimes it’s useful to have a physical understanding of something. <a href="https://blog.chewxy.com/2021/01/09/sars-cov-2/">I built the 2019-SARS-CoV-2 virion</a> to help me have a better understanding of the coronavirus that caused the pandemic in 2020. Now, I’m no biologist, so my model is crude. My model is extremely physical. Despite this, it gave me an understanding of how a mRNA vaccine might work. It gave me confidence over what actual proper scientists are doing.</p>
<p>So making a physical model is one way. But what if we want something more rigorous? The usual way is to resort to some sort of formalism. Various fields have various formalisms. For example, in chemistry, you use chemical equations. However, the most common formalism would be a mathematical equation. Maths equations are used in physics, economics, biology, and many other fields.</p>
<p>So how do you create an equation that becomes a model of something? There are two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate an equation.</li>
<li>Find an equation from data.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the large scheme of things, both of these amount to the same thing: generating an equation. I’ll talk about that in a later section. For now, when I say “model generation” I mean generating an equation that models reality.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-generate-an-equation">How Do You Generate An Equation?</h2>
<p>The simplest way of generating an equation is to randomly generate one by writing down symbols on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>That’s daft, you say. You’d be hard pressed to find a equation that adequately describes the situation!</p>
<p>That’s why most model generation comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">first principles</a>. In using the Solar System example, if we accept Newton’s law of universal graviatation ($F = G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}$), then we can work our way to find Kepler’s third law. Kepler’s other laws require other first principles such as trigonometry.</p>
<p>The key is that you understand a subject well enough that you may generate further models about the subject using your basic understanding.</p>
<p>However, random generation has its place. In fact, from here on, whenever I write “generate a model”, you may think of a person randomly coming up with math equations.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-find-an-equation-from-data">How Do You Find An Equation From Data?</h2>
<p>There may be cases where first principles may not be used. This is often the case in new fields.</p>
<p>So the next best way is to find an equation from data. There are many ways to do them. Regression analysis is one such way of finding an equation from data. Let’s look at a simple example of linear regression with one variable.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea of a linear regression is that you plot your data points, and draw a straight line through the plot (line A). Each data point would be some distance away from line. Sum those distances up and square them. Call it the “error”. Now draw another line through the plot (line B) and find the errors of B. Keep doing until you find a line that has the lowest amount of errors.</p>
<p>This is the line-of-best-fit. Given that all straight lines on a plot can be described by an equation that looks like $y = mx +C$, the equation that describes the line of best fit (e.g. $y=2x + 1$) is the model.</p>
<p>This idea of model building extends all the way to deep neural networks. They key being the model is built by looking at the relationships between the variables that make up a data point.</p>

<p>The whole point of creating a model is to reflect reality. I could well come up with a model of gravity that says this: all objects exert a force on each other that is quadratic on the distance between them - written as $F = d(a, b)^2$. But does this reflect reality? No.</p>
<p>How do I know this? I know this because I can test it. I can collect data, and then check if the data fits my model. In the silly example above, it’s trivial to check with a counterpoint: I am able push something off my desk. If the force is solely based on distance, then as my hand approaches the object, the force should get smaller and smaller to the point that I am unable to affect the object.</p>
<p>In many courses about regression analyses, the R² values are often taught to students as a measure of how good one’s model is<span><span></span><span>I find this to be mostly true about "data science" courses/bootcamps, but not more traditional uni level course on regression/economics/statistics</span></span>. It’s not! A R² value is how good the fit of data to the line is. In some sense you may think of this as the inverse of “how good is your model” . It’s more “how much data fits in your model”. Indeed, the R² value is indicative of how much variance of your data is covered by the model.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the courses are wrong. The statement that “R² tells you how good your model is” is a very subtle statement. Let’s unpack them. Let’s say you found a line of best fit that is described by the formula $y = 2x + 15$. This is the model that we have “generated”. Now we want to see how much of reality (our dataset) is described by the model. It is in this sense that R² represents the notion of how “good” a model is.</p>
<p>Now it seems a bit weird, given that we used the dataset to find the line of best fit, and then we turn around and say we generated a model, not let’s test to see how good it is. There seems to be a bit of circular logic to it. However there are a lot of theoretical work on why the line of best fit found by a ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a good model “generator” - the wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares">OLS</a> covers quite a bit, as does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem">Gauss-Markov theorem</a> article. Most textbooks also lay out proofs of why OLS estimators are BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator).</p>
<p>Here I want to point out that “reality” is itself just a sample. The dataset that you use to generate a model is just a sample. This is where conscious sampling of data is important. Let’s imagine we are training a machine learning system to recognize faces. My social circle are White or Asian. So if I ask my social circle to send me some photographs of their faces to train a machine learning system, then the machine learning system would not be able to recognize faces that are not White or Asian! Clearly this is not a good representation of reality.</p>
<p>This trivial example only scratches the surface of equitable conscious collection of sample “reality” for the sake of model building. This topic is a very deep topic and it’ll take many blog posts to talk about it. So I shall leave it be for now.</p>
<p>In more advanced machine learning modeling systems (e.g: deep learning systems), it is common to split the dataset into “training” and “testing” datasets. The model is trained on the training dataset and tested on the testing dataset. This is to ensure that the model does not only model “reality” that is in the training dataset, but can also generalize to previously unseen data.</p>
<p>What I am trying to convey here is that sanity checks against reality is a good thing. We should do them more often.</p>

<p>Having said that, we have to accept that models are just that - models. They are not reality. George Box had a good saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All models are wrong. But some are useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key is to find a model that is useful enough for what you need to do. Let the natural philosophers worry about the most accurate models of reality.</p>

<p>Humanity is always generating models. Individually, in our brains, we generate internal models that are corrected every second of the day. Consider catching a ball. Your brain generates a model of physical reality - no equations here - telling us where the ball is going to be. As the ball arcs through the air, we update the models in our brain, getting better and better predictions, resulting in us catching the ball. Or in my case, the ball lands on my face.</p>
<p>Communally, we generate models too. The invention of writing and speech allowed us to share models with other individuals. We started using things like maths equations to make our meanings clear. Our …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

February 22, 2021 | https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-02-22-mypy-and-doltpy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-02-22-mypy-and-doltpy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><h2>Dolt</h2>
<p>Dolt is an SQL-database with Git-versioning.
The goal of <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/doltpy">Doltpy</a>, in
concert with <a href="http://github.com/dolthub/dolt">Dolt</a>, is to solve
reproducibility and versioning problems for data and machine
learning engineers using Python.</p>
<h2>Mypy</h2>
<p>Mypy was created by Guido van Rossum, the primary developer of the
Python language, as a way to apply
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP standards</a> to Python source
code. When lines of code are added to the Python core libraries,
their respective mypy stubs are updated lockstep.</p>
<p>So when we fix mypy errors we are enforcing rules of the Python type system.
This point is subtle but important: mypy errors when your code is not doing
what you've declared it should do. Static checking can't anticipate what
input your code will be fed at runtime, but as a developer you can write
code that is self-consistent with function and type signatures.</p>
<p>Adding type-hints without enforcement is a common anti-pattern.
Mypy is separately installed from Python and its typing modules -- it
is up to the developer to actually validate type-hints after adding them.
Code with contradictory typing documentation can mislead
developers and users alike. Mypy is that bridge between type-aesthetics
and type-correctness.</p>
<p>Mypy involves three main modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/mypy">mypy</a>: A source code parsing and
applying PEP constraints.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed">typeshed</a>: Type-stubs core and
3rd party libraries; code whose implementations are
correctness-checked when used in new code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/typing">typing</a>: Modules for compatibility
between python versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these modules are regularly used when using mypy (<code>typing</code>
less so if you only suport one Python version). One addendum is that you
can define custom type stubs in your own code, in the same manner <code>typeshed</code>
provides type stubs for popular pip packages, like
<a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/boto/boto">boto</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/requests/requests">requests</a>.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Typing inconsistency</h3>
<p>We use <code>mypy</code> in Doltpy 2.0 to help ensure code-quality. Below is an
an example from Doltpy 1.0 to demonstrate mypy in action:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> number<span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> commit<span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> OrderedDict<span>:</span>
    args <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"log"</span><span>]</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> number<span>:</span>
        args<span>.</span>extend<span>(</span><span>[</span><span>"--number"</span><span>,</span> number<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inside the <code>log</code> function signature, <code>number: int</code> correctly reflects the developer intent,
but <code>args: List[str]</code> disallows integers. This means that calling <code>Dolt.log(1)</code>
fails with an error, while <code>Dolt.log("1")</code> succeeds.</p>
<p>The intended behavior is clear, and mypy preemptively notices the inconsistency:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> python -m mypy <span>.</span>
example.py:4: error: List item <span>1</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"int"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"str"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>fixing the type inconsistency restores the expected behavior:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> number<span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> commit<span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> OrderedDict<span>:</span>
    args <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"log"</span><span>]</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> number<span>:</span>
    args<span>.</span>extend<span>(</span><span>[</span><span>"--number"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span>number<span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and makes mypy happy:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> python -m mypy <span>.</span>
Success: no issues found <span>in</span> <span>1</span> <span>source</span> <span>file</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Custom typing stub</h3>
<p>As a final example, here are first few lines for a custom type stub of the
<code>doltpy.cli.Dolt</code>
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/doltpy/blob/master/doltpy/types/dolt.py%5D">class</a>
in doltpy:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>DoltT</span><span>(</span>Generic<span>[</span>_T<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    _repo_dir<span>:</span> <span>str</span>

    <span>@abc<span>.</span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>repo_dir</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>

    <span>@staticmethod</span>
    <span>@abc<span>.</span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>repo_dir<span>:</span> Optional<span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>"Dolt"</span><span>:</span>  
        <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After defining <code>class Dolt(DoltT)</code>, mypy will enforce our interface
the same way mypy enforces standard library and other 3rd party type
stubs. As a plus, code editors like VSCode should also give hints for
function signature definitions.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post I touched on the utility of using type-hints
with mypy, and the comparative pitfalls of using type-hints without.
We used specific examples from Doltpy to highlight the nature
of static type-checking, and how we use mypy in production at Dolthub.</p>

Even a one person business could pull that off.

So the minimum order is $13.</p><p>They also charge for delivery with a reasonable price that does not feel like gouging. Also interestingly they point out:</p><blockquote>"We charge a flat $3.0 delivery fee whether you order 1 box or 100."</blockquote><p>So there is plenty of motivation for larger orders as the delivery fee feels close to free.</p><h3 id="special-sauce">Special Sauce</h3><p>If cookies delivered to your door is not enough of a differentiator, Crave also advertises that they deliver <strong>straight out of the oven</strong> and thus your cookies will <strong>arrive warm</strong>.</p><p>Can't you just about taste that?</p><p>This is a smart <em>special sauce ninja move</em>.

<p>A student asked me this as I closed out one of my Python Programming lectures in January.  In this context, the student meant “what should I use for my upcoming homework assignment,” but I didn’t realize that at first. On <em>most</em> occasions when I hear this question—usually in professional circles—the unspoken subtext is “always.” <em>Which of these two styles should I swear by as <strong>the</strong> right way to write code?</em> </p>



<p> A second later, the student clarified “…on this assignment, I mean.”</p>



<p>Too little, too late. My gears were already turning.</p>



<div><div>
<div><div>
<div><div>
<h3>This is the first in what will be a two-part series:</h3>



<ol><li><strong>Words Mean Things (this post)</strong></li><li>But actually, how do you choose what to use?</li></ol>




</div></div>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<h3>The Functional/OO debate has, in my view, two big problems.</h3>



<ol><li><strong>The “all or nothing” assumption.</strong> I have a colleague who wants all his code to be functional code, full stop. I also have two former colleagues who swear by, and I quote, “lots of little objects.” I don’t fall into either camp because I think there are better questions than “<em>which of these two tools should I use <strong>always</strong>,” </em>with more insightful answers that have more potential to make us better programmers.</li><li><strong>Absolute terminological butchery.</strong> We have these two terms: “functional” and “object-oriented”, that we use interchangeably with other would-be synonyms, except that they don’t describe the same thing. And what’s with the fact that “functional” is just “functional” and “object” has “-oriented” tacked onto the end? Why isn’t it opposite “function-oriented?” We’re <em>super</em> imprecise about the way we discuss these ideas, and then we make new programmers feel stupid because they cannot picture the leaping triple-axle we <em>obviously meant</em> to perform when what we <em>actually</em> did was slip and fall on the ice. </li></ol>

<p>This grinds my gears to nubbins: the way we teach, instruct, and describe in lazy, platitudinous, imprecise ways, and then suggest that some people just aren’t smart enough to get it. </p>



<h3>So I got angry and tried to fix it. </h3>



<p>Here’s a video explanation. The explanation references Python because I recorded it with my Python students top-of-mind. That said, Python also serves as a useful model language for discussing this topic. </p>

<p>If you don’t want to watch me scream and gesticulate while my off-kilter bowtie tragically shortens my neck for the camera, you can see a more language-agnostic version of the point I’m making here in the text below.</p>



<h3 id="So-first-of-all">So first of all</h3>






	
	


<p>Let’s talk about terminology, because there’s a massive lack of precision on this floating around the programming community, and it makes these concepts harder to understand than they have to be.</p>



<h3 id="What-is-a-Paradigm?">What is a Paradigm?</h3>



<p>Let’s talk about two different&nbsp;<strong>paradigms</strong>: different ideas about&nbsp;<strong>how</strong>&nbsp;solving a programming problem can work.</p>



<ol><li><strong>imperative</strong>: describes a way of thinking about a programming problem. Specifically, thinking about a programming problem in terms of how to perform tasks and how to manage state</li><li><strong>declarative</strong>: describes a way of thinking about a programming problem. Specifically, thinking about a programming problem in terms of what&nbsp;<em>output</em>&nbsp;we want, without having to know the details of how we got there.</li></ol>



<p>Different programming languages adopt each of these to different degrees.</p>



<p>For example, in Ruby, when you want to write a web app, you inherit from classes (usually defined by a framework like Rails or Sinatra) that are specifically designed to help you keep track of&nbsp;<em>state</em>&nbsp;(database records, attributes on objects) and&nbsp;<em>behavior</em>&nbsp;(which requests are supposed to route to what actions).</p>



<p>By comparison, in SQL, you write a statement declaring what data you want out of the database and how you want it organized. SQL decides for you how to get the thing you want—whether to use indices, what order to do things in, et cetera—without bothering you to specify that information.</p>



<h3 id="How-do-we-implement-the-paradigms?">How do we implement the paradigms?</h3>



<p><strong>Chiefly, programming languages&nbsp;<em>implement</em>&nbsp;these two paradigms with object-based implementations or function-based implementations</strong>.</p>



<ol><li><strong>object-based</strong>: describes the implementation of a solution in code. Specifically, a solution that depends on the instantiation of, use of, and inheritance from objects.</li><li><strong>function-based</strong>: describes the implementation of a solution in code. Specifically, a solution that depends on the definition of, use of, and passing of functions to functions.</li></ol>



<p>These are not the only ways to implement the paradigms. Huge, common example: SQL is largely not a functional language. You aren’t passing functions around to functions. But it does implement the declarative&nbsp;<em>paradigm</em>. The paradigms and the implementations are not equivalent things.</p>



<h3 id="What-does-&quot;oriented&quot;-mean?">What does “-oriented” mean?</h3>



<p><strong>When a programming language is&nbsp;<em>oriented</em>&nbsp;in a certain direction, it means that the constructs available in that language loan themselves better to one implementation or the other.</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>object-oriented</strong>: describes a programming language. Specifically, one whose constructs make&nbsp;<strong>object-based</strong>&nbsp;solutions convenient to implement.</li><li><strong>functionally-oriented</strong>: describes a programming language. Specifically, one whose constructs make&nbsp;<strong>function-based</strong>&nbsp;solutions convenient to implement.</li></ul>



<p>Now, it is&nbsp;<em>possible</em>&nbsp;(though kinda difficult) to make a language that&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;supports&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;type of solution. Haskell is pretty close to a&nbsp;<strong>functional</strong>&nbsp;language. Alloy is pretty close to an&nbsp;<strong>object</strong>&nbsp;language. However, the utility of a language drops off pretty fast if it&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;does one or the other because both are at least a&nbsp;<em>little</em>&nbsp;useful in most programming areas. So&nbsp;<strong>-oriented</strong>&nbsp;means “one is more convenient, but you can kinda do both.”</p>



<p>Colloquial terminology butchers this by referring to functionally oriented languages as “functional” and languages that are oriented either way as “multi paradigm” despite the fact that the&nbsp;<em>paradigm</em>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<em>idea</em>, not an&nbsp;<em>implementation</em>, that a programming language does not have a&nbsp;<em>paradigm</em>, and that a language is <em>X-oriented</em> already denotes that it supports multiple implementation strategies.</p>



<p>(I firmly believe that the reason that this functional vs. OOP idea is so hard for people is that we use the same term to mean six different things, two of which are sometimes opposites.)</p>



<p>I found this chart to provide a visual, but it&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;butchered the terminology, so I fixed it:</p>

<h3 id="Python-is-an-object-oriented-language.">Python is an object-oriented language.</h3>



<p>People will argue with me on this point that Python is “in fact, dual-paradigm.” I disagree for reasons that you are now intimately familiar with. Python is object-oriented. You&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;do functional programming in it. It is designed, however, to prioritize object-based programming. BDFL Guido Van Rossum has said this himself on several occasions (<a href="https://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html">here, straight from the horse’s mouth, don’t @ me</a>). So far the core team has not reversed any of the major technical decisions driven by that point of view. </p>



<p>I would also argue that Python is not only <em>not at all unique</em> in its support for multiple paradigms, but also <em>a far cry from the most graceful language</em> at supporting multiple paradigms. This is fine: as I mentioned, the design goals of the language have never included functional support, or even grace in general (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2021/01/31/why-learn-python/">see here, we talked about this</a>). But like, when people get on a high horse about this, please don’t be taken in.</p>



<h3>Fine, Chelsea. Anyway, which one should I use?</h3>



<p>Functional programming.</p>



<p>I’m kidding: based on the fact that we just spent a thousand words getting clear on what we’re even <em>talking</em> about, you’d be right to predict that my answer to this question has a lot more nuance than that. Meanwhile, though, I try to keep things pithy and digestible around here. So we’ll call it a night and dig into the “what to use” question in the next post.</p>

I felt like it was time for me to move beyond protesting and get involved, somehow, in creating change. That was why I joined an ad hoc committee formed by our city council to address police policy. Think global, act local. At last, I felt hope. I felt like maybe I can make a difference that matters. And then I faced reality, and was shocked by how bad it is.</p><p id="9857">I was not naïve going into this. I fully expected that whatever good policy change our committee was able to craft might be diluted or rejected by the city council in the end, or that the Police Chief might find ways to circumvent them, or that even if enacted, the police union would still allow officers who violate those policies to be exonerated. With that in mind, I stayed focused on the long haul. I wanted to craft strong and demanding policies that could become part of a list of demands to be relentlessly rallied before the city officials until they are adopted. I kept my eye on forming alliances with others on the committee that could grow into lasting coalitions. This committee, to me, was only the beginning.</p><p id="8c03">It looked promising. The city had called on 13 civic organizations representing BIPOC and other marginalized communities. I was there on behalf of a nonprofit that services transgender and gender non-conforming folx. There are 30 members, in all. As we went through brief introductions at the first meeting, I was encouraged. The committee is facilitated by a team of three individuals, including a Black woman who is the Equity &amp; Access Coordinator for the county. She and I conversed at the outset about the challenges of facilitating a group the size of ours over Zoom due to the pandemic. We talked about setting group agreements. We talked about equity over equality and elevating voices that were underprivileged, especially those of women of color. I mentioned the need to give each member enough of a platform to feel seen and recognized at the beginning, even though that would be a big time investment, because it would save time in the long run by deterring potential internal conflicts. I also expressed my opinion that we would need to work in smaller subcommittees in order to be effective.</p><h2 id="b7ce">Thwarted by the System</h2><p id="ff5a">But then we ran into two great obstacles; public meetings law and Robert’s Rules of Order. The first curtailed our ability to network and converse with each other on the committee. The second is an infuriating silencer that obstructs everything I have come to learn about good problem-solving and decision-making. I’ll start with public records law because that is more straightforward. The law states that we must have a quorum, in our case 16 or more, of members present at each meeting. Each meeting must be posted and publicly broadcast in real time. Since we were airing our meeting over Zoom due to the pandemic, the meetings are live streamed and recorded. But because the live stream and recording do not show the chat box, we cannot use that feature to communicate things like consent with what the active speaker is saying, or to ask clarifying questions. It all has to be voiced to be recorded. Furthermore, since only the Zoom hosts can see non-verbal signs, we cannot use the raised hands nor the Yes/No functions built into Zoom. Instead we have to wait the three to four minutes it takes for the host to read off each of the 30 names, wait for the person to unmute, and get a recorded response with a “yes”, “no”, or “abstain” for every motion we attempt to pass. We have yet to do this without someone in the middle asking for the motion to be restated. I don’t think there is anyone involved who is not finding this irritating, but everyone seems resigned to endure it.</p><p id="7e09">The worst aspect of the way the city is interpreting public records law is that they have instructed all of us not to communicate with each other as a group outside of the public meetings. Email correspondence, file sharing, and social media can all become violations of public records law. If there are 16 or more of us involved, or even if there is not a quorum but we are discussing content that affects decision-making, it all needs to be publicly broadcast. While I can understand the reasoning behind these stipulations, where does that leave us? We are 30 members of very diverse parts of our city, we don’t know each other very well, and many of us have never served on a committee like this before. How are we supposed to work together? We have been reduced, effectively, to responding in the moment. We cannot even use file sharing to look at and consider ideas or share resources except by going through the facilitation team.</p><p id="ed4b">The facilitation team has directed us to send all communication to them and they will disperse information to the committee. That would be fine, if it were simply a procedure to go through. But the facilitation team does not simply pass along information. They hold onto it, decide whether or not it is information that should or should not be shared, sometimes rewrite or re-position it, and pack everything into one overwhelming information packet that we receive on Friday night before a Monday meeting. One reason behind this is that all the documentation must also be publicly posted alongside the meeting announcement. It also consolidates things so that committee members do not get bogged down with frequent emails. The danger is in editing out or misconstruing some of our voices, often those that most need to be heard. Also, there is the disabling effect of leaving us inactive and unable to work productively in the two weeks between meetings. I find myself struggling to resist the idea that the facilitation team has an expected outcome for us, and they are guiding the committee to meet their expectations.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="A laptop computer showing a large group of faces of people conferencing on a Zoom call.

For those who are not familiar, this is a set of meeting protocols that dates back to before the Civil War. Basically, the facilitator calls on people to speak, one at a time, without interruptions for a given amount of time. In our meetings it is 3 minutes. When someone wants to propose a decision, they make a “motion”. Someone else must second that motion. Then the facilitator calls the vote. The motion, the person who presented it, the person who seconded it and the total numbers of votes: yes, no, and abstain, are all recorded. That’s it in a nutshell.</p><p id="9cee">What is missing from Robert’s Rules of Order is the magic of good problem-solving. There is no room for contained chaos, a free flow of energy, voices, and ideas. I taught engineering design in high schools for ten years. One of the most enjoyable, and innovatively genius, aspects of problem-solving is brainstorming. Brainstorming is meant to be messy. It’s a chance to air everything out and look at it from as many different angles as you can dream up. You start to notice patterns and connections. Someone poses something “crazy” and it piques your interest. Then there is this very important concept called “piling on.” Piling on happens when your idea sparks a new idea in my mind. I share my idea and that, in turn, sparks a new idea for someone else. This phase of problem-solving is divergent and for traditionalists, it goes against every fiber in their “we need to narrow this down” trajectory. But the traditional “narrowing down” linear approach leads to very limited and narrow solutions. Whereas, the creativity and mutual discovery of the brainstorming process culminates in a kind of magical synthesis of ideas and approaches. The team then needs to choose what approach they want to take. It might be evident in a general idea that rises up out of the chaos in a way that is unifying and electrifying, which leads to a much smoother process as you narrow in on the solution. Or you may see two or three different approaches that you either need to choose between as a group, or make a choice to split up and try all of them. Besides being a good way to get fresh and, at times, brilliant ideas, brainstorming also results in better teamwork because everyone was able to contribute fully and feel seen, heard, and involved.</p><p id="5d12">But the public meeting format has no room for that. We can’t even utilize Zoom break-out groups because the public would need to see all of the break-out groups simultaneously. Here is where it becomes de-humanizing to me. There is no place to <em>form</em> ideas in the public meeting. Members are expected to <em>bring</em> ideas, pre-fabricated, and see how they hold up to a vote. I used to function like that, bringing my ideas to the table in a battle for the best articulated argument to slay all others and take the lead. Then I studied feminism. When you value the people and the process, everything changes. It’s no longer a contest to see who has the best idea. It becomes about the whole, all of us together as a group, facing a problem and learning from each other as we go. I don’t want to presume to bring a solution that will address everyone’s needs. I want to hear from others and I want my thoughts to be affected by those stories. I want our collective ideas to <em>become</em> as we meet. What if our government were like that? What if the premise was that no one has the answer going in, but if we all bring our perspectives together and listen to one another, the answer will take form out of the collective whole? I know. It sounds ludicrous given the extreme partisan attacks that happen all the time in our current system. But once you have experienced this kind of collective solution-making even on a small scale; it can make you a believer.</p><h2 id="778c">White Supremacy Playbook</h2><p id="1307">Robert’s Rules of Order and the general meeting protocols really do fall right in line with what we know about white supremacist culture. What I mean by this is that we value this methodology and purport …</p></div></div></section></div>

<p>Last Saturday 2021-02-20 at 11:46:42 UTC <a href="https://destevez.net/tag/tianwen/">Tianwen-1</a> passed the periapsis of its elliptical polar orbit at Mars and made a retrograde burn to reduce its apoapsis radius. The  trajectory planning of the spacecraft can be seen in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianwen-1">Wikipedia page</a>: the spacecraft first arrived into a low inclination elliptical orbit by making a <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1359433349018882050">Mars orbit insertion</a> at periapsis, then coasted to apoapsis, where it performed a <a href="https://destevez.net/2021/02/tianwen-1-plane-change-planning/">plane change</a>, and then it arrived at periapsis, performing the manoeuvre described in this post.</p>



<p>Over the next few days the spacecraft should move into a reconnaissance orbit, which is given in Wikipedia to be a 265 x 60000 km orbit (having a period of 2 days) with an inclination of 86.9 degrees. However, the last burn hasn’t lowered the apoapsis that much. The current orbit is approximately 280 x 84600 km (3.45 day period) with an inclination of 87.7 degrees. A possible reason for using the current orbit, which has been described as a phasing orbit, will be explained in this post after reviewing the data we have about the burn.</p>



<p>As I usually do, to compute the moment and delta-V of the burn I propagate the pre-burn and post-burn trajectories in <a href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/docs/">GMAT</a> using <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Tianwen/orbit/phasing_burn_vectors.script">this script</a>, and study the output in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Tianwen/Tianwen-1%20phasing%20burn.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>. I obtain an intersection at 11:44:18 UTC, which is pretty close to the periapsis passage, so the data seems correct.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trajectories_intersection.png"><img width="644" height="341" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trajectories_intersection-644x341.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trajectories_intersection-644x341.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trajectories_intersection-300x159.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trajectories_intersection.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The delta-V vector in m/s using the Mars body inertial frame described in <a href="https://destevez.net/2021/02/tianwen-1-mars-centric-state-vectors/" data-type="post" data-id="9635">this post</a> is</p>



<pre>[-1.477, -1.912, 52.565]</pre>



<p>This vector has a magnitude of 52.62 m/s. Assuming a dry mass of 2500 kg and fuel mass of 950 kg, this burn would have taken 60 seconds with the 3 kN thrusters, and spent 57 kg of fuel. Thus, according to our (somewhat crude) fuel estimates, approximately 900 kg of fuel remain now.</p>



<p>It is convenient to write the delta-V vector in the VNB frame whose axes are given by V, the velocity vector, N, the vector normal to the orbit (which is defined to point along the cross product of the radius and V), and B, the bi-normal vector, which is the cross product of V and N. The VNB coordinates in m/s are</p>



<pre>[-50.406,  0.032,  15.104]</pre>



<p>We see that most of the burn happens along -V as expected for a retrograde burn, but there is a significant component along +B. This is perhaps a bit unexpected. The effect of a +B burn is to move the periapsis backwards along the orbit, so that it would move to a slightly more northern latitude (the spacecraft descends from north to south on the periapsis passage). In fact, the periapsis has moved from a latitude of 10.03º N to a latitude of 10.25º N. This might be relevant for the discussion that comes below.</p>



<p>Now the good question is what is the reason for moving to this intermediate phasing orbit with a 3.45 day period instead of moving directly to the 2 day period orbit? I think there is a quite reasonable explanation, but we must first understand the purpose of the 2 day period reconnaissance orbit. This will be the orbit used by the spacecraft to map and survey the intended landing site, until the lander is released, which is expected to happen in May or June.</p>



<p>Therefore, it seems quite desirable to have an orbit whose periapsis ground track always passes over the landing site. This gives plenty of opportunities for gathering survey data and is also mandatory for the release of the lander, which is basically going to be done from the reconnaissance orbit (by first lowering its periapsis in a suitable manner). So all this makes me think that the quoted “2 day period” is actually 2 Mars sidereal days (a Mars sidereal day is 24 hours, 37 minutes and 22 seconds), since that would give a repeating ground track.</p>



<p>For this plan to work well, the periapsis of the the orbit needs to be at the correct longitude by the time that the 2 sidereal day orbit is entered. Otherwise the ground track will be repeating, but it will not pass over the landing site. Now, the longitude of the next periapsis of the current orbit turns out to be 111.3º E. In Wikipedia the coordinates of the intended landing site in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Planitia">Utopia Planitia</a> are given as 24.748º N, 110.318º E. Note that the latitude of the site is somewhat higher than the latitude of the periapsis of the current orbit, so perhaps moving the periapsis north is desirable. This might (but only might) be the reason for the burn component along B.</p>



<p>So we see that around the next periapsis, which is going to be tomorrow 2021-02-23 at 22:31:37 UTC, the spacecraft will pass above the landing site. Given this circumstance, it can now enter the 2 sidereal day reconnaissance orbit, which will then have a repeating ground track that always passes over the landing site.</p>



<p>There is no magic involved in these adjustments. Coming in from the previous orbit last Saturday, when arriving to the periapsis it is just enough to adjust the apoapsis altitude (and hence the orbit period) in such a way that when the spacecraft comes to the next periapsis Mars has rotated below the orbit so as to place the longitude of the landing site below the orbit. The required period to do this will depend on the (signed) difference between the longitude of the periapsis where the burn is performed and the longitude of the landing site. Therefore, the name “phasing orbit” is completely justified. The purpose of the current orbit would be to wait until the rotation of Mars places the landing site below the orbit.</p>



<p>To see what the passage to the 2 sidereal day orbit at next periapsis would look like, I have made this <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Tianwen/orbit/phasing_orbit.script">GMAT script</a>. By adjusting the delta-V of the periapsis burn, I have seen that a 40.9 m/s burn will give an orbit with a ground track that is very close to be repeating. This is shown in the figure below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_052.png"><img width="644" height="315" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_052-644x315.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_052-644x315.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_052-300x147.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_052-768x376.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_052.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>2 sidereal day orbit, with ground track passing over the landing site</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is some degree of complication here regarding orbit perturbations. The plot above shows 14 days of ground track, and we see that at some point the ground track starts to slowly creep to the east. The propagator I’m using here is quite detailed: the 80×80 <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001JGR...10623359L/abstract">GMM-2B</a> Mars gravity model, point mass forces for all planets and the Sun, relativistic effects, and an integration step of at most 50 seconds (no solar radiation pressure or atmospheric drag, though).</p>



<p>Something I haven’t understood completely is why the period of the orbit shown above is actually 162 seconds longer than two sidereal days. Forgetting about perturbations, the track of such an orbit would drift some 0.66 degrees to the west per revolution. However, if I try to adjust the orbit to have a period closer to 2 sidereal days, I get much more drift of the ground track than with this orbit solution. I don’t know if this is caused by perturbations or by numerical accuracy (perhaps related to the integrator). This is something that might deserve more in-depth study. In any case, probably the real-world orbit will need some degree of station keeping to correct for perturbations.</p>



<p>The apoapsis radius of this 2 sidereal day orbit is 61217 km (giving an apoapsis altitude of 57821 km), while the periapsis has an altitude of 282 km (logically, still close to the 280 km we started with on Saturday). Therefore, some care should be taken when quoting this as a 265 x 60000 km orbit. That can be slightly misleading, as it is not clear if 60000 km refers to the apoapsis radius or altitude.</p>



<p>To summarize, in this post we have shown that it is very likely that the purpose of the current orbit is to pass over the landing site at next periapsis on 2021-02-23 22:31:37 UTC. Then a burn would lower the apoapsis further to obtain an orbit with a period of 2 sidereal days that has a repeating ground track passing over the landing site.</p>

<p>My recent article, <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9150"><em>The reshaped Mac experience</em></a>, received a lot of attention judging from the response on Twitter and the WordPress analytics — apparently, among other places, it reached Hacker News and Reddit. Unlike my four-part series&nbsp;<em>‌Mac OS Catalina: more trouble than it’s worth</em>, however, it didn’t attract any hate mail at all. The sheer majority of feedback I received was very positive, with many many people agreeing with me and my observations. A few — some provocatively, some genuinely curious — asked me something along the lines of, <em>Well, if you dislike the current Big Sur UI and Mac experience, what’s an example of Mac OS UI and experience you DO&nbsp;like?</em></p>
<p>It’s a more than fair question, and this piece serves as an answer. When I wrote back to those who asked me, I replied <em>Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</em>. It was sort of a gut-reply based largely on fond memories of using that Mac OS version quite extensively.</p>
<p>When I purchased my 15-inch MacBook Pro in July 2009, it came with Mac OS X 10.5.7 (Leopard), but I immediately upgraded to Snow Leopard when it was released a month or so afterwards. As you know (and if you don’t, here’s a refresher), together with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, Snow Leopard was one of the Mac OS versions with the longest lifespan — almost two years, from August 2009 to July 2011, when the final 10.6.8 v1.1 minor release came out. On my 2009 MacBook Pro, I kept using it until mid-2012, as Mac OS X 10.7 Lion (released in July 2011) didn’t fully convince me at first, so I waited until at least version 10.7.3 before upgrading.</p>
<p>So, I used Snow Leopard on my 2009 MacBook Pro for about three years, and then again on a 2010 Mac mini that a friend gave me to maintain, as a sort of offsite backup. That Mac mini was kept on Mac OS X 10.6.8 for the whole four years it was in my custody (2011–2015) and it was switched off only twice during that period and maybe restarted four or five times in total. It enjoyed an insane uptime and it was a testament to Snow Leopard’s stability.</p>
<p>But back to my ‘gut-reply’, I wanted to be certain that my fond memories of Snow Leopard weren’t just nostalgia. While I am confident when I say that Snow Leopard is the most stable version of Mac OS, I wanted to make sure its user interface was really the good user interface and experience I was remembering. So, after a few frustrating attempts at creating a virtual machine on my current iMac with Mac OS High Sierra, I decided to install Snow Leopard on a USB flash drive, and boot my 2009 MacBook Pro (yes, it’s still alive <span>&amp;</span> kicking) in Snow Leopard from that flash&nbsp;drive.</p>

<em>Ah, When Mac OS welcomed you after the installation process was complete…</em></p>
<p>Since the MacBook Pro doesn’t have an optical drive anymore, I had to create a bootable USB flash drive from my original Snow Leopard DVD Installer. The fastest method is to use Disk Utility — rather, an older version of Disk Utility, from a time when this application was <em>really</em> a utility, and you could use the Restore feature <em>reliably</em> to clone the bootable DVD to (in this case) an external volume.</p>
<p>From a bootable USB flash drive to another USB flash drive, installation was relatively fast, about 20–25 minutes. Although I would have preferred an external SSD for the speed, I must say that using Snow Leopard from the flash drive is a breeze nonetheless. The system is responsive and I haven’t noticed any particular lags.</p>
<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>Now let’s examine just a few aspects of Snow Leopard’s user interface — just like I did for Big Sur in my logbook — and draw comparisons with Big Sur’s interface.</p>
<h3>The menu&nbsp;bar</h3>
<p>Back in August 2020 when I started testing the first Big Sur beta versions, <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/8954">I wrote in my Big Sur logbook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Big Sur, the menu bar by default isn’t solid white, but has a noticeable degree of transparency: it takes the colour of the desktop wallpaper behind it, in an attempt to blend in with the rest of the desktop environment. Some may consider this sleek, but it’s just gimmicky and usability-hostile.</p>
<p>What happens when the desktop wallpaper has darker colours? Well, menu items and menu bar icons become white, of course. The problem is that the wallpaper doesn’t have to be too&nbsp;dark.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, when Big Sur decides that the desktop background image is dark enough, text and icons on the menu bar become white. The problem is that there are cases where the background colour simply <em>isn’t</em> dark enough to warrant a change from black text and icons to white text and icons. Consequently, the contrast is too poor. The only option for better usability is to select <em>Reduce transparency</em> in <em>System Preferences</em> → <em>Accessibility</em>. This brings the menu bar back to a useful state, solid white with black elements.</p>
<p>In Snow Leopard, the menu bar has transparency set to <em>on</em> by default, but it’s definitely more subtle, even with darker desktop backgrounds:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=960%2C500" alt="" width="960" height="500" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=260%2C135 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=640%2C333 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=768%2C400 768w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=1194%2C622 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><em>In the top image, menu bar transparency is off; in the bottom image, transparency is on. The difference is almost negligible.</em></p>
<p>Only with certain background images that contain dark and light areas starkly juxtaposed can menu bar transparency become a bit of an issue under Snow Leopard, but that is partly mitigated by the visible drop shadow beneath the menu bar itself, which helps to make the menu bar stand out&nbsp;more:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=960%2C672" alt="" width="960" height="672" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?w=1000 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=260%2C182 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=640%2C448 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=768%2C538 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Contrast, even in these conditions, tends to be more tolerable than in Big Sur, at least for my eyes. And in any case, in Snow Leopard you can quickly turn off transparency right in <em>System Preferences</em> → <em>Desktop <span>&amp;</span> Screen Saver:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?resize=748%2C658" alt="" width="748" height="658" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?w=748 748w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?resize=260%2C229 260w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?resize=640%2C563 640w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><em>I’ve been talking about ‘transparency’, whereas it’s actually ‘translucency’ — at least in Snow Leopard.</em></p>
<h3>Finder windows</h3>
<p>In Snow Leopard, Finder windows are essentially perfect from a user interface standpoint.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=850%2C558" alt="" width="850" height="558" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?w=850 850w, https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=260%2C171 260w, https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=640%2C420 640w, https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=768%2C504 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When I shared this over Twitter, Mario Guzmán <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1360651998358425601?s=20">observed</a> that <em>Things are nicely compartmentalized by color. You can distinctly tell each section of the window (even the damn scroll bars)… it’s not just one blob of white with grey symbols.</em></p>
<p>Exactly this. The window has clearly distinguishable areas: the <em>Title bar</em> (with the semaphore controls at the top left of the window, and the sidebar+toolbar show/hide toggle button at the top right), the <em>Toolbar</em>, the <em>Sidebar</em> (with colourful icons helping you quickly and easily locate items at a glance), the <em>Path bar</em>, the <em>Status bar</em>, and finally the <em>scroll bars</em> which are always visible.</p>
<p>Persistent up/down arrows and scroll bars are the right thing to do, usability-wise, and it is such a user-friendly design. The length of the ‘aqua blue’ bar immediately gives you an idea of how populated that folder you just opened is going to be. Further, if you need to rapidly scroll down, you just grab the bar with the mouse pointer and scroll.</p>
<p>In later Mac OS versions, scroll bars are set by default to appear only based on mouse/trackpad movement, which is a pity; many users probably don’t realise they can have scroll bars appear permanently, so they don’t have to time the mouseover action for the scroll bar to appear and then <em>hope</em> they’ll manage to grab it when they want to quickly scroll down a long list of elements.</p>
<p>I am once again reminded of that infamous quote by Alan Dye (Apple’s VP of Human Interface) from WWDC 2020, speaking of Big Sur’s UI redesign:&nbsp;<em>‌We’ve reduced visual complexity to keep the focus on users’ content. Buttons and controls appear when you need them, and they recede when you don’t.</em> I still believe this is not a good approach in general, and especially for essential elements like scroll bars, which should always be visible by default, because they are UI elements whose usefulness isn’t limited to when you use them or interact with them — they signal something even when not strictly needed. In the case of the scroll bars it’s a visual estimate of how many elements a folder contains, how long a list of items is, and more importantly <em>your current position</em> when scrolling.</p>
<p>Back to Finder windows, here’s an “Apple’s attention to detail” detail: notice that icon in the bottom left of the window? It is a subtle visual cue that tells you if Finder icons (items) are sorted, unsorted, or simply snapped to a grid. When opening windows from read-only volumes, the icon of a crossed-out pencil appears here, meaning that you can’t modify the enclosed items or write to that volume.</p>

<em>Window from a read-only volume</em></p>
<p>While I don’t find this UI detail to be crucial, it is certainly nice to have, and an example of those little things that contributed to make the Mac’s interface great. As I said above, it reflected a certain attention to detail and overall thoughtfulness I’ve seen progressively fade away in later Mac OS releases.</p>
<h2>A look back at a few system apps, with occasional UI comparisons between Snow Leopard and Big&nbsp;Sur</h2>
<h3>Safari</h3>
<p>5.1.10 was the last version of Safari running on Mac OS X 10.6.8. Here are a few things I still prefer over the current Safari:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=845%2C92" alt="" width="845" height="92" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?w=845 845w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=260%2C28 260w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=640%2C70 640w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=768%2C84 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
<em>The blue progress bar</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=852%2C100" alt="" width="852" height="100" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?w=852 852w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=260%2C31 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=640%2C75 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=768%2C90 768w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
<em>The RSS button (you could read RSS feeds with Safari)</em></p>
<p>Another detail I very much prefer in the older Safari over more recent versions of Safari is how the plus [+] button near the address bar works. Its placement makes its function rather unequivocal: <em>Add the current page to something</em>. As usual, tooltips are helpful:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png?resize=562%2C92" alt="" width="562" height="92" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png?w=562 562w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png?resize=260%2C43 260w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>But what if I want to add this page to my Reading List? No worries, when you actually press the [+], a thoughtfully-designed sheet comes down, and you can put the current page exactly where you want: in your Reading List, in the Top Sites, or in your Bookmarks.</p>

One of the reasons this is a major problem is that players are a very vocal group. They are notorious for letting the world know they are unhappy when poor network conditions ruin their experience.</p><p><strong>Now, imagine the impact someone with real influence and a massive following can have when they voice their displeasure with your game.</strong></p><p>That’s EXACTLY what happened when <a href="https://theblast.com/c/snoop-dogg-goes-off-on-bill-gates-ea-sports-when-madden-server-goes-down-video">Snoop Dogg exploded on EA Sports</a> when Madden servers crashed.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614014215234_38706"><div>

<p><em>It’s been a while since the last post, and I have to apologize for the long wait. The last weeks have been quite busy, but I finally managed to complete another article. I hope you’ll enjoy it.</em></p>
<h2 id="map-and-reduce">Map and Reduce</h2>
<p>This is going to be a boring article about two boring functions, <code>map()</code> and <code>reduce()</code>. Here is the story:</p>
<p>You have a list with elements of type, say, <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>You define a function that takes a <code>string</code> and produces an <code>int</code>. Let’s say you want to know the length of a string.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>length</span>(s <span>string</span>) <span>int</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>len</span>(s)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now you define a function called <code>map()</code> that takes this function and applies it to each of the elements in the list and returns a list of all results.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>mäp</span>(list []<span>string</span>, fn <span>func</span>(<span>string</span>)<span>int</span>) []<span>int</span> { <span>// "map" is a reserved word, "mäp" isn't
</span><span></span>	res <span>:=</span> <span>make</span>([]<span>int</span>, <span>len</span>(list))
	<span>for</span> i, elem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> list {
		res[i] = <span>fn</span>(elem)
	}
	<span>return</span> res
}
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, you define another function <code>reduce()</code> that takes the result list and boils it down to a single result..</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>reduce</span>(list []<span>int</span>, fn <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>, <span>int</span>)<span>int</span>) (res <span>int</span>) {
	<span>for</span> _, elem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> list {
		res = <span>fn</span>(res, elem)
	}
	<span>return</span> res
}

<span>func</span> <span>sum</span>(a,b <span>int</span>) <span>int</span> {
	<span>return</span> a<span>+</span>b
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can wire it all up.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	list <span>:=</span> []<span>string</span>{<span>"a"</span>, <span>"bcd"</span>, <span>"ef"</span>, <span>"g"</span>, <span>"hij"</span>}
	res <span>:=</span> <span>reduce</span>(<span>mäp</span>(list, len), sum)
	fmt.<span>Println</span>(res)
}
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/P7-1ro4a_d">(Playground link)</a></p>

<p>That’s it. End of the story. Pretty boring, eh?</p>
<h2 id="but-wait-">But wait! …</h2>
<p>… what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>Looks like we just abstracted away the concept of <code>for</code> loops!</strong></p>
<p>Now if that’s not something to brag about on the next Gopher meetup…</p>
<p>However, does this buy us anything else? Indeed it does:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, no more one-off index errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, and more importantly, if the mapped function <code>fn</code> does not depend on previous results, it can be trivially called in a concurrent manner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How to do this? Easy: Split the list into <em>n</em> pieces and pass them to <em>n</em> independently running mappers. Next, have the mappers run on separate CPU cores, or even on separate CPU’s.</p>
<p>Imagine the speed boost you’ll get. Map and reduce, as it seems, form a fundamental concept for efficient distributed loops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lemme repeat that. By abstracting away the very concept of looping, you can implement looping any way you want, including implementing it in a way that scales nicely with extra hardware.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">Can Your Programming Language Do This?</a> (2006)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="from-map-and-reduce-to-mapreduce">From map() and reduce() to MapReduce</h2>
<p>Google researchers took the map/reduce concept and scaled it up to search engine level (I leave the exact definition of “search engine level” as an exercise for the reader). <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html">MapReduce was born</a>.</p>
<p>The result was a highly scalable, fault-tolerant data processing framework with the two functions <code>map()</code> and <code>reduce()</code> at its core.</p>
<p>Here is how it works.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a couple of text files and we want to calculate the average count of nouns &amp; verbs per file.</p>
<p>Our imaginary test machine has eight CPU cores. So we can set up eight processing entities/work units/actors (or whatever you want to call them):</p>
<ul>
<li>One input reader</li>
<li>Three mappers</li>
<li>One shuffler, or partitioner</li>
<li>Two reducers</li>
<li>One output writer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-input-reader">The input reader</h3>
<p>The input reader fetches the documents, turns each one into a list of words, and distributes the lists among the mappers.</p>
<h3 id="the-mapper">The mapper</h3>
<p>Each of the mappers reads the input list word by word and counts the nouns and verbs in that list.</p>
<p>The result is a key-value list of word types (noun, verb) and counts. For example, our three mappers could return these counts:</p>
<pre><code>mapper 1:
    nouns: 7
    verbs: 4

mapper 2:
    nouns: 5
    verbs: 8

mapper 3:
    nouns: 6
    verbs: 3
</code></pre>
<p>When a mapper has finished, it passes the result on to the shuffler.</p>
<h3 id="the-shuffler">The shuffler</h3>
<p>The shuffler receives the output lists from the mappers. It rearranges the data by key; that’s why it is also referred to as “partitioning function”. In our example, the shuffler generates two lists, one for nouns and one for verbs:</p>
<pre><code>list 1:
    nouns: 7
    nouns: 5
    nouns: 6

list 2:
    verbs: 4
    verbs: 8
    verbs: 3
</code></pre>
<p>The shuffler then passes each list to one of the two reducers.</p>
<h3 id="the-reducer">The reducer</h3>
<p>Each reducer receives a list with a couple of counts. It simply runs through the list, adds up all the counts, and divides the result by the number of counts. Both reducers then send their output to the output writer.</p>
<p>Back to our example. The first reducer would calculate an average of</p>
<pre><code>(7 + 5 + 6) / 3 = 6
</code></pre>
<p>and the other one would return</p>
<pre><code>(4 + 8 + 3) / 3 = 5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-output-writer">The output writer</h3>
<p>All the output writer has to do is collecting the results from the reducers and write them to disk or pass them on to some consumer process.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>To make all this less abstract, here is the same as an animation. (Click on Play.)</p>


<p>This concept easily scales beyond a single multi-CPU machine. The involved entities - input reader, mapper, shuffler, reducer, and output writer - can even run on different machines if required.</p>
<p>But MapReduce is more than just some distributed version of <code>map()</code> and <code>reduce()</code>. There are a couple of additional bonuses that we get from a decent MapReduce implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>A good deal of the functionality is the same for any kind of map/reduce task. These parts can be implemented as a MapReduce framework where the user just needs to provide the <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions.</li>
<li>The MapReduce framework can provide fault recovery. If a node fails, the framework can re-execute the affected tasks on another node.</li>
<li>With fault tolerance mechanisms in place, MapReduce can run on large clusters of commodity hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
<p>The code below is a very simple version of the noun/verb average calculation. To keep the code short and clear, the mapper does not actually identify nouns and verbs. Instead, the input text is just a list of strings that read either “noun” or “verb”. Also, the reducer does not receive key/value pairs but rather just the values. We already know that one reducer receives the nouns and the other receives the verbs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my cofounder</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineboulanger/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I</a> have engaged in hundreds of conversations with engineering leaders on our journey to improve engineering. We talked with Silicon Valley startups just getting started as well as established enterprises with thousand-person headcounts.</p>
<p>What we discovered surprised us: <strong>Not only can software engineering effectiveness be measured; most engineering teams follow the exact same evolution.</strong></p>
<p>From a two-person startup to a thousand-person team, engineering success always comes from the same fundamentals: 1) Hire excellent engineers and 2) <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Remove the blockers that prevent their success</a>.</p>
<p>Different team sizes, however, change the ways these fundamentals manifest. Broadly, they fit into five stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative</li>
<li>Data-Curious</li>
<li>People-Driven Engineering Effectiveness</li>
<li>Software-Driven Effectiveness</li>
<li>Engineering Effectiveness as a Strategic Advantage</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.okayhq.com/assets/img/5_stages_o.a91f2d0.png" alt="The 5 stages of Engineering Effectiveness"></p><p>While you're perusing these stages, keep in mind that every engineering org starts somewhere and every org can reach stage 5. Regardless of the size or age of your team, your engineering effectiveness would benefit from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objectively assessing your current engineering org: What stage are you in and why?Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solidifying a strong foundation: Ensure you've built all the components of your current and lower stages.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Aiming higher: Add advanced functions to accelerate your achievement.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, individual organizations have their own unique traits, so you should feel free to make this framework your own. On the whole, however, here's how to grow:Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-qualitative">Stage 1: Qualitative</h2>
<p>Most engineering teams start small. At this point (usually around 1-20 people), the team is evolving rapidly and there aren't many objective metrics to measure success.</p>
<p><strong>In stage 1, the most successful engineering organizations build a strong social, cultural, and behavioral foundation.</strong> This foundation should include implementing widely-known best practices like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sprint retrospectives</a> to identify patterns of effectiveness</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Test-driven development</a> and version control with small, frequent commits</li>
<li>Flexible hours with high employee autonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>With stage 1 being almost metric-free, engineering success relies almost entirely on your first-line managers.  We've found these managers to be the differentiators between successful stage 1 orgs and those that flounder. If your org is in stage 1, be on the lookout for strong managers: ones who are either experienced and well-trained or inexperienced but exceptionally fast learners.</p>
<p>To support a stage 1 engineering org, company leadership should create a high-trust environment in team meetings/all hands (to encourage feedback) and keep a pulse on morale through high-quality one-on-ones. It's also helpful for long-term culture to invest in manager growth and development, particularly around people skills and EQ. (We've found <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-develop-and-support-managers/steps/introduction/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google's framework</a> to be particularly effective at helping managers become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">servant leaders</a>.)</p>
<p>In stage 1, engineering revolves around culture: you'll succeed if your managers can support and align your team.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-data-curious-and-reactive">Stage 2: Data-Curious and Reactive</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 2 is when most orgs first become aware of engineering effectiveness as an area to improve, so they start dabbling in data.</strong></p>
<p>As most stage 2 orgs are small and fast-growing (20-50 people), they must still rely heavily on first-line managers for qualitative measures like:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OKR</a> completion</li>
<li>Team engagement</li>
<li>Hiring targets</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 2 will also bring your first quantitative measures, typically in the form of ad hoc metrics like:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug counts</li>
<li>Alert rates</li>
<li>Employee satisfaction surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>On the dev ops side, successful stage 2 orgs typically begin investing in a pipeline aimed at achieving continuous delivery. These investments often include custom scripts or open-source tools that provide snapshots of their DORA metrics.</p>
<p>These instantaneous measurements and metrics help make stage 2 engineering orgs more effective than those in stage 1. That said, these stage 2 improvements are typically ad hoc, one-off, and isolated. Instead of a comprehensive, real-time dashboard or even a long-term feedback loop, stage 2 orgs act on instantaneous information as it arises, necessarily making the org's improvements reactive.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-people-driven-engineering-effectiveness">Stage 3: People-Driven Engineering Effectiveness Â&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The typical stage 3 engineering org will have 50-250 engineers and feel like it's in a transition stage between independent qualitative assessments and fully-automated metrics.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In stage 3, the best engineering teams establish a dedicated function for engineering effectiveness</strong>, most frequently through a dedicated internal team or by hiring an engineering chief of staff. This dedicated function will begin to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>A regular cadence of investments in dev tech, processes, and tooling</li>
<li>Looker dashboards to capture DORA metrics in real time</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SLAs/SLOs</a> for engineering effectiveness</li>
<li>Tangible, objectively-verifiable effectiveness metrics that will hold managers accountableÂ&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While stage 3 brings both long-term metrics and systems that provide a holistic view, most of these activities will be performed by hand.</strong> For example, the engineering Chief of Staff or program manager might ask directors to fill out a spreadsheet, which will then evolve into a powerpoint presentation that prompts the VP to make adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>A successful stage 3 engineering org will implement a dedicated engineering effectiveness team to measure metrics and incorporate adjustments at a reliable cadence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="stage-4-software-driven-effectiveness">Stage 4: Software-Driven Effectiveness</h2>
<p><strong>In stage 4, dedicated software enters the picture, bringing continuous improvement to every engineering stage.</strong></p>
<p>The typical stage 4 engineering org will have hundreds or thousands of engineers. At this scale, treating engineering like a black box is no longer acceptable. Instead, managers will require precise, quantitative assessments instead of qualitative or imprecise measures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most successful stage 4 teams automate a high variety of engineering metrics, either through dashboards built by a full-time engineering effectiveness team or by leveraging <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third-party software</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These dashboards gather actionable, real-time effectiveness metrics at every level of management:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CTO sets high-level metrics and goals, typically through a dashboard they share with the other executives.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Directors/mid-level managers set goals for their sub-orgs and monitor their metrics for early signs of issues.</li>
<li>First-line managers provide root-cause analysis on the specific factors contributing to high-level metrics.</li>
<li>Every engineering OKR includes goals around effectiveness and improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before stage 4, engineering teams often aim to measure everything. In stage 4, they aim more precisely at high-value metrics like engineer utilization, <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blockers</a>, and work-life balance. Stage 4 brings the ability for an org to diagnose specific symptoms all the way down to their root causes, where they can form coherent, data-backed stories that inform pinpointed improvements. The most successful stage 4 teams will even start uncovering personalized metrics that they find particularly correlate to their success.</p>
<p><strong>By combining automated, real-time metrics with the culture of continuous improvement built in stages 1-3, stage 4 teams can evolve their effectiveness into an always-running, well-oiled improvement machine.</strong></p>
<h2 id="stage-5-engineering-effectiveness-as-a-strategic-advantage">Stage 5: Engineering Effectiveness as a Strategic Advantage</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 5 turns engineering effectiveness into a strategic lever that helps the company achieve precise business goals.</strong></p>
<p>Even though a typical stage 5 team will contain hundreds or thousands of engineers all around the world, the best stage 5 orgs run like a well-coordinated symphony: individual contributions come together to create a single unit that's much more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>On top of stage 4's software-based measurement and org-wide culture of improvement, stage 5 adds a strategic lens. The best stage 5 organizations can make calculated risks involving conscious trade-offs. Perhaps the org extrapolates a concerning quality trend and adjusts its features long before engineers or customers start to complain. The best stage 5 organizations can calculate specific risk levels and readjust without unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>High-performing stage 5 teams typically engage in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry/peer-group <a href="https://dealstruck.com/resources/the-power-of-peer-benchmarking/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">benchmarking</a> (to understand their effectiveness compared to other companies)</li>
<li>Automatic implementation of the latest effectiveness research (to accelerate constant improvement)</li>
<li>Anticipatory activities at every stage in the org (to predict potential problems before they arise)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thought leadership on new best practices of engineering effectiveness (naturally uncovered as a result of their experience)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Full transparency/understanding of engineering metrics, even outside of the engineering org (to aid company-wide improvement)</li>
<li>Calculated risks (to achieve precise business aims)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the outside, a stage 5 team looks like a strong engineering brand. It can accelerate and adjust, attract top talent while achieving business aims.</p>
<h2 id="toward-engineering-effectiveness">Toward Engineering EffectivenessÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Engineering effectiveness is too expensive to be left to chance. Start by assessing where your team currently is. Are you:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficiently small that metrics are still a "nice to have"?</li>
<li>Data-curious and ready to react?</li>
<li>In need of a dedicated effectiveness team?</li>
<li>Positioned to produce a continuously improving organizationÂ&nbsp;?</li>
<li>Able to precisely tune your priorities to enable the company's long-term strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, solidify your position at your current stage, building a solid foundation on which you can expand.</strong></p>
<p>While every engineering team has its own individual nuance, most will follow this consistent evolution. We uncovered these stages through years of observation, but there's still more improvement to be applied to engineering.</p>
<p>We've made it our mission to improve engineering effectiveness. If you've uncovered your own trends or if you're curious for more, <a href="https://okayhq.typeform.com/to/O47Fx3Q7" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">let us know</a>. We'd love to improve engineering effectiveness for everyone.</p></div></div></div>]]>

This might sound like an unrealistic tech. However, it is possible and in the future, we can see solar panels working at night also. The University of California (UC), Davis scientists are inventing a prototype for an ‘anti-solar panels’ that would work opposite to a classic solar panel. The new studies suggest that it is possible that such panels could work round the clock.</p><p><br>These anti-solar panels can produce a quarter of the energy they generate throughout the day under ideal conditions. The scientist reveals the requirement to combine thermoradiative panels that could produce energy on account of radiative cooling. In radiative cooling due to thermal radiation, a body dissipates out its heat. The thermoradiative cells are used for the experiment for manufacturing. After that, they transfigure the heat into electricity.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="391" src="https://i1.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-15.png?resize=800%2C391&amp;ssl=1" alt="anti-solar panels installed on building" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-15.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-15.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-15.png?resize=768%2C375&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><h3>Research Behind Anti-Solar Panels</h3><p>ACS Photonics publication has published a research paper. In this paper, the scientists have revealed how they developed the anti-solar cells. Which perform their function of radiative cooling. Some engineers from UC states were puzzled concerning what would be the result if they installed one of the solar panels in a warm area, and pointed it towards the sky. It tends to concentrate on visible light to give rise to efficacious cells that could use the night sky and space as a heat sink. Jeremy Munday, an electrical and computer engineer from UC states mention that physics was identical in both the tech, only the materials are varying.</p><p><br>However this technology is in its initial phases, the team is in the middle of developing prototypes. The important point about this research is, it can be made economical to hold solar panels functional for a day. Last but not the least, according to scientists the enigmatic space is an interesting, comparatively unexplored area. However, it can assist and deliver electrical power at night and day with the proper utilization of materials science, optics, and photonics.</p><p><br>Hope you all like it, please share your valuable views about this tech in the comment section.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>As discussed <a href="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/dependency-inference/">in our post on dependency inference</a>, Pants understands which files depend on which to offer fine-grained caching. If none of the inputs have changed, Pants can safely cache your builds like running tests and generating code.</p><p>With conventional scalable build tools, this fine-grained invalidation requires substantial boilerplate: maintaining BUILD files that explicitly declare every dependency. Instead, Pants uses <em>dependency inference</em> to reduce this boilerplate by up to 90% by reading your code and figuring out the dependencies for you.</p><p>As of Pants 2.2, Pants now knows how to use dependency inference with <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protobuf</a>! This includes:</p><ul><li>Protobuf imports of other Protobuf files.</li><li>Python imports of generated Protobuf code, including gRPC.</li></ul><p>While Pants currently only generates code with Protobuf, we are eager to work with <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">community members</a> to support other protocols like Apache Thrift.</p><hr><h3 id="wth-is-pants">WTH is Pants?</h3><p>Pants is a scalable build tool, meaning that it orchestrates the tools you use in a modern Python repository, like Black, Pytest, Protoc (Protobufs), and setuptools. Pants will run these and many other tools concurrently, and brings fine-grained caching with minimal boilerplate, including as your codebase scales up in size.</p><p>See <a href="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/introducing-pants-v2/">blog.pantsbuild.org/introducing-pants-v2/</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>Pants will first look at your repository's code layout and your Protobuf and Python file names to develop a global mapping. For example, we know that <code>protos/project/models.proto</code> corresponds to the Protobuf import <code>project/models.proto</code> and the Python modules <code>project.models_pb2</code> and (possibly) <code>project.models_pb2_grpc</code>.</p><p>With this global mapping computed, Pants then parses the relevant files to extract their import statements and look up the corresponding owner, if any.</p><p>For example, given this Proto:</p><pre><code>// protos/build/remote/execution/remote_execution.proto
package build.remote.execution;

import "build/semver/semver.proto";
import "google/api/annotations.proto";
import "google/rpc/status.proto";
import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";</code></pre><p>Pants infers dependencies on the correct Protobuf files:</p><pre><code>❯ ./pants dependencies protos/build/remote/execution/remote_execution.proto
protos/build/semver/semver.proto
protos/google/api/annotations.proto
protos/google/rpc/status.proto
protos/google/protobuf/duration.proto</code></pre><p>Pants will also understand Python imports of these Protobuf files, normalizing their full paths into Python module names:</p><pre><code># src/py/project/app.py
import build.semver.semver_pb2
import google.api.annotations_pb2_grpc</code></pre><pre><code>❯ ./pants dependencies src/py/project/app.py
protos/build/semver/semver.proto
protos/google/api/annotations.proto</code></pre><p>As discussed in <a href="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/fast-incremental-builds-speculation-cancellation/">our post on Pants's performance</a>, this inference is 1) very safe and 2) very fast. Because Pants invokes processes hermetically with a sandbox, failing to infer a dependency can never cause the wrong thing to be cached. Further, the inference is fast thanks to Pants's core being implemented in Rust, along with a daemon, parallelism, and very fine-grained invalidation.</p><h2 id="trying-out-pants">Trying out Pants</h2><p>Using Pants ensures that your builds always use your up-to-date Protobuf code—no more need to manually invoke scripts! Further, thanks to Pants's fine-grained understanding of your project's dependencies, you will only ever generate the Protobuf files you actually need.</p><p>We optimized Pants to be easy to <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/existing-repositories">add incrementally to existing repositories</a>, including an upcoming feature in Pants 2.3 to auto-generate BUILD files (stay tuned for a blog post!).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">Pants community</a> would love to help you get started. <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.1/docs">www.pantsbuild.org/docs</a><br></p>

<p>This week I had a discussion with one of my friends on how to choose a programming language. It was triggered by multiple discussions I had with our customers on their engineering strategy in the last six months and one question that came multiple times was should we use X programming language for our new initiatives. Some customers were thinking of moving from .NET stack to Java, some banks were thinking about moving to Golang because their technical leaders have watched Monzo talks on Golang, for some it was from Java to Kotlin, and some were thinking of dumping JavaScript for Typescript.</p>



<p>To come up with the answer I try to find answers to following questions in context of the organization:</p>



<ul><li>What is the maturity of the programming language with respect to its community and ecosystem? Should they spend their one innovation token on this language?</li><li>How easy it is to find available talent in the market for that programming language?&nbsp;</li><li>How easy it is for the organization to acquire production engineering know-how for a programming language?</li><li>What are the productivity and efficiency gains that can be achieved from using a programming language? Are those gains aligned with the organization goals?</li><li>What are the use-cases an organization wants to solve with the programming language?</li><li>What is the future of a programming language? For a big enterprise it is important if the language can last for a decade.</li><li>What is the learning curve of the programming language? Can existing staff be upskilled?</li></ul>



<p>There is no correct answer to these questions. Most engineering organizations will end up using multiple programming languages. For example an organization may choose Golang as a general purpose language to build backend services, Python for scripting and data related work, Typescript for building web frontend. It is also possible that an engineering organization might choose Python for building most services and for few where performance and efficiency is important it chooses Golang. I think the important point is defining a small list of programming languages for the organization and documenting when you will choose which programming language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I use a decision matrix like the one shown below to come up with one possible answer. Depending on which factors are important to the organization they can give them weights and that will impact the score of the language. In the image shown below, language 1 is the winner.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGB2gGPDUN24IZXig5kZSGzKwcpwSIfP5dzPMp5gxTpIGw5g5rRlqcsWPSTYDY0QWf6U0D14oL9dfTeRZlDanEwK54XjJIirmMeIGTL62skChi8YxVTBZcpeJyRbnveFCKYW3d7U" alt=""></figure>



<p>As I was writing this post a few more questions came to my mind.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Does a programming language help us write less buggy software?</li><li>Does a programming language have some constructs that help us reduce the essential complexity of the system?</li><li>What constraints does a programming language impose and how do they impact the business goals?</li><li>Can a programming language be a competitive advantage for an organization?</li><li>Can a programming language influence the quality of the development team, the quality of code, and practices they follow?</li><li>Does a programming language influence engineering organization culture?</li><li>Can a programming language over time help average Joe become a good software engineer?</li><li>What makes a programming language future safe? Can we predict it to safeguard us?</li><li>Should a language choice depend on NFRs that you want to achieve?</li><li>How does a programming language influence behavior of a team?</li></ul>



<p>I don’t have answers to all of the above mentioned questions. I am hoping there is academic research done on the above but I am yet to read those papers.</p>



<p>I did some research on why different organizations choose certain languages and I found the following key points.</p>



<ol><li>Gitlab – Ruby – <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/29/why-we-use-rails-to-build-gitlab/">Link</a><ul><li>GitHub, a source of inspiration for GitLab, was also based on Rails, making it a logical pick considering his interest in the framework.</li><li>Ruby on Rails ecosystem allows you to shape a lot of functionality at a high quality</li><li>We need a lot of functionality and Ruby on Rails is a way to do it</li><li>Consistent coding practices. You are guided to do the right thing.</li><li>Big community of Ruby gems</li></ul></li><li>CockroachDB – Golang – <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/why-go-was-the-right-choice-for-cockroachdb/">Link</a><ul><li>its support for libraries, interfaces, and tooling positioned it as the right choice for CockroachDB</li><li>Go was designed to scale to large code bases with an emphasis on simplicity and orthogonality of features. The enforced code style, the simple imports and automated import management, the wide variety of linters, the straightforward (and minimal) set of programmatic idioms…all of these attributes of Go are important for clean, understandable code.</li><li>When comparing to Java, we appreciate the tight focus on implementation instead of OOP and abstraction: interfaces can be added when needed, not as an initial, often unnecessary, step.&nbsp;</li><li>When comparing to C++, we appreciate automatic memory management and how there’s rarely more than one way to get something done, for example with static and one-time initializers.</li><li>Go gives better control over memory allocation that impacts garbage collection.</li></ul></li><li>Asana – TypeScript – <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2014/11/asana-switching-typescript/">Link</a><ul><li>Clean JS</li><li>Community Support</li><li>Errors at compile time instead of runtime</li><li>Static typing</li></ul></li><li>American Express – Golang – <a href="https://go.dev/solutions/americanexpress/">Link</a> and <a href="https://americanexpress.io/choosing-go/">Link</a><ul><li>For their assessment, they chose to build a microservice in four different programming languages. They then compared the four languages for speed/performance, tooling, testing, and ease of development.</li><li>While Go may not have been the fastest language tested, its powerful tooling helped bolster its overall results. Go’s built-in testing framework, profiling capabilities, and benchmarking tools impressed the team.</li><li>Reasons<ul><li>Simple and straightforward</li><li>Encourage best practices</li><li>Concurrency</li><li>Tooling</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Nubank – Clojure – <a href="https://building.nubank.com.br/working-with-clojure-at-nubank/">Link</a><ul><li>Nubank provides services in the finance domain, which is very close to mathematical functions — and functional programming is an excellent fit for both scenarios.</li><li>Clojure, on the other hand, has simple constructs that allow us to focus on the problem we are solving, making evolving the system a small incremental challenge, which doesn’t get that much harder over time.</li><li>Most of our codebase can be understood locally, looking at any given pure function, understanding its outputs for any given set of inputs. There’s rarely any need to reason about or recreate the internal state of objects. Data moves through the system in a composable, inspectable, consistent, and immutable way (without hiding it inside of objects).</li><li>Functional code is much easier to test, and that gives us the confidence to deploy an average of over 50 changes per day in a mission-critical domain.</li><li>Nubank has acquired Cognitect, the US-based software consultancy behind the Clojure programming language and the Datomic database</li></ul></li><li>Janestreet – Ocaml – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmGbOGb2I">Link</a> , <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036">Link</a> , and <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/does-jane-street-use-other-programming-languages-aside-from-ocaml/2761/5">Link</a><ul><li>Brevity of the language and the powerful type system that makes OCaml code very readable</li><li>Powerful abstraction capabilities that reduce boilerplates</li><li>Static type system for ensuring code correctness</li><li>He spoke about some of the fancy type tricks like parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, type inference, phantom types and type indexed values that add to the expressivity of code.</li><li>Also OCaml hits the sweet spot between expressiveness of code and the performance numbers. The very much tunable GC makes things easier to control.</li></ul></li><li>Starling Bank – Java – <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/starling-bank/">Link</a><ul><li>Exceptions are noisy and difficult to ignore</li><li>Reliable ecosystem (user base, tooling, job market, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Integrations with legacy third parties (SOAP etc)</li></ul></li><li>KhanAcademy – Golang – <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/">Link</a><ul><li>Kotlin was more performant</li><li>Golang used much less memory</li></ul></li><li>Lyft – TypeScript – <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/typescript-at-lyft-64f0702346ea">Link</a><ul><li>Popularity</li><li>Type safety</li><li>Less Bugs</li><li>Productivity</li></ul></li><li>Medium – Golang – <a href="https://medium.engineering/rex-mediums-go-recommendation-microservice-e077bc9582a">Link</a><ul><li>More efficient use of the CPU. While Node is single-threaded, Go is much better suited for the combination of I/O and CPU-intensive operations required to build a ranked feed. Splitting our work onto separate Goroutines means we can avoid the issue of the CPU getting hogged by one single request and other requests getting starved.</li><li>Opinionated. Go makes it pretty hard to write “bad” code. A typed language that is also highly opinionated in terms of code styling means that even a newbie to Go (which I was when we started writing Rex) can quickly start writing clean and readable code.</li><li>Prior experience with Go. While much of Medium’s codebase is written in Node, we already had a few smaller-purpose microservices in Go. Adding another microservice in a language that we as a company have familiarity with makes building and maintaining this new service much easier.</li></ul></li><li>Instagram – Python – <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366">Link</a><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Practicality</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>I hope this post helps you understand that there is much more to choosing a programming language.</p>

"Transmission occurs by touching the face, nose, mouth and eyes. Touching one's nose and mouth is significantly reduced when wearing a face mask properly. But wearing a face mask does not protect the eyes," said the study.</p><h3><strong>The COVID-19 Research</strong></h3>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>I love the aesthetics of terminals and I’m not the only one, there is a whole
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">subreddit</a> dedicated to people sharing their desktops and
showcasing different terminal setups. Last year I spent working on
<a href="https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic">an innovative WebAssembly runtime called Lunatic</a>.
Recently we landed TCP support and I was super excited to start building real world applications
with it, and what would be a better fit than a terminal based chat server with a
<a href="https://thenewstack.io/the-lost-worlds-of-telnet/">retro vibe</a>?</p>
<p>It took me around a week to build it with Rust +
<a href="https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic">Lunatic</a> and you can check out the code
<a href="https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/chat">here</a>. If you would like to try it out you
can connect to it with:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>&gt;</span> telnet lunatic.chat

<span>&gt;</span> telnet eu.lunatic.chat</code></pre></div>
<p>While writing the server I ran into many interesting problems and would like to share here how I
leveraged the power of Lunatic to overcome them.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The reason I picked telnet is that the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854">specification</a> is
simple enough to read through and implement in a short time. It’s a small layer on top of TCP and
as mentioned before we had TCP already working. On the other hand, telnet is a really limiting
protocol and I needed to get creative while building a chat application on top of it.</p>
<p>The first issue I encountered was the line based nature of terminals. You write a command, hit
enter and the terminal prints out some text. This doesn’t go well with the UI of a chat app where
messages can come in at any time. What are you supposed to do when new text arrives and the user
has already partially written her own message? Override the user’s input? Print the new message
after the input?</p>
<p>One solution would be to buffer all messages until the user hits enter and then just dump all
the ones that arrived in the meantime at once, but this can’t work as we would rely on the user
to keep hitting enter to read new messages.</p>
<p>It became clear that I needed to use some kind of terminal user interface where I render
separately all the incoming messages from the user who is currently typing. It’s possible to do
this by using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1073">a few</a> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1184">extensions</a>
to the telnet protocol. Once the telnet client connects I send it the following instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t echo anything that the user is typing, let me be in charge of printing in the terminal.</li>
<li>Don’t buffer messages, send each keystroke to the server.</li>
<li>Report size changes of the terminal.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows me to construct the UI on the server and just send a sequence of terminal escape
characters back to bring the user’s terminal up to date. On each keystroke or message received
the UI is updated.</p>
<h3>Massive concurrency</h3>
<p>For this to work we need to permanently keep the telnet connection open and periodically send
data through it. This is a perfect use case for Lunatic’s Processes, they are designed for massive
concurrency. Each client’s connection is handled in a separate Process.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with Operating System processes, Lunatic’s Processes are lightweight and also
known as green threads (but isolated) or <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines">go-routines</a> in other
runtimes. They are fast to create, have a small memory footprint and a low scheduling overhead.
All Processes are preemptively scheduled and they can’t spend too much time running without
yielding and giving others a fair share of the resources. This keeps all connections responsive
in an environment where most of the time is spent waiting on I/O.</p>
<h3>Interop with existing libraries</h3>
<p>Luckily I could make use of existing Rust libraries and didn’t need to reinvent the wheel. I used:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/djc/askama">Askma</a> as a templating engine.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs">TUI</a> as the rendering engine.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chronotope/chrono">Chrono</a> for date formatting.</li>
</ol>
<p>They all compiled to WebAssembly without issues. I just needed to provide a telnet backend for TUI,
but I could reuse most of the code from the <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/termion">termion</a> crate
(sadly it has no Windows support for now).</p>
<p>TUI works in a somewhat similar way to React.js, you update your state and just call a render method.
It will re-render the UI and send back to the client the minimal amount of changes in the form of
terminal escape characters.</p>
<h3>State Management</h3>
<p>A big part of programming is state management. Your application getting into a state that you
couldn’t predict while writing the code is a big source of bugs, and Lunatic tries to simplify
this by allowing you to isolate the state into separate processes.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>From the perspective of a process, it owns the whole memory and can’t influence the memory of
other processes in any way, not even by unsafe pointer dereferencing. This is a result of building
them on top of WebAssembly instances. The only way processes can talk between each other is through
message passing.</p>
<p>This greatly simplifies reasoning about state changes. You only need to think about what state you
are in and how the next message will influence the state change. It makes it a lot easier to debug
once you find yourself in an undesirable state. Let’s look at a concrete code sample from the
implementation:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code>


<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>server_process</span><span>(</span>state_receiver<span>:</span> <span>Receiver</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ServerMessage</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see that the process has a few local variables to keep track of its state:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How many clients are connected.</em></li>
<li><em>Which channels are available.</em></li>
<li><em>If a new user joins what username should be assigned.</em></li>
<li><em>Which usernames are taken.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards the Process just runs in a loop waiting on messages. If a new client is connected the
server receives a <code>ServerMessage::Joined</code> message. It will then update the total count of users,
assign a new username to the client and send back a message notifying the client about the assigned
username.</p>
<p>The client’s process is similarly structured, it keeps a state of the current input box for each
channel and all received messages for the channels. The client’s process can receive 2 types of
messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keystrokes coming from the telnet connection.</em></li>
<li><em>New chat messages coming from all subscribed channels.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For each keystroke we update the current channel’s input box or attach the new message to the
history of messages in the channel.</p>
<p>If we have such an architecture and run into a bug, let’s say the number of connected users shown
is wrong, there is only one source of truth here and we know exactly where this information came
from. We just need to figure out how we got into this state.</p>
<h3>Other benefits</h3>
<p>There are some not so obvious additional benefits that we get from Lunatic.</p>
<p>If a client’s process receives some malicious data from the telnet connection and crashes, it
will only terminate the existing connection. It can’t access the state of any other Processes.
In my first implementation I was often using <code>.unwrap</code> in the code, following
<a href="https://verraes.net/2014/12/erlang-let-it-crash/">Erlang’s let it crash philosophy</a> and knowing
that if I see any crashes in the logs I can always later investigate why they happened, but the
application should continue running.</p>
<p>The message sending implementation uses <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/1.2.5/smol/channel/index.html">Smol’s channels</a>
underneath, but you may be surprised not to see any <code>async</code> or <code>.await</code> keywords in the code.
The reason for this is that Lunatic abstracts away the asynchronous code and you can just write
seemingly blocking code, but it actually never blocks the underlying thread and takes full
advantage of async Rust. This is a whole topic on its own so I will leave it for another blog post.</p>
<p>Lunatic works with any code that can compile to WebAssembly, and as I have shown earlier a lot of
libraries just work out of the box. You can also
<a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-static-link-c-lib-to-wasm/36558/5">link C code into your Rust application</a>
while compiling to WebAssembly. One big pain point when using C from Erlang is that you need to be
extremely careful in your code, because if something crashes it will take the whole VM down. Or if
you spend too much time in the C part it will block the scheduler from using the thread and endanger
the responsiveness of your system. Lunatic solves both of these problems. The reduction counter is
inserted before the WebAssembly code is JIT translated to machine code and will also be part of the
“native” C code, allowing the scheduler to preempt it. A crash still stays isolated thanks to
WebAssembly sandboxing properties.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end the chat server will remain a nice toy application and you should not use it for more
serious use cases as telnet doesn’t encrypt any of the data sent to the server.</p>
<p>However, it’s a really good feeling to get something like this running on a runtime you have built.
While developing the chat application I found a few bugs in the runtime itself, so it was totally
worth creating this app . I’m really looking forward to gradually moving away from building Lunatic
and building amazing applications with it. I was also positively surprised how well the chat app is
working, being the first real word app built on Lunatic.</p>
<p>I think that we are finally at the point where WebAssembly is mature enough to be used in serious
applications, and I strongly believe that WebAssembly on the backend …</p></section></div>

        <p>Intellij IDEA has been an amazing professional-grade IDE for the last 20 years. However, as computer programs evolve, so must the IDE keep pace to remain a useful tool.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>major IDE evolutions as I see:</p><p>2000s: using AST to represent text and building features around that. Intellij nailed this.</p><p>2010s: doing the same, but polyglot. Again Jetbrain's suite of IDEs adopted well in time.</p><p>2020s: support massive codebases across huge number of projects</p></div>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1337817841567899649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="what-s-changed">What's Changed?</h3><p>A typical organization in the 2020s has:</p><ol><li>Hundreds of microservices</li><li>Hundreds of git repos</li><li>Polyglot codebase</li><li>APIs defined with HTTP/JSON/GRPC, not just programming language interfaces</li><li>Runtime service inter-dependencies</li><li>Cloud service dependencies</li></ol><p>Let's go through how each of these could impact the design of the IDE of the future. I will be using Intellij for comparison since it's the most advanced IDE currently.</p><h3 id="big-code-is-the-new-big-data">Big Code is the new Big Data</h3><p>With huge amounts of code across hundreds or even thousands of repos, the IDE has to now deal with 'Big Code'. It's big not just due to the sheer lines of code. It's the fact that it's divided into microservices, each of which has a separate set of dependencies, which the IDE now has to separately index. This can exponentially increase the amount of code to index compared to a single large codebase without so many external dependencies like the Linux kernel.</p><p>All operations in the IDE must assume huge amounts of code across hundreds of repositories, not all of them might be checked out locally. So things like Refactoring, Find Usages, Call hierarchy, etc have to be re-architected to run as long-running operations over code that could be both local or remote and still give users a seamless experience.</p><h3 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3><p>Refactoring so far has really been a single repo feature. But what if the code you are refactoring is called by code in 100 other repos in your organization? What if those repos are not even checked out locally? The modern IDE needs to evolve beyond single repo operations. Maybe that rename refactoring now becomes a long-running operation that creates Pull Requests in various repos. This is not an easy problem to solve. Google even has a paper on this:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes and in large monorepos refactoring involves mapreduce operations <a href="https://t.co/yc92gX1qem">https://t.co/yc92gX1qem</a></p>— Nagesh Susarla (@nageshs) <a href="https://twitter.com/nageshs/status/1337843676324589568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The complexity grows as API calls happen across services in various languages now and use HTTP/JSON or GRPC/ProtoBuf. Renaming a <code>struct</code> in one repo that gets serialized to JSON during an http api call might require renaming a similar <code>struct</code> in a whole different language that deserializes said JSON. This is way more complex than a simple Java function rename refactoring.</p><h3 id="version-control-ui">Version Control UI</h3><p>Version Control features in IDEs are really built around browsing/editing one git repo at a time. This simply doesn't work when your codebase is spread across hundreds of repos. The fundamental interface for the Git UI in Intellij (and other IDEs) needs to be rethought to deal with a large number of repos.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Git Log view in <a href="https://twitter.com/intellijidea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@intellijidea</a> is poorly designed with respect to multiple repositories. You need to use the mouse to get to this dropdown list in the view. Then you need to first *deselect* the current repo and select your new repo. <br>Dont think this was dogfooded by the devs. <a href="https://t.co/lZ0YHdrUth">pic.twitter.com/lZ0YHdrUth</a></p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1349137311619981312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="rethinking-the-project-model">Rethinking the 'Project' model</h3><p>Currently, an <a href="http://astradot.com/">Astradot</a> engineer has to check out a git repo, eg <a href="https://github.com/astradot/kafka-schema-sync">https://github.com/astradot/kafka-schema-sync</a>, open the IDE, point to it, which will create an Intellij 'project' for the repo or a 'module' for an existing project. This is backward. The IDE should ask for the Github org eg, <a href="http://github.com/org">github.com/astradot</a> and it should create a single project that contains all the repo as modules. It should then manage lazy-loading/lazy-checkout or whatever is needed to give me a seamless experience browsing the code of my entire org.</p><h3 id="-run-button">'Run' button</h3><p>The 'Run' button will need to have more intelligence than simply running your app. In a microservice world, your service might depend upon an 'auth' service which might require a Postgres database and Redis instance initialized to some state. The services may rely on k8s service names to communicate, thus requiring running inside k8s. The IDE will need to be aware of the environment where you want to run your services and initialize the dependencies appropriately when you hit the 'Run' button.</p><p>The traditional debugger though is not going anywhere anytime soon. Take that from a guy who wrote a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpfmKIxusZY">time-traveling one</a>, once upon a time. Though IDEs could take a page from APMs and benefit from showing a distributed trace in addition to breakpoint-based debugging.</p><h3 id="what-s-not-the-future">What's not the future</h3><p>Silicon Valley has been obsessed with making 'IDE in the Cloud' happen for the last decade. Every year a new set of cloud IDE startups is funded while the old ones die off. None of the problems they are solving help professional engineers.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Annual IDE startup bingo card:</p><p>- Downgrade 'IDE' part from Intellij to VSCode but hey, it opens in browser!</p><p>- See every keystroke of other engineers - 'Collaboration/Live coding'</p><p>- Code runs in tiny ec2 instance with horsepower of 90s laptop instead of your 12 core AMD pc</p></div>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1363206351128723457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>From an <a href="http://astradot.com/">Astradot</a> engineer's perspective:</p><ul><li>Downloading and Installing Intellij is a non-issue</li><li>We have scripts to setup your workstation environment within minutes with all the needed compilers, tooling, etc.</li><li>We never need to see each other live code. That would be annoying/intruding on the other engineer's privacy.</li><li>Workstations are powerful enough that they can run the entire <a href="http://astradot.com/">Astradot</a> locally.</li></ul><p>We would love to buy all our engineers 64 core Threadrippers w 128Gb ram if the IDE could make use of it.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The IDE of the future is very different from what Intellij is today, both in terms of its architecture and UI. It requires solving some hard computer science problems. Jetbrains seems more focused on making just evolutionary changes to its IDEs to keep it ahead of VS Code. This is an opportunity for a new startup to rise.</p>

              <p>Along with the popular Functional Programming (FP) concepts such as purity or immutability, there is a significant one, which couldn’t boast much discussion around it — <strong>totality</strong>. Totality is an exceptionally interesting notion in the FP context. And you probably already use it and are aware of some pitfalls of not having totality in your code, but maybe the terminology doesn’t ring a bell.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we want to provide a comprehensive guide to the concept of totality in Functional Programming by demystifying its meaning, giving a lot of examples, and recommending how to get tools to help you write maintainable, testable code. You will find this blog post helpful if you are interested in understanding the fundamentals of FP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we will use Haskell to demonstrate and explain the totality, but the involved concepts apply to any programming language.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition<a href="#definition">🔗</a></h2>
<p><strong>Functions</strong> are core elements of Functional Programming. Functions are expressions that have a type that could be primitive or more complex. We can say that each function has an input, 0 or more arguments of some type and only one output, returning type. In other words, a function transforms its inputs to the output, and the function definition describes what actual work a function does to produce its result.</p>
<p>A function is <strong>total</strong> if it is defined for all inputs of its corresponding type, or in other words, if a function returns the output on any possible values of the input types.</p>
<p>For example, the following function that checks if the given integer is zero is total:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>isZero ::</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">isZero n <span>=</span> n <span>==</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above function is defined for any value of type <code>Integer</code>. No matter what it would receive as the argument, it will always return the answer – <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a function like “integral division” is <strong>partial</strong> (non-total). Though the division works perfectly on most of the inputs, the result of division by zero is not defined; therefore, there is an argument on which the function can’t return a reasonable result (and that’s why you may find the <code>isZero</code> function helpful). Partial functions are not defined on all their inputs and usually blow up when given something they cannot handle.</p>

</figure>
<p>The definition of totality originated in math. It has a similar formulation to what we provided above and could be understood in the same way.</p>
<p>Total function is a function defined for all elements in its domain. The domain is the set of x-values that can be put into a function. In other words, it’s the set of all possible values of the independent variable.</p>
<p>We can notice that the math function domain is the same as the input of our functions.</p>
<p>The following image is the canonical way to represent math functions, mapping values from domain A to values of range B. If it were a programming function, we would say that it maps type A to type B. Both total and partial way could be illustrated in that manner:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/totality/totality-math.png" alt="Totality in math">
</figure>
<p>However, despite all similarities, functions in programming are a bit different because they have a notion of <em>computation</em>.</p>
<p>Math doesn’t consider how long it takes for a function to calculate or how much memory it needs. Moreover, functions in programming can hang, and it is vital to keep this in mind when you write code.</p>
<p>Functions in math also don’t have side-effects, e.g.&nbsp;reading from file. But all these concerns are valid in the context of programming.</p>
<p>To summarise, here is a short list of possible things that functions in programming can do, and math functions cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hang (loop indefinitely or takes unreasonable time to compute)</li>
<li>Throw exceptions</li>
<li>Terminate before producing a result in case of insufficient memory</li>
<li>Have side-effects (read from files, send requests to web services, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional Programming is closer to the original math definition in the sense that its functions are pure – they have no side-effects. This essential FP paradigm allows us to talk about the concept of totality in a programming context, even though programming functions are very different from math functions.</p>
<h3 id="termination">Termination*<a href="#termination">🔗</a></h3>
<p><em>advanced section, could be skipped</em></p>
<p>As we look at totality from the programming point of view, we need to describe a very close concept to totality — <strong>termination</strong>. Termination gives the guarantee that function does produce a result in a finite amount of time. Usually, when people talk about <strong>total functional programming</strong>, they mean programming with <em>total</em> functions that <em>terminate successfully</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>This concept of termination is more relevant to advanced languages called <em>proof-assistants</em> used to write proofs as programming functions. In such languages, successful proof must be a total and terminating function. Proof-assistants are invaluable in the software verification areas.</p>
<p>However, in real-life software, not all functions must be total. For instance, a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) or a Web Backend are not supposed to terminate eventually on their own. They should run infinitely and respond to requests in a timely manner.</p>
<hr>
<p>The terminology of totality is a bit ambiguous in programming due to the different use-cases. In some places, total functions are required to terminate, while others require only to handle all inputs’ values. We will try to cover the most common definition of totality in this post.</p>
<p>Note as well that totality is not a straightforward and universally-applicable idea. We will make a few common simplifications in this post regarding totality in modern languages. But bear in mind that there are a lot of specifics that need to be kept in view. There are different methods of making functions total and guaranteeing this property for compiled vs interpreted, for typed vs untyped languages.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another aspect — <strong>laziness</strong>; it also affects the work of pure functions in different ways. Infinite functions could be total (with termination notion) due to laziness. For instance, the following recursive function produces an infinite list. And if you’ll try to print the resulting list to the terminal, you will wait indefinitely for this function to finish:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>multipliedByTwo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]</span>
<span id="cb2-2">multipliedByTwo x <span>=</span> x <span>:</span> multipliedByTwo (x <span>*</span> <span>2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, due to laziness, you still can take the first five elements of the list and get the result:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1">ghci<span>&gt;</span> <span>take</span> <span>5</span> (multipliedByTwo <span>3</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-2">[<span>3</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>12</span>, <span>24</span>, <span>48</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>If being absolutely honest, Haskell is not a total functional programming language by default. It has a special value called <em>“bottom”</em> (⊥) that can be passed to any pure function. When such a value is being evaluated, it throws a runtime error. You can use standard Haskell functions <code>undefined</code> or <code>error</code> at the bottom. It means that even the pure and total function <code>isZero</code> we defined above could fail in runtime if used on bottom elements:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">ghci<span>&gt;</span> isZero <span>undefined</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> Prelude.undefined</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">  <span>error</span>, called at libraries<span>/</span>base<span>/</span><span>GHC</span><span>/</span>Err.hs<span>:</span><span>79</span><span>:</span><span>14</span> <span>in</span> base<span>:</span><span>GHC.Err</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">  <span>undefined</span>, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>2</span><span>:</span><span>8</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"></span>
<span id="cb4-7">ghci<span>&gt;</span> isZero (<span>error</span> <span>"I'm a banana, I do what I wanna"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>I'm</span> a banana, <span>I</span> <span>do</span> what <span>I</span> wanna</span>
<span id="cb4-9"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10">  <span>error</span>, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>3</span><span>:</span><span>9</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To design a complete total system, we need to have the input set without bottom (⊥) elements. An example of pure total language is <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> — a configuration language where all functions must be pure, total and terminating.</p>
<p>If interested, you can read more about research in total functional programming (see in <a href="#links">Links</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>Usually, in FP, you don’t use the phrase “total function” as, by default, functions are considered to be total. However, this can’t be the case all the time; it would be too easy. There is an opposite concept of <em>totality</em> – <strong>partiality</strong>, which means that a function is <strong>not</strong> defined for all inputs of its type.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of common partial functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taking a list element by index.</strong> The index can be negative or be outside the list bounds, so it’s impossible to get the element in such cases.</li>
<li><strong>Parsing string to an integer.</strong> Not every string represents a valid numeric number, so a parsing function fails in such cases.</li>
<li><strong>Printf-like pretty-printing.</strong> If you specify the formatting with a separate string, it may fail at runtime on a wrong number of arguments or when types of arguments don’t match.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical functions</strong>: division by zero, square root of a negative number, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplication of matrices.</strong> If the dimensions of the two matrices are not aligned, it is impossible to multiply one matrix with another.</li>
<li>Laziness brings more interesting partiality cases to the table. When you can have infinite lists, functions like <code>sum</code>, <code>sort</code> or <code>reverse</code> become partial because they hang on infinite lists.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-should-we-care">Why should we care?<a href="#why-should-we-care">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As a developer, you have to deal with runtime exceptions all the time. Programming with total functions helps to avoid some of the runtime exceptions by ultimately preventing them from happening in the first place. But, at the same time, it requires time and discipline to write total functions. So you may think that writing total functions is a big price to pay for reducing the number of runtime exceptions since total functions won’t remove all exceptions entirely. But we believe that you actually should care about totality due to the few other perks as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even when writing a huge number of unit tests, you still can miss some cases. Total functional programming gives more guarantees about code correctness.</li>
<li>Debugging runtime exceptions can be tedious for developers. But users of buggy products are frustrated even more. Spending more time on making functions total pays off in the long run.</li>
<li>Total functional programming results in more maintainable, modular and composable programming. The composition of total functions is total. It means that you can refactor your code painlessly, split it into smaller and reusable parts, combine different components, and still be confident that it works. While working with partial functions, you may …</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<p>Have you ever wished that you could have type safe calculations throughout your application?<br>
Well through the use of F# Units of Measure (UoM), now you can!</p>

<p>In this post I will explore the various ways of using F# Units of Measure and the benefits they bring.<br>
Before I started writing this article, I had not used units of measure before. I therefore thought it would be a good idea to aid the learning process by applying them in a small project.
To do this, I decided to put UoM to the test by applying them in a real world example; The calculations required to brew beer.</p>

<p>What follows is a thorough walkthrough of using Units of Measure based upon my experiences while implementing a library of calculations for use in the various stages of brewing beer.<br>
I aim to highlight how, through the use of units of measure, we can increase the robustness of our code and hopefully eliminate potential runtime errors.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Units of Measure - An introduction</h2>

<p>Units of measure in F# are a type of metadata that can be associated with floating point or signed integer values.<br>
By associating a UoM with a quantity value it allows the F# compiler to perform additional type checking on the use of these units, enforcing relationships between units in arithmetic and reducing potential errors.</p>

<p>To declare a unit of measure you use the <code>[&lt;Measure&gt;]</code> attribute, followed by the <code>type</code> keyword and the name we want to give the measure.</p>

<p>For example, we can declare units of measure for some of the measures of volume we will need when calculating the ingredients in beer recipes.</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
<span>2: </span>
<span>3: </span>
<span>4: </span>
<span>5: </span>
</pre>
</td>
<td><pre><span>///Litre (or Liter in the US)</span>
[&lt;<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs9', 16)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs9', 16)">Measure</span>&gt;] <span>type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs13', 17)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs13', 17)">L</span>

<span>///Us Gallon</span>
[&lt;<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs9', 18)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs9', 18)">Measure</span>&gt;] <span>type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs14', 19)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs14', 19)">usGal</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Using a measure is as simple as annotating a float literal.</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
<span>2: </span>
</pre>
</td>
<td><pre><span>//Volume in litres</span>
<span>let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs15', 20)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs15', 20)">volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>120.0</span><span>&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs13', 21)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs13', 21)">L</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A value that has a unit of measure associated with it is said to have a <em>dimension</em> or be <em>dimensioned</em>.</p>

<p>Units of measure can be utilised in a number of ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>To constrain the values involved in calculations to particular measures</li>
<li>To provide type safe conversions between measures</li>
<li>For defining new units of measure in terms of the original</li>
<li>In types to create associations between different measures</li>
</ul>

<p>This is in no way a definitive list. They are just a few of the ways I found measures particularly beneficial during my time exploring there usage.<br>
If anyone has any other useful applications I would love to hear about them.</p>

<h2>Defining units of measure in terms of others</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it can be a useful technique to define a unit of measure in terms of other previously defined measures.<br>
Doing so allows us to use the <em>derived</em> measures in place of inferred results of calculations which can increase code clarity.</p>

<p>Let's take an example from the brewing process.</p>

<p>We often need to associate something called gravity points, with a volume of liquid.<br>
Gravity points are a very simplified definition of the amount of sugar in liquid. Obviously, this liquid could be in any number of units, and it is paramount that we ensure we do not mix measures of volume, for example, during recipe planning.</p>

<p>One common measurement used in home brewing circles is that of points per gallon (or points per pound per gallon - PPG) so let's define a measure for that.<br>
Firstly, we need to define a measure for gravity points.</p>

<p>Our <code>ppg</code> measure can now be used in our calculations, which we'll get to in a minute.<br>
But first, a few quick points on this type of measure.</p>

<ul>
<li>The formulas that represent the measures can be written in various equivalent ways. This sometimes manifests in the results of expressions being inferred differently than we would expect - more on this later.</li>
<li>Equivalent formulas are compiled into a common representation and can therefore be substituted freely.</li>
<li>You cannot use numeric values in these formulae. However, we can declare conversion constants which we will also explore later.</li>
<li>You can use <code>1</code> in these formulae. <code>1</code> represents a <em>dimensionless</em> value. I will touch on dimensionless values when discussing error prevention in the next section.</li>
</ul>

<p>These points and others are explained in detail on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233243.aspx">MSDN</a> page for Units of Measure.</p>

<h2>Using Units of Measure for error prevention</h2>

<p>Units of measure come in extremely handy for preventing us introducing errors into our code by using a value with an incorrect unit in a calculation or function.<br>
As an example taken from the world of brewing, we wouldn't want to mix up the units when making calculations about how much grain we need.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a function that can only take values with the specified dimensions.</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
<span>2: </span>
<span>3: </span>
</pre>
</td>
<td><pre><span>///Converts a points per gal (gp / usGal) and volume into total gravity points in that volume</span>

</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>As you can see, this function is declared with explicit type annotations specifying the dimensions of the parameters.<br>
The F# compiler will now prevent you from using this function with either dimensionless floats, or floats with the the wrong dimension (and of course, non float values).</p>

<p>Consider the following example where we attempt to call the function with dimensionless values:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
</pre>
</td>
<td><pre><span>let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs22', 38)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs22', 38)">totalGravPoints</span> <span>=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs18', 39)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs18', 39)">TotalGravityPoints</span> <span>240.0</span> <span>5.0</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Attempting to compile this line of code produces the following error notifying us that we haven't satisfied the type constraints and preventing us from introducing an error into our code.</p>

<div><pre lang="output">error FS0001: This expression was expected to have type
float&lt;gp/usGal&gt;    
    but here has type
float 
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise the compiler will stop us from passing different <code>UoM</code> to the function. 
Suppose we attempted to use a volume in Litres instead of the expected US Gallons.</p>

<p>We receive a similar error.</p>

<p>This example may be quite contrived, but it highlights the type safety provided by units of measure.
The F# compiler will also prevent us introducing arithmetic errors such as attempting to add/subtract a different or dimensionless unit from another.<br>
For instance, the following would not compile, returning the errors shown.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>A dimensionless value can either be declared simply with no measure, as above, or with the explicit measure of <code>1</code> like so:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
</pre>
</td>
<td><pre><span>let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs15', 50)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs15', 50)">volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>5.0</span><span>&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs14', 51)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs14', 51)">usGal</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>5.0</span><span>&lt;</span><span>1</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<div><pre lang="output">//result
error FS0001: The type 'float' does not match the type 'float&lt;usGal&gt;'
</pre></div>

<p>Although we cannot add/subtract different or dimensionless values from an already dimensioned value, we can multiply or divide them.<br>
Multiplying or dividing by a dimensionless value will result in same measure, however using a different measure in the calculation will result in a different (potentially new) measure.</p>

<p>This brings us nicely to our next section.</p>

<h2>Effects of multiplication and division</h2>

<p>By multiplying or dividing a value that either has a measure already, or is dimensionless, we can create new units of measure.<br>
The result of this process is effectively to <em>combine</em> two different units of measure (remember, a dimensionless value can be thought of as having a measure of 1).</p>

<p>We have already declared a unit of measure that can be used to demonstrate this, our <code>ppg</code> measure.<br>
A <code>ppg</code> value is simply a <code>gp</code> value divided by a <code>usGal</code> value.</p>

</pre>
</td>

</tbody></table>

<p>The value of pointsPerGallon above is just what we would expect.</p>

<div><pre lang="output">val pointsPerGallon : float&lt;gp/usGal&gt; = 48.0
</pre></div>

<p>The exact same principle works for multiplication too and don't forget, two or more units of measure can be considered equal.</p>

<h2>Type inference and measure equality</h2>

<p>Lets take the following function as an example;</p>

<p>The F# compiler correctly infers that the result of this function is of the type <code>float&lt;gp/usGal&gt;</code> (hover over the function above to see this)</p>

<p>We also know that equivalent measures are interchangeable.<br>
This means, we could alternatively declare this function as returning a <code>&lt;ppg&gt;</code> measure explicitly like so.</p>

<p>The F# type system will allow us to use either of these functions where the alternative dimension is required (i.e. a <code>ppg</code> where a <code>gp/usGal</code> is expected).
I did find however, that in certain situations, it can make code much clearer to be explicit about the return type.</p>

<p>Consider the following example where we use a <code>pgp</code> measure instead of the <code>gp/lb</code> for the grainPotential:</p>

<p>If you look at the inferred return type of this function you will see it is <code>float&lt;lb pgp/usGal&gt;</code>.<br>
While this is perfectly correct, it can be confusing.</p>

<p>We can clearly see that the <code>pgp</code> measure is equivalent to that of <code>gp…</code></p></div></div>

				<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/l99.jpg" alt="Robot"></p>
<p>At the time of writing this article, I’ve been living without social media for 3 years and without a smartphone for 2 years. Everything started as an experiment motivated by my privacy concerns. I ended up living like that for an entire different reason: peace of mind. You can find a lot of people on internet that have tried this experiment, from a couple of days to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0RVWU_nROk">entire month</a>. However I discovered that the brain dependencies created by social media and smartphones take a lot longer to go away (30 days for me). You can’t really see the effects it has on your life unless you try this kind of experiment for a long time, because you will be stuck in the withdrawal phase that makes you crave dopamine.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, I do not live in a cave where I spend my time coding without any social life, sorry guys ;) I did this experiment while having a busy professional and personal life: I traveled around the world, moved to a new city without knowing anyone, ran <a href="https://www.duple.io/">my own software startup</a>, met new people and made new friends, etc… So it is possible to live your life the same way, or even better, without a smartphone or social media.</p>
<p>I will share with you my experience leaving social media and my smartphone, the tools I replaced them with, some tips and tricks, people’s reactions to my experiment, as well as some funny anecdotes.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start-with-why">Let’s Start With Why</h2>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>The original motivation behind this experiment was privacy. I’m a professional hacker, the things I can do are scary and I’m far from being the only one with these skills. <strong>Smartphones are a dream come true for people like me, little spy devices that are 24/7 on you, remotely accessible from anywhere around the world</strong>. Throw social media into the equation, and you can get inside the head of anybody, and make them do whatever you want. Yes, you should be scared. And that’s even without mentioning all the other <a href="https://lithub.com/what-does-privacy-really-mean-under-surveillance-capitalism/">privacy</a> and <a href="https://the.ink/p/we-can-have-democracy-or-we-can-have">freedom</a> issues that come with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">social media</a> and <a href="https://nrkbeta.no/2020/12/03/my-phone-was-spying-on-me-so-i-tracked-down-the-surveillants/">smartphones</a>.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
<p>Another reason, which is less dark, was curiosity. I like to experiment and try new things in my life. I was curious about the idea of living without a smartphone and social media especially in a world more connected than ever. And if I didn’t like the experiment, I could always go back to <a href="https://www.meta-nomad.net/avoiding-the-global-lobotomy/">zombieland</a>.</p>
<h3 id="planned-obsolescence">Planned Obsolescence</h3>
<p>The cherry on top was to stop paying each year for a new smartphone, that does nothing more than the previous one, just because the providers decided to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">sabotage old models</a> so they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batterygate">stop working</a>.</p>
<h3 id="peace-of-mind">Peace of mind</h3>
<p>This is for me the most important reason (even though I discovered it afterwards). The positive effects on your mind, being free from social media and smartphones, are incredible. More on it later.</p>

<p>In 2018 I deleted my accounts from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. No coming back, no temptation to reactivate them later on. I kept LinkedIn on standby for professional use although it came close to being deleted as well. WhatsApp got replaced by <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> because Facebook bought them, plus <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/">they’re not really big fan s of privacy</a>.</p>
<p>During that year I kept my smartphone, as I wanted to do the experiment gradually. This decision allowed me to discover something quite counter intuitive about social media and smartphones (more on it later).</p>
<p>From that point on I was reachable by SMS, call, email and Signal. I wasn’t ready for what happened next. Fasten your seatbelts.</p>
<h3 id="people-thought-i-was-dead">People Thought I Was Dead</h3>
<p>The first reaction people had was to think something bad had happened to me, some of them even thought I was dead. Then something socially curious happened: everybody started speaking to each other on Facebook and WhatsApp to try to figure out what was wrong. Some of them even contacted my family multiple times. They all had my phone number, email address and other ways of contacting me. <strong>However, none of them did</strong>. It was like I had exited the matrix, and was living in another reality.</p>
<h3 id="trustworthiness">Trustworthiness</h3>
<p>I was told that I couldn’t be trusted since people can’t check online what I’m doing when I’m not around.</p>
<p>Yeah, you read that right.</p>
<p><strong>Society has been brainwashed to believe that privacy is something criminal. Sorry to disappoint, but privacy is a basic fundament of freedom and democracy. That’s why the voting system is anonymous</strong> [1]. When people tell you “<a href="https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide">If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear</a>”, what they really mean is “democracy is overrated, get over it”.</p>
<p><em>[1] Privacy: you know who I am but not what I do. Anonymity: You know what I do but not who I am. The voting system uses both, privacy when you go vote, anonymity when they count the results.</em></p>
<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<p>This was for me the biggest problem. <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">Getting people out of WhatsApp</a> if they wanted to talk to me created a lot of friction. Some of them even stopped texting me because they had to open another app on their phone in order to write to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you also read that right.</p>
<p>I don’t miss WhatsApp, nor do I miss its endless group talks without anything useful. If you leave one of these groups people look at you as if you did something wrong. In the end I still had access to all the event’s information I needed despite them being organized on WhatsApp. In regards to this, not having the app didn’t change my life much.</p>
<p>A trick I’ve developed, when giving my contact info to new people, is to enter my phone number on their smartphone myself, and install Signal for them. This removed a lot of friction. I would then explain my experiment to them and tell them I can only be contacted via this app. I’ve always had a positive reaction. Everybody’s been curious and asking a lot of questions.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-nothing-happened">And Then Nothing Happened</h3>
<p>During the first weeks without social media, I felt off. As if I was missing out on something big that was happening. Like everybody was having fun except me. Once the <a href="https://joshcsimmons.com/quit-social-media/">withdrawal phase</a> went away, I realized that my life hadn’t changed that much. I was still doing the same things, talking to the same people, going to the same parties, etc… It was just more quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>I was no longer bombarded with pictures of everybody trying to fake a life they’re not living for the sole purpose of impressing someone else: <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel">my life had just upgraded</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In the end, after everybody got over their initial shock and calmed down, it became normal for them to contact me using Signal, and life went on as usual.</p>
<h2 id="round-2-goodbye-smartphone">Round 2: Goodbye Smartphone</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/l99-2.jpg" alt="Phone"></p>
<p>Unlike social media, smartphones are a lot harder to get rid off. They handle many more things than just simply communicating with people.  I work all day long with a computer, most of what the smartphone was doing could be handled by my laptop. For the rest, I narrowed down my bare essential to Music, Pictures, GPS navigation and of course GSM calls.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>
<p>You could solve these problems quite easily using multiple devices, however I wanted to be smart about it and not walk around with a luggage just to carry around all this stuff. After doing some research I figured out the perfect combination and I was even able to reduce the amount of things I had in my pockets.</p>

Gone are the awkward transitions (“hold on, let me connect my AirPods”) while fiddling with your Bluetooth settings and pressing that random button on the white case.</p><p>Now you can gracefully glide from podcast, to Zoom call, to Discover Weekly, to Clubhouse, to audiobooks while enlisting Siri’s help. <strong>Seamlessly and without interruption.</strong></p><p>Yet it turns out that our headphones have been following us for much longer than a MacOS update.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5273e2a669bedd7c06afe99f?width=1100&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp" alt="Image result for original ipod add" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><p>Remember that original promise <strong>“1,000 songs in your Pocket?”</strong> <em>That was 20 years ago.</em></p><p><strong>“All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,”</strong> wrote the 17th century philosopher Blaise Pascal. Yet thanks to these white little earbuds, we never need to spend that quiet time alone.</p><hr><p>Do all of life’s moments need to be productive moments?</p><p>To answer that question, let’s distinguish between two types of activities: <strong>telic </strong>and<strong> atelic.</strong></p><p>Stemming from the Greek term <em>Telos </em>(“Having an inherent purpose”), <strong>telic activities</strong> are directed towards an end goal. Conversely, <strong>atelic</strong> activities are pursued for their own sake.</p><p>Telic activities include writing a novel, learning a new skill and building a house all have <strong>specific outcomes. </strong></p><p>On the other hand atelic activities – going for a walk, a long talk with friends, making love, and listening to your favorite songs – <strong>have no end goal.</strong> You derive joy from the activity itself.</p><p>Here’s the rub. <strong>Atelic activities are not “productive.”</strong></p><p>You do not move yourself closer to your goals when you do a puzzle with your toddler. Or when you pause to observe the beauty of a sunset. <strong>These aren’t productive activities.</strong></p><p>And since my Type-A self finds these activities very uncomfortable, my brain does a little mental <strong><em>jiu jitsu</em></strong> to make them more comfortable. I call them <em>Telic Transformations.</em></p><p>As I watch Soul with the fam, I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/khemaridh/status/1342864974771732480">processing ideas</a> for upcoming blog posts. (And when I watch Toy Story, looking to identify the <em>Hero’s Journey </em>narrative arc.)</p><p>When I surf, I’m constantly thinking of the next maneuver to learn (<em>cutbacks</em>), or the next board I could buy.</p><p>Heck, even when sitting on the John (without an iPhone), I’ll grab one of the cleaning products and look for examples of good copy, logo design, or color pairings.</p><p>As Pascal says, those quiet moments with myself can be <strong>quite uncomfortable.</strong></p><p>And then there’s the ultimate telic transformation: <strong>the podcast.</strong></p><p>Thanks to this venerable audio format, the last bastion of atelic activities (a beach walk, cooking a family dinner, getting your kids to sleep) can become <strong>instantly productive</strong> with the most recent episode of <em>The Tim Ferriss show.</em></p><p>Now this isn’t a critique against learning. Nor one against continuous self-improvement. Or about pursuing one’s insatiable curiosity.</p><p>But isn’t this pull to turn <strong>everything</strong> <strong>into an</strong> <strong>outcome</strong> quite peculiar?</p><p>And here comes a conundrum. Telic activities end. Yet the desire lives on. So we <a href="https://radreads.co/when-then-trap/">move the goal line</a>. Another goal. Another outcome.</p><p>And one starts laying the bricks for the hedonic treadmill.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-philosophy-of-the-midlife-crisis">The Philosophy of the Midlife Crisis</a>, the philosopher Kieran Setiya writes that “there’s something intrinsically self-defeating about getting things done.” Once you do the thing, it can’t be done again. Setiya continues:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Having a child, writing a book, saving a life—the completion of your project may be of value, but it means that the project can no longer be your guide. In pursuing a goal, you are trying to exhaust your interaction with something good, as if you were to make friends for the sake of saying goodbye.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Setiya concludes that “being consumed by plans” can be problematic:</p><blockquote><p><em>“They are schemes for which success can only mean cessation.”</em></p></blockquote><p>We’re not human doings. We’re human beings. Personally, I suspect that my <em>telic transformations</em> come from a place of fear. The fear of not <em>doing enough</em>, comes from the fear of <em>not being enough</em>. Confusing <a href="https://radreads.co/identity-achievement/">identity and achievement</a> becomes a slippery slope that robs me from the present and the beauty and love that surround me.</p><p>So I’ll heed Pascal’s advice – and ditch the AirPods during my next beach walk.</p> </div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <div><p>The venture capital industry was built on the premise that both capital and high quality companies are scarce. For most of the history of the industry, this has been true. I remember sitting at demo day in 2011 and marveling at the fact that the combined capital of all the VCs in the room was less than that controlled by the hedge fund at which I had worked. But the model is wrong. Venture capital is abundant, and that fact should fundamentally change how founders fundraise.<br></p><p>This scarcity model has shaped the structure of startups and VCs - most of what an early stage startup does is designed to convince a VC to invest. Companies treat VCs as a limited resource that is both hard to access and hard to convince. Investors do their best to perpetuate this idea because it allows them to retain control of the pitch and fund dynamic.[1]</p><p>Something interesting happens, though, whenever a company has a signifier of quality - a YC demo day slot, a high quality angel, pedigreed founders, or, even better, strong growth. In these cases, there are investor feeding frenzies, leading to oversubscribed rounds, ever climbing prices, and investors willing to accept ownership targets they - until recently - would have termed unacceptable.</p><p>To be sure, there have always been bidding wars in private equity (of which venture is a subset), but these bidding wars are so frequent now as to be approaching the norm. If capital was actually scarce, this wouldn’t happen, there wouldn’t be enough money to create so many bidding wars.[2]</p><p>Bidding wars aren’t the only evidence of capital abundance. The VCs are changing their businesses because of this abundance, whether or not they admit the reason. The evidence is in the new funds that seem to launch on a daily basis, the multi-billion dollar growth funds that have become increasingly common, and the ownership targets at various rounds that continue to drop.</p><p>At the same time that capital has become more abundant, founders have become smarter about fundraising. There are now a huge number of blogs, classes, essays, guides, and advisers ready to help founders navigate the previously opaque world of fundraising. As a result, founders can approach each funding event with a clear plan of how to run a process. Running an orderly process further increases the chances that a company will see competitive bids.</p><p>As a thought experiment, assume that the abundance model is here to stay. It is also safe to assume that founders will not suddenly forget their newfound knowledge about process. I think this should encourage founders to think about changing fundraising in a few major ways:</p><ol>
<li><p>Founders should approach every fundraising as an auction. This is what each process already is, but the auction is inefficient. There’s lots of language and pseudo-moral arguments about why this is bad, but most of those fall apart if capital is abundant.</p></li>
<li><p>Founders should expand their funnels beyond the traditional VCs. These VCs hold a marketing and branding advantage, much of which is built around the signal to later rounds. If, however, each round is an auction, this benefit evaporates. YC’s demo day proved this funnel expansion works at seed, and there’s no logical reason it should fail at later rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a founder has the information produced by this process, she can decide whether to minimize dilution, maximize price, or optimize around the partner. The answer will change based on the situation, but having access to the choice is important.</p></li>
</ol><p>Founders are hesitant to run this model because they fear that running an auction will create a negative quality signal. Investors encourage this belief because it allows them to keep deal flow proprietary. This is flawed logic. The quality of a company can’t be determined by the investors to whom that company talks when raising money. The quality of a company is determined by whether or not the company is good, and good companies should take advantage of abundant capital markets.[3]</p><p><i>Thanks to Adora Cheung, Janelle Tam, Ilya Sukhar, and Nabeel Hyatt for helping me think this through, even though our conclusions might differ.<br></i></p><p>__</p><p>[1] Perhaps more importantly to the investors’ business model is that this dynamic creates a reason for the existence of VCs. If founders and LPs both internalized how non-scarce capital actually is, they could find one another directly, bypassing VCs.</p><p>[2] It’s important to remember that, even though capital is abundant, it remains unevenly distributed. There are companies that struggle to raise money - some of these may be bad investments, but many are good. This is a problem of access rather than capacity, which is a whole different issue.</p><p>[3] When a company IPOs, it opens ownership up to anyone who can afford a share. Imagine, for a second, an investor arguing that this is a sign of low quality.</p></div>

</div><div>
<div data-contentpath-field="block">
<h3>Clinical Need</h3><p>COVID-19 is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. One reason for this is that COVID-19 causes a spectrum of disease ranging from mild infection to critical illness, and its hard for doctors to anticipate which COVID-19 patients will need more immediate medical attention.</p><p>Having a prediction tool would allow hospitals to quickly triage coronavirus patients into high and low risk levels. In this way, hospital resources can be more adequately allocated to the higher risk coronavirus patients.</p><h3>What did they do?</h3><p>They looked back at blood test results from coronavirus patients in Tangji Hospital in Wuhan, China. They used the latest blood tests to train a machine learning model to predict one of two outcomes: death or survival.</p>
</div>
<div data-contentpath-field="block">

<h3>How was the model made?</h3><p>The group used a popular <sample>classification model</sample> called XGBoost 🤖</p>
</span>
</p>
<div data-contentpath-field="right">

<p>In machine learning, classification is a technique that categorises data into a given number of classes. These classes can have any sort of label e.g. cancer or no cancer. A classification model attempts to reach a conclusion about the input values during training by assigning the input to one of the classes.</p>

<p>This is a type of <sample>decision tree ensemble</sample>.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div data-contentpath-field="right">

<p>Ensemble Learning is a powerful method of Machine Learning that trains and predicts with many models (ie many decision trees) at once to produce a single superior output.</p><p>Think of it as trying out a few different routes to a single location you’ve never been to; as you use all of the routes, you begin to learn which traffic lights take longer, when and how the time of day impacts one route over the other — allowing you to craft the perfect route. You experimented with and combined a few different models to reach an optimal conclusion. Ensemble learning is similar!</p>

<div data-contentpath-field="block">
<p>The model output was set as either class 0 (death) or class 1 (survival).</p><p>As is usual for training classification models, the model was trained by comparing its predictions to the true outcomes of over 300 respective patients and then altering its decision steps accordingly.</p><p>Eventually, the trained model was tested on a separate set of patient data (the test set), from 110 new patients.</p>
</div>
<div data-contentpath-field="block">

<p><span data-contentpath-field="block">
<h3>How did the model do?</h3><p>The algorithm performed well 🎯. On the test set, it achieved an <sample>F1 score of 0.98</sample> for predicting survival and 0.90 for predicting death.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div data-contentpath-field="right">

<p>This is a score for assessing how well the model is making the correct prediction, ranging from 0 (really bad) to 1 (really good). It balances precision (if the algorithm makes a prediction, how confident can we be?) with sensitivity (of the outcome of interest, how many did it pick up correctly?)</p>

<p>They found F1 scores were highest when blood tests were taken close to the day of final outcome (death or survival). Even as far as 18 days before final outcome, the cumulative F1 scores were over 0.90.</p><h3>Want the nitty gritty? 🧐</h3><p>XGBoost is a type of tree ensembling method. It generates many different 'decision trees' then aggregates them together.</p><p>An advantage is that this can be very interpretable. The team produced two simple rules that would predict death in this population:</p><ol><li>LDH &gt; 365 or</li><li>hs-CRP &gt;41.2 and Lymphocyte &lt;14.7%</li></ol>
</div>
<div data-contentpath-field="block">
<h3>Where it all went wrong 😬</h3><p>The group didn't validate their model externally i.e. in another hospital. This is crucial when developing a model as it reduces overfitting of the model to one specific dataset. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00254-2">Another group</a> tested the model in New York and the F1 score for predicting death was 0.41. Similarly low accuracy was reported in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00252-4">France</a> and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00253-3">Netherlands</a>.</p><p>Also, this model's accuracy depended on how close to the final outcome it was applied. In real-life, doctors wouldn't know when the final outcome will happen.</p><p>The group didn't make it clear whether the model can be used as a triage tool at the first point of presentation to hospital. When the New York group applied the model at initial triage point, the F1 score for predicting death was still low, at 0.56.</p><p>(These performance issues are not confined to this particular model. A <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/56/6/2003498">review</a> of existing predictive models for COVID-19 found that none of them met the standard of accuracy that you get from simpler measures like oxygen levels. The review recommended that, in future, model developers must always externally validate their models.)</p><h3>So what?</h3><p>This paper made a lot of waves in the few months after it came out, with several direct replies and over 90 citations. There's clearly a lot of interest in predictive models for COVID-19. However, with the limitations highlighted above, it's unlikely that this exactly model will be used on a widespread scale.</p>

      <p>TL;dr If you wish to create your own Stripe Open Payment Link, like Paypal.me, you can use <a href="https://tillypay.com/">tillypay.com</a></p><p>One killer feature that Stripe hasn't made is a response to PayPal.me, this would be when the end client or user could enter the amount and continue to pay that amount.</p><p>It would be great if you could have the option to do this, so we built it! TillyPay is a verified Stripe Partner, this means we can control your Stripe platform on your behalf adding this much needed <strong>Open Pay Link</strong>. We call it OpenPay.</p><h3 id="introducing-openpay">Introducing OpenPay</h3><p>OpenPay will allow your customers to write in exactly <strong>amount</strong> they wish to pay and in the <strong>currency</strong> they wish to pay in.</p><p>You also operate this under your <strong>own domain</strong> rather than using ours.<br><strong>pay.yourcompany.com/open</strong> could lead to the page like below:</p><figure><img src="https://tillypay.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-05-at-12.21.12.png"><figcaption>Example of an Open Payment Link for Stripe</figcaption></figure><p>The payment will be entered and created into your existing Stripe dashboard.</p><p><strong>Payment Methods</strong><br>We allow any payment method that Stripe uses, including Apple &amp; Google Pay, you can see this above under the "Pay Now&gt;" button will lead them to any system that they currently have installed on their system.</p><p>This is a lot more variety than PayPal's system, under business transactions this solution is cheaper.</p><h2 id="free-to-try-out">Free to try out</h2><p>To get started with TillyPay's OpenPay system, head over to our web app and get started</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href="https://app.tillypay.com/signup?utm_source=blog-openpay">

	<h2>Let's build a Complementary Color Scheme!</h2>
	<img src="http://tallys.github.io/color-theory/images/color-circle.png" alt="color-wheel" title="color wheel" description="the color wheel with corresponding hsl degrees">
	<p>This is the color wheel, consider this the documentation for using color. <br> Notice that the degrees on the color wheel correspond to colors.</p>
	
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Pick a color <span> hsl($hue, $saturation, $lightness)</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		<p>Pick any color by selecting its hue (0-360) on the color wheel at full saturation (100%) and at half lightness (50%) - this way you start with the 'most colorful color' you can get.</p>
		<p>This is what your website will look like if you set every element to this one color. Notice how you can't tell one item from another. Color is information.</p>

	</div>
	<div>
		
		<div>
			<p>Why pick a fully saturated color, but only half lightness?</p>
			<p>Ever mix up a bunch of colors only to end up with a gray blob? In the real world, you can't mix a color to be more saturated - you only "lose" color information as you mix. So, the practice is to start with the most saturated colors at their most chromatic so you can still have a full range of mixing opportunities.</p>

<section>
	<h2>Generate Complementary Color<span>complement( );</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		<p>Generate your second color without having to guess what will work. Thanks to science and wavelengths, we know that this works. The opposition of these two colors stimulate your photoreceptor cells in a good way!</p>
		<p>Finally! A different color - now hue separates elements from each other and a layout can be seen.</p>

	</div>
	<div>
		
		<p>The complement to any color is always 180 degrees across on the other side of the color wheel. If you've ever wondered why it's the color wheel instead of a color line, this is part of that answer. Remember that the color wheel is our visual documentation for color relationships. <br> Fun fact, if you mix complementary colors, they'll cancel each other out and you'll end up with a neutral gray.</p>

<section>
	<h2>Color Relationship Established by Mixing<span>harmonious-mix( );</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		
		<p>Establish a color relationship by mixing them together. This makes the colors look like they're under similar lighting conditions.</p>
		<p>Here, you see less saturated hues, with a clear relationship between each other.</p>

				<p>Our eyes may be legacy systems, but they are really good at spotting patterns, especially things that look like they don't belong in a set.</p>
				<p>This mixing method is another way we can simulate lighting and color found in nature. It's a bit more complicated, but my favorite way of explaining it is this: Everything outside has some "yellow" mixed in from the sunshine during the day. Same thing happens when everyone and everything looks bad in photos taken under the glow of green flourescent lights - there is green added to all of the colors you're looking at, including adding a green glow to your skin if you're standing under the flourescent light yourself. Whether it looks good or bad, this color (light) mixing creates a visual harmony. We don't really notice it when it's there, but we really notice its absence.</p>
				<p>When you're painting, you want to simulate similar lighting conditions for a scene, and that effect is accomplished mixing a bit of one color into the other. Mixing different ratios of the same colors will usually generate a matching color palette.</p>
				<p>How do I decide what to do? Thanks to art school and science, I know that cool colors have lower luminosity than warm colors, and will dominate in mixes, with yellow being the lightest color. For example, a touch of blue will really affect yellow, whereas you can add a lot of yellow to blue before it is affected. So, here is this decision making in function form - I am weighing different colors differently when mixing.</p>

	<h2>Create Neutrals<span>mix-neutral( ); lighten( ); darken( );</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		
		
		<p>Let your chosen color pop (in other words, don't exhaust your eyes by making them process non-stop intense chromatic colors!) by surrounding it with neutrals. Desaturate the painter way: by mixing complementary colors! Then, vary that neutral's lightness to create a highlight and a shadow.</p>
		<p>Making the complementary color neutrals will help the 'call to action' color you selected stand out - notice how much the button in the top right "pops" all of a sudden. Make things "pop" by making other things around them not pop.</p>

	<div>
		
		
		
		<p>We can do the same for our primary color too. More neutrals to work with.</p>
		<p>Doesn't it seem like we went too far with this whole making things neutral? Now, nothing "pops"! But, on the plus side, none of this seems to be irritating any eyeballs, either. Remember that our eyes don't like to handle seeing everything our computers are capable of rendering.</p>

			<p>The colors are way too intense at their full saturation for our eyes to handle. If all the colors are bright, none of the colors are bright.</p>
			<p>I picked my starting color for a reason -  I want that to be the heart of my design! That means the complementary color should support the chosen color, and we do that by mixing neutrals. Our eyes don't really handle saturated colors very well next to other saturated colors. Our eyes get confused at the edges - is it this color or the other one? Ahh both! We end up seeing optical illusions. Just give your eyes a break between super strong saturated colors with neutrals so they don't stress out about that much visual information. At the very minimum a rule of thumb is that your viewport should have 33% neutral space (white, desaturated, or black colors) so your poor eyes can have a break and process the information right. Otherwise you get eye strain!</p>

<section>
	<h2>Why not just desaturate?<span>mix-neutral( ); lighten( ); darken( );</span></h2>
		<p>You totally can! Desaturate does a great job. But, I think not only is it important to understand what "desaturate" means. How would you desaturate a real color in the real world? Remember, you want "ugly" colors for your neutrals! You want to create bland and forgettable colors that recede into the background. These ugly duckling colors are how you get those other call to actions and buttons "pop"!</p>

		<h3>Primary and complementary Colors</h3>
			
			
		<h3>Mixed neutrals</h3>
			
			


		<h3>Desaturated neutrals</h3>
			
			

		<div>
			
			<p>Even though these may look "ugly", neutral colors are the heart of any painting, and that is the case on the web, too. Notice that the same decisions are …</p></div></section></div>

<p><span>I</span>t’s the kind of picture that most Facebook users would scroll by without pause: the sun hanging low in a blue sky, half-hidden by the silhouette of a tent. “Donate [for the sake of Allah] to free your imprisoned sisters,” a line of embedded text reads, with the hashtag #CampHol. “Contact to help us,” the caption adds, including the name of a Telegram account.</p>



<p>Even a user who did take the time to look closer might assume the post was related to an Islamic charity or perhaps a fundraiser for human trafficking victims, then move on. Its intended audience, however, would immediately recognize the link to ISIS.</p>



<p>Al-Hol refugee camp in Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria is home to the women and children who lived in ISIS’s last remaining pockets of territory before they were retaken by the Syrian Democratic Forces in March 2019. The majority of residents are Iraqi and Syrian, but there is also a separate annex for women who traveled to live in the so-called caliphate. These women, some of whom emigrated from Europe, Asia, and Africa, are seen by locals as more fanatical than those in other parts of the camp. A United Nations <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syrian-arab-republic-north-east-syria-al-hol-camp-21-november-2019">report</a> from November 2019 found that foreigners made up 15% of the camp’s total population of 70,000, although some have since been repatriated or moved to more secure facilities.</p>



<p>A sprawling mass of dusty tents surrounded by fences and armed guards, al-Hol’s foreigners’ annex has become a place of radicalization and extremism. There, hard-line Islamists have reimposed ISIS’s draconian rules <strong>—</strong> any woman or girl over eight must be fully veiled in black; communication with authorities or journalists is forbidden; daily prayer is mandatory —<strong> </strong>and been known to beat and murder transgressors. With resources already overextended, the camp staff have little ability to intervene.</p>



<p>Last year, online fundraisers began to appear on behalf of al-Hol residents. Many were seeking to finance escapes, others to pay for food and supplies. (While some donations have likely gone toward terrorism, the campaigns are careful to avoid mentioning violence.) The petitions spread via social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and often involved PayPal and other payment systems as well as messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Telegram. Before long, intelligence and law enforcement agencies began to monitor them.</p>

<p>Media reports followed, and any platform that was not already aware of the campaigns’ existence was soon clued in. Even so, several months later, this kind of content remains relatively easy to find. <em>Rest of World </em>was able to identify dozens of Facebook accounts claiming to be linked to al-Hol, many of which post comments glorifying ISIS or soliciting funds. “Do not fear the imprisonment of the [unbelievers] for helping your sisters,” reads one, inviting supporters to message privately for more information. On Instagram, an account consisting mostly of images and videos from al-Hol included a picture of a figure clad all in black holding up a cardboard sign. It reads, “WE ARE TWO SISTERS FROM CAMP AL HOL AND WE ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE … WE COLLECTED 13,000$ AND WE NEED 3000$ PLEASE WE BEG THE UMMAH TO HELP US AND DONATE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.” Below, a caption elaborating on the message is translated into Turkish, English, Russian, and French.</p>



<p>Accounts like these often remain active for months. This is possible, in part, because campaigns extend across multiple networks and payment platforms, creating a complex and opaque ecosystem that sometimes mixes illegal payment solicitations with requests for legitimate charitable giving. As major social media companies scramble to figure out policies around hate speech and disinformation, ISIS-related fundraisers have continued to slip through.</p>

<p><strong>In the more</strong> than five years that ISIS held territory in Iraq and Syria, it generated vast sums of money — from oil fields, plundering banks, drug and artifact smuggling, taxing people living under its regime, and taking hostages. The French government alone was <a href="http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/krise-in-der-arabischen-welt/syrien/paris-zahlt-loesegeld-18-millionen-dollar-fuer-entfuehrte-journalisten_id_3800633.html">reported</a> to have paid an $18 million ransom to secure the release of four journalists. (A government spokesman denied this account.)</p>



<p>Although the revenues generated by online campaigns are minuscule in comparison, they are not insignificant — Audrey L. Alexander, a researcher and instructor at West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center, told <em>Rest of World</em> that she regularly encounters crowdfunding efforts by terrorists, some of which bring in as much as $2,000 — and this income likely helps keep ISIS activities going. It’s impossible to say with any certainty how much ISIS receives in online donations, but the money has been linked to escapes, weapons purchases, and propaganda produced by al-Hol-linked accounts, which have replaced the high-production-value videos once released by ISIS’s media arm.</p>

<p>In a March <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/13/2002298979/-1/-1/1/LIG_OIR_Q2_MAR2020_GOLD_508_0513.PDF">report</a> to Congress, the American-led coalition against ISIS, Operation Inherent Resolve, detailed how women within the camps, and particularly al-Hol, have built up a network for smuggling people and supplies, while simultaneously recruiting and indoctrinating new members. “Using funds received via wire transfers,” the authors noted, “female ISIS members continued to conduct operations — such as attacks against camp security personnel.” While this amplified existing pressure on social media companies to better monitor their platforms, it didn’t appear to have any major policy impacts.</p>



<p>The architects of these networks tailor their messages and methods to geography, specific donors and goals, and national laws and platform regulations. Of the Facebook accounts identified by <em>Rest of World</em> that claim links to al-Hol, only some explicitly asked for donations. Others disseminated pictures or news from the camp in different languages, alongside Islamic scripture and memes. A few users fondly reminisced about their time in the caliphate. Facebook disables and deletes accounts that share terrorist propaganda, so ISIS was never explicitly mentioned. Instead, references to the organization were camouflaged by alternative spellings. “I miss the Dawl@,” one said, with a crying emoji, referencing the Arabic word for “state” in ISIS’s full name.</p>



<p>Facebook says it has been making major investments to combat the proliferation of terrorist content on its platform. Much of that relies on AI and on media-matching software that finds images, text, or videos that are either identical or near identical to content that has already been taken down. Once identified, they are removed nearly instantly.</p>



<p>“Facebook has no tolerance for terrorist propaganda or content fundraising for terrorist groups. We take this extremely seriously and we are investing heavily to keep people safe,” a spokesperson told <em>Rest of World</em> in an emailed statement. “Over the last few years we’ve tripled the size of our safety and security team to 35,000 and built artificial intelligence technology to find and remove this content before people see it and report it to us. From June to September 2020, we removed over 9.7 million pieces of terrorist content on Facebook, 99% of which we detected proactively.”</p>



<p>While undoubtedly effective, aggressive AI-based content removal isn’t perfect. Journalists across the Middle East and North Africa regularly have their Facebook and Twitter accounts <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-doesn-t-care-activists-say-accounts-removed-despite-zuckerberg-n1231110">suspended</a> after posting material related to conflicts or human rights abuses. Charities working with Syrian refugees have for years complained about <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/paypal-venmo-iran-syria-sanctions-crime-detection-system.html">PayPal’s keyword filters</a> blocking donations. And as social media companies get faster at taking down content, often without anyone having seen it, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/10/video-unavailable/social-media-platforms-remove-evidence-war-crimes">human rights groups</a> and activists worry that they may be erasing vital evidence of war crimes that could be of use in future trials.</p>



<p>AI has other weaknesses too. Accounts that are more subtle about illegal affiliations may go unnoticed, allowing disguised ISIS content to slip through. Of the more than 40 apparently al-Hol-linked Facebook accounts found by <em>Rest of World</em> in October, only around half had been removed by December. Additionally, account administrators often maintain a network of duplicate or backup accounts, so that if one is blocked or removed, others are ready to take its place.</p>

<p><strong>In contrast to</strong> Facebook, Telegram has relatively few safeguards against terrorist content. Launched in 2013 by Russians Nikolai and Pavel Durov, the Dubai-based company is <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/silk-road-is-dead-long-live-silk-road/">known for prioritizing privacy and free speech over nearly all other concerns.</a> This stance has made it popular among people living in authoritarian regimes, and it has also made it the app of choice for violent extremists. The company has conducted coordinated sweeps to remove ISIS content, but channels openly devoted to ISIS news and propaganda still regularly appear — including ones that raise money for escape attempts from al-Hol. (Telegram did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>



<p>While many jurisdictions hold the person who posts illegal content — rather than the platform itself — accountable, that may be changing in the U.K. and the E.U., where new draft legislation being considered would place responsibility on platforms to police themselves.</p>



<p>Vera Mironova, a visiting fellow at Harvard University who has extensively monitored online terrorist fundraising campaigns, notes that posts follow the mores of their host platform. “So secretive campaigns would not be posted on Facebook, or if they were, they would sound more humanitarian and not use words like ‘ISIS.’ But the ones on Telegram go full hurrah,” she explained. This same dynamic plays out on a country-by-country level, Mironova added, and is especially apparent on payment platforms. “Some countries — let’s say Russia or parts of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Microsoft has joined forces with Europe’s publishers to deepen the troubles of Google and Facebook, launching a project to develop an Australian-style arbitration system for the EU that would force Big Tech to pay for news.</p>
<p>The move by the Seattle-based company is one of its most brazen yet to align with the press industry, exploit the difficulties of its Silicon Valley rivals and promote its own search engine Bing as a copyright-friendly alternative for news. </p>
<p>The project announced on Monday will involve Microsoft working with Europe’s four leading lobby groups for news publishers to develop a legal solution to “mandate payments” for the use of content by “gatekeepers that have dominant market power”. </p>
<p>The informal coalition, which will propose that the plan is added to upcoming EU legislation on Big Tech, includes the European Publishers Council, News Media Europe, and the associations for European magazine and newspaper publishers, which together represent thousands of news outlets.</p>
<p>Microsoft and the publishers said on Monday that they will support a form of arbitration, and will look closely at the model developed in Australia, which has prompted Google to strike a flurry of licensing deals and Facebook to stop sharing Australian news on its service.</p>
<p>Christian Van Thillo, a Belgian media executive who is chair of the European Publishers Council, welcomed “Microsoft’s recognition” of the value “our content brings to the core business of search engines and social networks”.</p>
<p>“It is crucial that our regulators recognise this key point, and don’t get misled into thinking that side deals on the basis of a standalone product are the same thing,” he said, adding: “All publishers should get an agreement — no one should be left out.”</p>
<p>Microsoft has offered vocal public support for the Australian reforms and has urged other governments to follow suit, much to the chagrin of its rivals. </p>
<p>Unveiling the project with European publishers, Casper Klynge, a vice-president of Microsoft, said access to quality news was “critical to the success of our democracies”. </p>
<p>The Australian system has caught the eye of regulators around the world, who are also looking for ways to empower publishers in licensing negotiations with Google and Facebook. </p>
<p>Canada is preparing Australia-style laws, and the EU and UK are looking at importing elements of the system into upcoming laws. It remains unclear whether the calculations of lawmakers have been changed by Facebook’s decision to boycott news in Australia.</p>
<p>EU governments are in the process of implementing a recent overhaul of copyright law, which strengthened the claim of publishers to seek compensation for the use of news snippets by Google. </p>
<p>But industry executives and some MEPs are concerned that the provisions, which do not include any arbitration system to resolve disputes, are too easy for Big Tech groups to sidestep. Google recently reached a licensing deal with French publishers, but paid much smaller sums than the settlements agreed with Australian publishers.</p>
<p>Fernando de Yarza, president of News Media Europe, said: “The experiences in France and Australia have shown us that there’s a real need for a binding instrument.”</p>
<p>The Financial Times has reached commercial agreements for news with both Google and Facebook. The FT is not a member of any of the associations involved in the Microsoft initiative.</p>
<p>Google and Facebook both strongly criticise the Australian reforms as unworkable and unfair. Neither company had commented on Microsoft’s initiative in Europe by the time of publication. </p>

      <p>Dashboards have long been the much maligned visualization vehicle of choice for decision-making in commercial and governmental situations.  While the visualization research community has concentrated much of its effort on visual analytics, the commercial success and widespread use of dashboards begs more attention.  Critically, dashboards are becoming many peoples’ direct connection to “big data” sources, enabling data democratization and wider access to data.</p>

<p>In this paper, we explore the genre of dashboards through a two-prong approach.  We survey the existing literature in business, marketing, and related fields to capture the relevant factors to consider when designing appropriate dashboards and their tools for consumption by different parties, all of which have differing levels of visualization literacy, data literacy, and decision agency.  We also collect examples of dashboard designs based on the dimensions derived from our literature search, and identify different clusters of dashboard designs with similar analysis goals, audiences, and decision support.</p>

<p>We call ourselves the “dashboard conspiracy:” a truly diverse collection of authors across Tableau Research, Microsoft Research, and Simon Fraiser University.</p>

<p><em>This work was presented at <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome">IEEE VIS 2018</a> in Berlin, Germany.</em></p>

February 22, 2021 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/state-of-graphql-2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/state-of-graphql-2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The State of JavaScript is an annual survey that collects data from JS professionals from across the globe. This year’s edition questioned  23,765 developers in 137 countries about development areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-end frameworks,</li>
<li>Back-end framework</li>
<li>JavaScript flavors,</li>
<li>Testing libraries,</li>
<li>Build tools,</li>
<li><em>Data layer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at GraphQL data concluded in the Data layer part of the survey.</p>
<h2>Data layer report</h2>
<p>The data layer part covers technologies used to transmit and manage data. The users were asked about their awareness, interest, usage experience, and satisfaction with various data layer libraries (including GraphQ) and here are the results.</p>
<h4>The awareness and interest</h4>
<p>Since becoming publicly available in 2015 GraphQL has received a lot of coverage on the Internet, both positive and negative. The awareness of GraphQL is constantly growing (from 97% to 98% comparing to the previous year) while the interest graph shows a little decline (from 90% to 87%), which seems to be pretty natural for maturing technology.</p>
<h4>The usage of GraphQL</h4>
<p>The growth of GraphQL usage among survey responders was the biggest between 2018 and 2019 and it amounted to 40% (from 22%) so it’s unrealistic to expect the same pace of growth. <strong>In 2020 the usage of GraphQL has gained 6%</strong> which seems to be a fine result, especially when thinking about GraphQL as a somehow mature technology.</p>

    </span></p>
<h4>The satisfaction of GraphQL</h4>
<p>The satisfaction of GraphQL remains and nearly the same level.
The advantages and flaws of GraphQL are factually described in various articles, blog posts and talks so users deciding to give GraphQL know what they are signing for. GraphQL has a great community standing behind it, working hard every day to provide solutions, tools and different ways to overcome all its shortcomings. </p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h4>The GraphQL Experience</h4>
<p>The general experience observed in past years shows a positive tone. The number of people that never heard, are not interested or wound not use GraphQL has decreased significantly and the latest results show that 88.1% of respondents are either interested in GraphQL or declares that they have already worked with and would do it again.</p>

<h2>The summary</h2>
<p>The data layer space is still in constant movement which makes selecting the right technology for your needs a bit tricky. The survey administrators decided to prepare a data graph that could possibly really help you decide if the technology you are looking into is going in the right direction and ease the process of the decision if you should start seriously thinking about adopting it.</p>

<p>Each of the lines represents different technology and is filled by the data from 2016 to 2020. The higher position on the Y-axis means that the technology has been used by more people, and a point further to the right on the X-axis means more users have used it and would use it again or are interested in learning more about it.</p>
<p>Over a couple of last years, GraphQL has ranked up from technology worth keeping an eye on (with low usage, but high satisfaction) to a date later characterizing in high usage and satisfaction which makes it a safe technology to adopt. The general conclusion is that GraphQL and all the technologies, libraries, tools its fuelling are here to stay. </p>

<p><em>Summary: JWCC is a minimal extension to the widely used JSON file format with
(1) optional commas after the final element of arrays and objects and (2) C/C++
style comments. These two features make it more suitable for human-editable
configuration files, without adding so many features that it’s incompatible
with numerous other (deliberate and accidental) existing JSON extensions.</em></p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>The Peter Principle is the half-joking, half-serious observation that people
get promoted to their level of incompetence, because being competent at level
<code>N</code> leads to being promoted to level <code>N+1</code>.</p>

<p>My colleague Simon Morris made a similar observation about software complexity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Software has a Peter Principle. If a piece of code is comprehensible, someone
will extend it, so they can apply it to their own problem. If it’s
incomprehensible, they’ll write their own code instead. Code tends to be
extended to its level of incomprehensibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-many-json-extensions">The Many JSON Extensions</h3>

<p>There’s a similar story with file formats. If they’re comprehensible, they’ll
get extended. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is this article’s example. The
<a href="https://json.org/">original specification</a> fits on a single page, either as
text or diagrams. The file format is simple and ubiquitous. Therefore, there
are many extensions - supersets of JSON. Here’s just a few (including two
slightly different extensions both called “JSONC”):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://json5.org/">JSON5</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://komkom.github.io/">JSONC</a> #1</li>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments">JSONC</a> #2</li>
  <li><a href="https://hjson.github.io/">HJSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Suprisingly, <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> is also a superset of JSON. Not just
conceptually, but also in the sense that valid JSON files are also valid YAML
files (although there’s some divergence about whether duplicate keys are
legitimate). As a bonus, if you use YAML, then to paraphrase <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">Jamie
Zawinski</a>: now you have <a href="https://noyaml.com/">NO
problems</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wandering-off-the-specification">Wandering Off the Specification</h3>

<p>There are also informal supersets-of-JSON in widespread use, sometimes more by
accident than by design. The Chromium web browser’s <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:base/json/json_reader.h;l=27;drc=d0919138b7951c1a154cf802a68aad7904b6f4c9">JSON parser goes
off-spec</a>
in a number of ways. The timeline could have been:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some developer long ago (perhaps in a yak-shaving hurry) wrote or
copy/pasted some parsing code that was accidentally too lenient, allowing a
superset-of-JSON. Perhaps they re-used existing code that handled C-style
string escapes, like the <code>"\n"</code> in <code>"line\nbreak"</code>, without realizing that
it also unescaped <code>"\v"</code>, valid in a C string but not a JSON string.</li>
  <li>People use the software. They write first-party and third-party JSON for it.
Some of it is actually malformed (e.g. they have <code>"\v"</code> inside strings) but
tests (manual and automatic) usually check that new features work, not that
all the slightly-incorrect things are rejected. Nobody notices at the time.</li>
  <li>Years pass. <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a> slowly kicks in. We
can no longer tighten this custom JSON parser implementation to follow the
spec more strictly because too many things (in unknown places) will break.</li>
</ol>

<p>This also affects our ability to replace one JSON library with another. For
example, we might want to switch from a C++-based JSON parser to a Rust-based
one, because of its security benefits. If the upstream Rust library chooses to
follow the spec diligently (which is a perfectly reasonable position) then it
would ‘break’ our apps that have inadvertently relied on the previous
looser-than-the-spec implementation.</p>

<p>We could carry local patches, but that isn’t free. Upstream fuzz-testing
infrastructure only exercises the unmodified library, not our patched flavor.
Future upstream changes may also invalidate the downstream patch, possibly in
subtle ways. An upstream “this new unsafe block is OK because it’s a private
implementation detail and nothing in this crate does X” comment might not be
aware that our out-of-tree patch does X to its internals.</p>

<h3 id="quirks">Quirks</h3>

<p>The Wuffs library approach is to expose
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/doc/note/quirks.md">quirks</a>: runtime
configuration options to go off-spec in various ways so that Wuffs’
implementation can be a drop-in replacement for other implementations, without
the need for downstream patches.</p>

<p>Wuffs has <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/std/json/decode_quirks.wuffs">20 JSON
quirks</a>
so far. As always, there are trade-offs. They’re not free (in terms of
maintenance cost) and have super-linear complexity: that file’s comments also
has 12 call-outs to the subtleties of combining two particular quirks.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the emergent complexity when combining two simple-sounding
JSON extensions. The first one adds C++-style <code>/* slash-star block comments */</code>
and <code>// double-slash line comments</code>. The second one packs multiple top-level
values in a single stream, separated by line breaks.</p>

<p>That second extension - by itself and when holding minified, whitespace-free
‘vanilla’ (non-extended) JSON - plays well with Unix’s traditional
line-oriented tools. It is sometimes known as Line-Delimited JSON
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON">LDJSON</a>),
Newline-Delimited JSON (<a href="http://ndjson.org/">NDJSON</a>) and JSON Lines
(<a href="http://jsonlines.org/">JSONL</a>). But “one value per line” tools’ assumptions
can break if slash-star comments can also contain blank lines.</p>

<p>Here’s another question (let’s call it the ‘end of comment’ question). Is the
<code>'\n'</code> at the end of of a <code>// double-slash line comment</code> actually part of the
comment? At first, this sounds merely philosophical. Comments are ignored and,
in ‘vanilla’ JSON, all whitespace is ignored, so why the distinction?</p>

<p>The ‘right’ answer to that ‘end of comment’ question isn’t obvious, but it can
affect whether a line comment at the end of a multi-value stream should end in
1 or 2 <code>'\n'</code> bytes. Ideally the answer should be self-consistent with whether
a line comment at the end of file must end with the <code>'\n'</code> or whether the
implicit EOF (end-of-file) alone suffices. See also the <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">“Parsing JSON is a
Minefield”</a> and <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/12/28/">“Unintuitive JSON
Parsing”</a> articles for how subtle a
‘simple’ format like JSON can be.</p>

<p>Wuffs makes one particular choice for that ‘end of comment’ question. Its
particular choice probably isn’t that important, more that it made a concious
and documented choice.</p>

<h3 id="clarity-not-terseness">Clarity, not Terseness</h3>

<p>Some general advice, when designing a new file format or extending an existing
one, is keep some room for future extensions. For example, allowing unquoted
strings (writing <code>foo</code> instead of <code>"foo"</code>), is certainly convenient, but
re-defining <code>undefined</code> or <code>datetime</code> without quotes, from invalid JSON syntax
to valid some-extension-of-JSON strings, rules out a future extension adding
new ‘keywords’.</p>

<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a> is binary at the wire format level (unlike textual
JSON) but naturally extends JSON at the object model level. It also has an
<code>undefined</code> concept separate from <code>null</code>, and <code>undefined</code> can be a map key. We
couldn’t do the ‘obvious’ CBOR-to-some-extended-JSON conversion if <code>undefined</code>,
without quotes, was already repurposed to mean a string.</p>

<p>I find it suprising that, <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#unquoted-strings">in
HOCON</a>,
“<code>truefoo</code> parses as the boolean token <code>true</code> followed by the unquoted string
<code>foo</code>. However, <code>footrue</code> parses as the unquoted string <code>footrue</code>”.</p>

<p>It can also be helpful for a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=return.flase+extension%3Apy">typo like
<code>flase</code></a> to be picked
up early as a syntax error (without needing schemas or type checking) instead
of silently accepted (as a string, not a bool). This can otherwise be
especially dangerous if further processed in a weakly-typed programming
language where any non-empty string is ‘truthy’.</p>

<p><code>[a b c]</code> is invalid ‘vanilla’ JSON syntax, but in the various extended-JSON
variants, is it a list with three 1-byte strings or one 5-byte string? Or is it
one 3-byte string because three 1-byte strings are implicitly
whitespace-delimited and also then implicitly concatenated? Any particular
answer can be consistent in its own world, but different JSON extensions make
different choices. This can be confusing when software grows large enough (or
gains enough transitive dependencies) to have to speak multiple JSON
extensions.</p>

<p>These days, when I’m programming in C/C++ or Go, I often add unnecessary
parentheses in expressions like <code>(a * b) + c</code>. Even though they’re redundant
because of well-defined operator precedence rules, different programming
languages have different precedence rules and getting the precedence wrong can
lead to <a href="https://github.com/jbangert/nail/issues/7">hard-to-spot bugs</a>. The
Wuffs language actually <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/doc/wuffs-the-language.md#operators">rejects a bare <code>a * b +
c</code></a>
and you have to parenthesize the multiplication or the addition.</p>

<p>Similarly, for JSON-like documents, I prefer the clarity of either <code>["a", "b",
"c"]</code> or <code>["a b c"]</code>, even if it means a little extra typing. Reading is more
important than writing for code and configuration, especially when multiple
people or long periods of time are involved.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-jwcc">Introducing JWCC</h2>

<p>Having said all of that, here is yet another superset-of-JSON, called JWCC
(JSON With Commas and Comments). It is a minimal extension. As its name
suggests, there are only two new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Commas” lets you optionally have a comma after the final element of an array
or an object: <code>[1,2,3,]</code>. When you format one element per line, it’s easier
to insert and remove elements (and eyeball the diffs) when you don’t have to
fiddle with any commas (or lack of commas) on adjacent but otherwise
unrelated lines.</li>
  <li>“Comments” lets you have C++-style <code>/* slash-star block comments */</code> and <code>//
double-slash line comments</code>, anywhere where ‘vanilla’ JSON allows whitespace.
Line comments must end with a <code>'\n'</code> byte, even at the end of the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, while every JSON file is valid JWCC, this is a new file format. It
just happens to be very familiar if you (or your software) already speak JSON.
Yes, Doug Crockford <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105080225if_/https://plus.google.com/+DouglasCrockfordEsq/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr">deliberately removed comments from
JSON</a>
but people keep putting them back in. If we’re going to have comment-enriched
JSON (e.g. for human-editable configuration files), we might as well have a
standard one. Cue <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD #927 “Standards”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cc-implementation">C/C++ Implementation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs">Wuffs</a>’ JSON library (availble as a C or C++
API) can decode either ‘vanilla’ JSON or JWCC, using its quirks mechanism.
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/tree/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/example/jsonptr"><code>jsonptr</code></a>
is a command line tool (a JSON formatter) that uses this library. By default,
it speaks spec-compliant ‘vanilla’ JSON:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo '[1,2,/*hello*/3,]' | jsonptr
[
    1,
    2
json: bad input
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has a JWCC mode:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo '[1,2,/*hello*/3,]' | jsonptr -jwcc
[
    1,
    2,
    /*hello*/
    3,
]
</code></pre></div></div>

    <article itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        <section>
            <p>For the past year, I've been increasingly focusing on what I have come to call "sociotechnical security" - whereas "technical security" seeks to identify and remove unintended flaws in the architecture of platforms, "sociotechnical security" is all about identifying and removing the incentives for how worst-faith users may abuse the explicit intent of platform affordances. Making this "sociotechnical" distinction brings into the frame a lot of issues not typically considered to be security issues, but are proving to become existential threats to a bunch of different businesses. Social platforms have misinformation problems due (in part) to fake accounts spreading it, online marketplaces face algorithmic manipulation challenges from sellers jockeying for position, and platforms with weak security around analytics face all sorts of ad and impression count fraud.</p>

<p>Today I want to share an exploit that I spent the last week investigating, and am calling "SubstackDB," after Substack, where I first identified the problem. Specifically, platforms tend to prefer low-friction interfaces, and tend to afford users increasing flexibility in affordances provided. Substack's WYSIWYG editor for drafting posts is overly optimistic in assuming good faith in user behavior, and is exposed to a huge flaw - because there is no validation for the input of files uploaded into the editor, and because their upload functionality has no verification scheme beyond requiring an active user session, their file server can be hijacked for any arbitrary use case. Far from being the only company facing this issue, Discord also suffers from a nearly identical problem. As a proof of concept, I used the unpublished APIs for both Substack and Discord's file uploading capabilities to store copies of GPT2 on their servers, and I provide the necessary scripts for loading and verifying the execution of those models. Additionally, I am providing a ruby implementation of <code>SubstackDB</code> which, given a valid username and password allows a user to upload and download any file of any size.</p>

<h2 id="substackvulnerability">Substack Vulnerability</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VQhkAow.png" alt="Substack Editor"></p>

<p>This is a picture of Substack's WYSIWYG post editor with an example image uploaded. Here's a look at the <code>cURL</code> request that uploaded the image, and the response back from the server:</p>



<p>And the response:  </p>



<p>It turns out that this "bucketeer" name refers to a Heroku file server plugin, which presumably also indicates that Substack is at least partially hosted there. Regardless, through trial and error, I determined that only a very small portion of the above <code>cURL</code> is required to send a file:</p>

<p>Here, the <code>[BASE 64 BYTES]</code> refers to literally any content that is Base64 encoded. In our case it is an image, but it turns out that any data encoded in Base64 will be treated as valid input. Through more trial and error, I determined that while there seems to be no upper limit to the size of an uploaded file, though it is in practice limited by timeout errors that ultimately invalidate the request. Further, this "image" upload functionality actually returns the original file byte-for-byte, so no compression occurs between upload and receiving the final URL - because of this, we can store any other data relatively easily and just declare the "type" of the content to be one of the valid types required by the upload endpoint.</p>

<p>To prove that any arbitrary content could be uploaded, I downloaded a copy of the GPT2 "medium" model via <code>aitextgen</code>, split the <code>.bin</code> file containing the model into several hundred smaller files of equal size, and then uploaded those to Substack's endpoint. Finally, I wrote a script that reconstructs the model using a final "manifest" JSON file stored on Substack as well:</p>

<p>Discord's vulnerability seems a bit more intentional as a feature than as a bug per se, but is still ripe for abuse. Using a throwaway account and throwaway server, I was granted a set of credentials - using those credentials, I was able to slightly alter the script I used to upload GPT2.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rdwMF5D.png" alt="Uploaded 6mb slices of GPT2"></p>

<p>Discord appears to treat non-image uploads as more of a first-order object in their system - clearly, there is some form of intent to allow users to upload files of some nature. What is likely outside the intent, however, is automating this affordance to send gigabytes of content through their platform in a relatively short time frame. Ultimately, I was able to generate a nearly identical script as was deployed in the Substack case.</p>



<h2 id="substackdbscript">SubstackDB Script</h2>

<p>Finally, to prove out the concept of truly using this type of vulnerability as an arbitrary file server, I wrote a generalized <code>SubstackDB</code> class which, in this version of the script, takes as input the username, password, and filepath, and returns a print-out of whether or not the contents of that filepath, once read, uploaded, and downloaded, is identical to the original source file. In practice, one could use this script to be a literal drop-in replacement for many classic file store APIs. </p>



<h2 id="endnote">Endnote</h2>

<p>This is just two examples of a general problem with upload validation. Of note, I also explored exploits like this on Meetup, Indiegogo, Gumroad, and a few others, and while it was still likely <em>technically</em> possible to pull off a similar stunt, it was in no way worth the investment in time that it would take to fully reverse engineer their implementations - generally, the issue was that one-time-use tokens were being employed to validate uploads on a per-upload basis, which proved to be too much of a pain to solve. The point, however, is that this is a demonstration of a systemic issue - by assuming best-faith use, platforms allow worst-faith users the unintended "sociotechnical" affordance of a free fileserver at the cost of the platform. </p>

    <p>I made a control board for the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboard that converts it to wired USB, and now my favorite keyboard is even better.</p>

</figure>

<p>The QMK config is available at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware">@chadaustin/qmk_firmware</a> (<a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/sculpt">keyboards/handwired/sculpt/</a>), and the PCB design files at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb">@chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb</a>.</p>

<p>I’m planning on making at least one more, so if you’d like one, maybe I can help.</p>

<p>It’s a huge improvement. Latency is reduced by about 13 milliseconds, and with full control over the microcontroller’s firmware, you can customize keymaps and layers, and actually use the keyboard’s built-in LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Feel free to stop reading here — I am going to tell the sequence of events that led to this project. Besides some exposure to basic voltage and resistance circuits in college, I have very little electronics background. But, in a short time, I went from only barely knowing what a capacitor was to having a working PCB manufactured and assembled, and maybe this will inspire someone else to give it a try.</p>

<p>Since developing RSI in college, I’ve exclusively used Microsoft’s ergonomic keyboards. And when I first tried the Sculpt, I instantly knew it was the best yet. The soft actuation, short key travel, and rigid frame are perfect for my hands. And because the number pad is a separate device, the distance to my mouse is shortened.</p>

<p>My brother went out and bought one too. Not much later, he gave it to me, saying the latency was inconsistent and high, and it was unacceptable for gaming. I thought he was being uniquely sensitive, since I had no problem in either Linux, Windows 7, or macOS. But then I updated to Windows 10 and saw exactly what he meant.</p>

<p>It was like the keyboard would go to sleep if a key wasn’t pressed for a few seconds, and the first keypress after a wake would be delayed or, worse, dropped.</p>

<p>And heaven forbid I use my USB 3 hub, whose EMI would disrupt the 2.4 GHz signal, and <em>every other</em> keypress would be unreliable. I’d gone as far as mounting the wireless transceiver directly under my keyboard, on the underside of my desk, and keys were still dropped.</p>

<p>So, best keyboard ever. But wireless sucks. (But mostly in Windows 10? No idea about that.)</p>

<h2 id="over-the-hump">Over the Hump</h2>

<p>What started this whole thing is that the <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/eden/#edenfs">EdenFS</a> team was a bunch of keyboard enthusiasts. During the pandemic, as we’re all at home burning out and missing each other, we were trying to think of some virtual team offsites. Wez offered to walk everyone through building a <a href="https://www.1upkeyboards.com/instructions-downloads/sweet-16-instructions/">Sweet 16 Macro Pad</a>.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg" alt="Assembled Sweet 16 underside"></a>
<figcaption>Assembled Sweet 16 underside. This is take two, after resoldering and cleaning the whole thing. Take one was a bit of a mess.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, okay, a keyboard is a matrix, with some diodes used to disambiguate the signalling, and a microcontroller that rapidly polls the matrix and reports events over USB…</p>

<p>So maybe I could fix the Sculpt! I bought a transceiver-less Sculpt off eBay for cheap and <a href="http://emmanuelcontreras.com/how-to/how-to-disassemble-microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-and-make-it-wired/">popped it open (thanks Emmanuel Contreras!)</a>, thinking maybe its controller could be flashed with new firmware that speaks USB. The Sculpt uses a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF24LE1_PS_v1.6.pdf">Nordic Semiconductor nRF24LE1</a>, but I was nowhere near capable of making use of that information at the time, though it did point me to Samy Kamkar’s horrifying guide on <a href="https://samy.pl/keysweeper/">surreptitiously sniffing keystrokes from nearby (older) Microsoft wireless keyboards</a>.</p>

<p>I almost gave up here, but Per Vognsen <a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1322422385174220800">suggested I scan the matrix myself</a> and it turns out Michael Fincham had already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhkgnp/modification_photos_qmk_wired_microsoft_sculpt/">mapped out the matrix and soldered a Teensy 2.0++ board onto the Sculpt’s test pads</a>, showing this was doable!</p>

<p>So I ordered my own microcontroller to try the same thing.</p>

<p>First, I bought an Arduino Pro Micro, like the Sweet 16 uses. Oh hey, 18 GPIO pins isn’t enough to drive the Sculpt’s 26-pin matrix. I looked at using an I2C GPIO expander, but it felt like taking on too much.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Arduino Pro Micro. Wait, you need pins to scan a matrix?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>More pins? QMK’s Proton C has more pins! So I carefully soldered onto the test pads as Michael had shown was possible… and it worked!</p>

<figcaption>All test pads connected to Proton C. It works!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Getting those wires to stick to the pads without shorting was tricky. (I hadn’t yet discovered how magical flux is.)</p>

<p>The keyboard worked, but I couldn’t fit the board, its wires, and the new microcontroller into the case, and I wasn’t <em>really</em> happy leaving it in this state, even if I could pack it in somehow.</p>

<p>I thought, all I <em>really</em> need is the ribbon cable connector, so I ordered a 30 pin, 1.0 mm pitch ribbon breakout and the pricier (but tons of pins!) <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy 2.0++</a>. Looking back, it’s cute that I was trying to save $10 on the microcontroller… You just have to get used to spending money on whatever saves you time.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/breakout-and-teensy.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/breakout-and-teensy.jpeg" alt="Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++"></a>
<figcaption>Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, it was almost as annoying to solder, and still didn’t fit. So much for saving money on microcontrollers.</p>

<p>I thought about giving up. Is it really that bad that my keys don’t always register in games? Can I just tolerate some flakiness and latency?</p>

<p>But Jon Watte offered to spend an entire day showing me how to use KiCad, design circuits, layout PCBs, select components on Digi-Key, scan datasheets for the important information, and how to work with a PCB manufacturing house. Of course you never turn down opportunities like that.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---schematic">Designing the Final Board - Schematic</h2>

<p>Assuming, like me, you’ve never done this, I’ll summarize the steps.</p>

<p>First you sketch out the circuit schematic.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png" alt="Schematic"></a>
<figcaption>Schematic in KiCad. Most of this was informed by the datasheet and Atmel's design guides.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jon showed me several tricks in KiCad, like global labels, and starting with some standard resistor and capacitor values, but it’s very important that you go through the datasheets, because details can matter a ton.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted the main processor to be the AT90USB1286 controller, and fortunately KiCad already had a symbol for it. Atmel has a comprehensive and accessible data sheet, which showed me I needed some 22 Ω resistors on the USB data lines, which of the ISP programmer lines needed resistors (and appropriate values), and that I needed to either pull HWB low, or provide a physical switch that pulls it low, in order to allow rebooting the device into USB firmware update mode.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of things that are implicitly known to electrical engineers but that were new to me. You want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ground plane under the data lines and most of the microcontroller if possible.</li>
  <li>an electrolytic or tantalum bypass capacitor on the main 5V power from USB.</li>
  <li>ceramic filter capacitors on each power pin.</li>
  <li>appropriate values for the resonance capacitors on your crystal.</li>
  <li>electrostatic discharge protection! Turns out transients are common and it’s easy to fry a chip just by plugging it in.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then when you get into concerns like EMI and high-frequency signal integrity, the rabbit hole goes deep.</p>

<p>I kept having to tell myself “it’s just a keyboard”, but it also helped that there are a great number of high-quality resources on these topics just a click away. I spent lots of time on <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/">EEVBlog</a>.</p>

<p>Before finishing the circuit design, Jon had me do a couple smart things. In case the factory-supplied USB bootloader didn’t work out, he suggested I add the footprint (but not a connector!) for an ISP programmer and a debug LED to prove code would work at all.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---physical-layout">Designing the Final Board - Physical Layout</h2>

<p>After arranging the schematic and ensuring it passed the electrical rules check, it was time to pick specific components. That is, the reference to a 220 Ω resistor is replaced with the Panasonic ERJ-3EKF2200V, 0603 surface mount.</p>

<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind. For common components, like resistors and ceramic capacitors, there is a huge amount of choice. For example, I see over 1400 surface-mount 220 Ω resistors on digikey. I tried to just stick with one high-quality brand like Panasonic or Samsung for all of that stuff.</p>

<p>The important thing is the physical form factor, which determines the footprint on the board. Once you pick a part, it has a size, and you need to tell KiCad which physical footprint should be assigned to that component. I used 0603 resistors, so I assigned each resistor in the schematic the “Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric” footprint.</p>

<p>Same for everything else. Jon showed me how to draw my own footprints, but to avoid complexity, I was able to find appropriate footprints in KiCad’s standard libraries for every component I needed.</p>

<p>When you import the schematic into Pcbnew, it’s time to figure out where things go. Where are the edges of the board? Make careful measurements here. Where do the mounting holes go? Where do you want 
the microcontroller? Where do you want the USB port?</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/dimensions.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/dimensions.jpeg" alt="Measuring dimensions and mounting holes"></a>
<figcaption>Measuring dimensions and mounting holes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also, you have to pick through-hole sizes and trace widths. Jon had me use .250 mm for the narrow traces and .500 mm for the wider ones, presumably from experience. I used the narrow traces for signalling and wide traces for power, though I’ve since heard it’s a good idea to use narrow traces between filter capacitors and VBUS.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/pcb-layout.svg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/pcb-layout.svg" alt="Schematic"></a>
<figcaption>PCB layout in KiCad</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course, there’s some iteration between the schematic and the PCB. After physically placing the ribbon cable connector and MCU, the traces all crossed over each other, so I had to reassign all the pins so it made sense physically.</p>

<p>There are also physical constraints about how USB data lines are run, and how the electrostatic protection chip wants to be placed for the most protection.</p>

<p>So, as simple as this board is, I spent a fair amount of time getting all of that right.</p>

<p>I found myself getting lost in the abstractness of holes and traces and footprints, so it was helpful to ground myself by occasionally loading the PCB in KiCad’s 3D viewer.</p>

		<p>Back when I was starting to code several years ago. I picked up The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond and I was blown away at the idea of free software. Just in case you are not familiar, free software as in freedom and not free beer. Free software back then was this super radical and idealistic concept where as you make a software product commercial or not, but when you distribute it you include the source code of it. The person who got your product would eventually continue to develop it and it will evolve and continually improve as it gets to many users. You then will be looking at their version of your product and will see how it has grown further. Think of it has a community garden where everyone grows their vegetable and anyone would then take pointers on some of your crops and grow their improved version. Eventually you’ll see where you are doing it wrong by looking at how they tend their garden. This is not necessarily free food for everyone – although it’s common. It’s freedom to copy and use my garden setup so we have bigger crops next harvest time.</p>
<p>This what happened to Linux, nodejs, Ruby etc.. I’ve believed in it much so I joined sourceforge joined a team, also started a project myself even. I followed this radical concept through the years and publish my projects openly on github. It was fun and there is some sort of social acceptance when people see your ugly looking code yet they accept it and submit their own ugly looking code as well.</p>
<p>Facebook, Apple, Google these companies are worth trillions of dollars and they all at one point when they are still small companies depended on open source. Their founders built an MVP and took money from VCs and then had to responsibly return their money 10x. They eventually all cashed out and now driving luxury sports cars. Meanwhile present day Linux desktop is still dead. Open source maintainers abandoning projects due to lack of time and interest. They say why not just use GPL but if you license your code using GPL you will not have users. Developers can’t even share the name of the software they are putting your code into because of these NDA they signed. Sometimes it’s just a simple request like attribution and compliance is still uncommon.</p>
<p>Life as a open source maintainer is sometimes a <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/02/19/i-will-slaughter-you/">life threatening endeavor</a></p>
<p>Society, Conglomerates, and Capitalism killed free software and nobody cared. It’s all about 10x ROI and taking advantage of some poor idiot programmer clueless in business.</p>

February 22, 2021 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A long time ago, I gave a talk in front of a full audience talking about BigchainDB, a company I worked for to create a (scalable) decentralized database. As we just had released our browser-compatible JavaScript driver, enthusiastically, I told the audience: "... and so by using our driver from within the browser, your app won't need a backend anymore"!</p>
<p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, and started drinking Ethereum's web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly became something extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browser extension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, it still is extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browser today, you can visit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziest things with your digital money. An excellent recent example of this are DeFi (short for "Decentralized Finance") websites. They allow a user to engage in trading cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer to peer lending. With the click of a button and no mandatory signups, you're able to pool thousands of dollars. That is super cool and confirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p>
<p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never was such a thing in the first place. All I know is that someone named a library "web3.js". Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereum nodes when working in a browser environment (JavaScript).</p>
<p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g., pool ether in a smart contract, most calculations are supported by the web3.js library that periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimately web3.js allows the user to send the transaction to the node to transfer the user's money.</p>
<p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on the user's browser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the same key on different websites.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that's web3. It's supposed to be a play on words regarding "web 2.0". Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gave us modern single-page applications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3? An advancement towards what exactly? Money websites?</p>
<p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specific memories, specifically, let's say you could do <code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And then someone asked you how you'd envision a blockchain-based and smart-contract-enabled web3; you'd likely describe an ecosystem vastly different to what it is today. You'd think about peer-2-peer networks, light clients, and renewed web standards. That's precisely not web3.</p>
<p>In today's experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websites that crash or stop working when you've neglected to install Metamask (or other key-management plugins). Opening a web3 website's network console, you'll see that it's making an excessive amount of RPC request to an Ethereum full node. Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popular cloud provider hosting Ethereum full nodes. That's kinda stupid.</p>
<p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specific contract calls, what's even more stupid, is that all your money may be at the risk of continually getting stolen with the accidential click of a button. Either by someone hacking the website's server. Or by the website provider becoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because a website pretends to do X when it does Y (stealing all your money).</p>
<p>But instead of continuing to rant, I'd now like to now point out what I think should change about web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinking about a standardizable web API. We must stop training our users to install shitty browser plugins!</li>
<li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and become independent from third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li>
<li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) by dramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damn it!)!</li>
<li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain's fundamental properties. Most data is immutable so let's start caching things.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention on bumping the web's version number. Maybe we should reconsider writing more backends. We should promote more work on permissionless networks like Open Gas Station Network that allow developers to upgrade a user's experience. And, we should start thinking of a machine network of blockchains more often. In many ways, web3 was just a cool demo. But let's come up with something better. Just imagine what happens once there's a deeper integration of money into computer systems!</p>

			<p>The year is 1911. The setting, the Swedish university of Uppsala’s <em>aula magna, </em>bursting with listeners. The occasion is the installation of the Swedish philosopher Axel Hägerström as chair professor of practical philosophy.</p>
<p>As part of the ceremony Hägerström was to hold a public lecture. Not long into the address, Hägerström’s explosive philosophy managed to spark a riot in the lecture-hall: vegetables were hurled, doors slammed. At the end of the lecture, the archbishop of the Swedish Lutheran church, the Reverend Nathan Söderblom, stood up and asked how anyone who harbored such views could ever behave decently towards his wife and kids.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is an accurate portrayal of the event, this is the form the story was handed down to me by one of my professors at Uppsala University, a proud inheritor of the tradition of Hägerström. The anecdote was delivered with an air of disbelief over the naiveté of the archbishop’s question. How could anyone believe that such abstract and abstruse doctrines on the semantics of ethical sentences could have any concrete repercussions on practical issues like how one treats one’s family?</p>
<p>More than a century after Hägerström’s lecture, Sweden’s response in the global COVID-19 pandemic has cast long shadows, drawing attention from all over the globe. Unlike the vast majority of other countries, Sweden has taken scant measures to hinder the spread of the virus. No lockdown. No closure of schools or public means of transport. No obligatory face masks. The infection was left to spread as quickly and widely as possible, in an attempt to achieve “herd immunity” among the population. As a result of this, Sweden is among the countries with the highest death toll per capita, more than twenty times as much as other comparable Nordic countries, all of which have taken considerably stronger measures.</p>
<p>At bottom, the Swedish strategy rests on a set of ethical positions that the government has chosen to adopt. These positions, in turn, look surprisingly like those staked out in Hägerström’s 1911 lecture. There is a clear line of influence running from the marmoreal halls of the university’s <em>aula </em>to the halls of power today. Although the materialism of our present society may suggest otherwise, ideas leave deep marks – a good example being precisely the materialism of our present society.</p>
<p>The title of the Hägerström’s historic 1911 lecture was “On the Truth of Ethical Utterances.” In it, the philosopher laid out something of a manifesto for the ethical position known as ethical non-cognitivism. He argued that any sentence expressing an ethical stance – any statement about what is good and what is bad – is necessarily nonsense. Asking whether an action is right or wrong, Hägerström assures us, is analogous to wondering about the amount of “justice” contained in a bar of gold, or how heavy a color happens to be. Ethical opinions are simply the reflection of personal emotions, and as such cannot be subject to either truth or falsehood.</p>
<p><em>Pace</em> my professor, Hägerström did, in fact, see his non-cognitivism as the cornerstone for a radical programme for political change. In “On the Truth of Ethical Utterances,” he describes his vision of a new ethics spawning to life from the ashes of the old one. This phoenix-like morality, having shed the fetters of metaphysics and superstition, would thereafter follow a single ethical lodestar: <em>functionality</em>. The effect of this approach was a practical utilitarianism: the goal of ethics in practice became to maximize the amount of utility for the greatest possible number. The scientific veneer of utilitarian ethics made it the perfect candidate for Hägerström’s post-metaphysical ethics of functionality. While it is nonsense to measure the “justice” of a gold ingot, it certainly makes a lot of sense to ask how much “utility” that gold can buy. Functionality is measurable; measurability is functional. Hägerström thus embodies the widely celebrated Swedish value of functionality. Indeed, it is no hyperbole to say that functionality is the country’s most cherished value. It also happens, slightly more worryingly, to be the only one.</p>
<p>The shockwaves of influence of Hägerström’s double-barreled approach of theoretical non-cognitivism coupled with a practical utilitarianism are too insidious to fully map. The ideas wormed their way into the official ideology of the Social-Democratic Party, which held an iron grip on Swedish politics for the better part of a century. Several of Hägerström’s students clambered up the party hierarchy and served long terms as ministers. The minister and economist Gunnar Myrdal, a disciple of Hägerström, described his master’s influence as ripples in water, expanding indefinitely until nobody was left unaffected. Hägerström’s students also became the architects behind Sweden’s “social engineering” programmes in the 1950s – government initiatives to streamline the population in order to increase its utility and functionality. “Social engineering” – or the project of shaping the “human-material”, as it was called – was (naturally) linked to comprehensive eugenic programmes. The Swedish pandemic strategy of achieving “herd immunity” (weeding out weaker individuals for the sake of “herd’s” utility) has a venerable history.</p>
<p>With this historical background in mind the reasoning behind the Swedish strategy becomes clearer, and, if anything, more appalling. At bottom, it is founded on a utilitarian calculus. Swedish authorities made no secret of the evaluation that needed to take place: one had to choose between the economy and the elderly, the unfettered functioning of society versus the health of its citizens – either justice or gold. The outcome of the calculations was clear: Sweden would opt for the alternative that maximizes utility across the board, even if in the process – as the euphemism goes – some eggs would need to be broken.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that utilitarian philosophers came out in force in defense of the Swedish strategy. As the Swedish ethicist Olle Torpman bluntly wrote back in April: “Can we really put a price tag on people’s lives? Can we really compare somebody’s death with another person’s happiness or lack thereof? The answer is: yes.”<sup><a href="#footnote_0_2556" id="identifier_0_2556" title="Olle Torpman, “Moralfilosofin som ger Sverige rätt” (“The Ethical Philosophy that Supports the Swedish Strategy”), Kvartal.">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Likewise, the internationally acclaimed utilitarian ethicist Torbjörn Tännsjö publicly defended the “Swedish strategy” precisely on the grounds of its palpably utilitarian texture. As he said in an interview: “It sounds as if the government is prepared to sacrifice a number of individuals – at any rate in the short term – to save as many human lives as possible on the whole, partly by indirectly saving the economy.”<sup><a href="#footnote_1_2556" id="identifier_1_2556" title="Åke Gavfelin and Lapo Lappin, “Interview with Torbjörn Tännsjö”, Metafysiskalaboratoriet.">2</a></sup> There is a more than a hint of triumphalism in Tännsjö’s defense: he cannot help but note that ethical boards across the country are spangled with his former doctoral students, who, he claims, do their best to dress up their utilitarianism enough to get away with it, while following it religiously in practice.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_2556" id="identifier_2_2556" title="Ibid.">3</a></sup></p>
<p>With all due respect to Tännsjö, if the utilitarianism is meant to be covert, his students are the least subtle players of hide-and-seek in the history of philosophy. Only a cursory glance at the ethical reports drawn up under the pandemic betrays an explicit utilitarianism. In a report on the Swedish approach, the Ethical Board of State laid out the ethical foundations to defend the strategy. This document follows through a rigorous utilitarian calculation, tallying up the greatest possible well-being for the greatest possible number. As the board writes in one official document: “To address the question [of which strategy should be chosen] we need to focus on the possible and relevant <em>consequences</em>.”<sup><a href="#footnote_3_2556" id="identifier_3_2556" title="The Swedish National Council on Medical Ethics, Etiska vägval i pandemin, 44.">4</a></sup> From the very outset, the question is formulated within a consequentialist ethical framework. The board goes on to list which such “relevant” consequences to be weighed against each other: they begin by noticing that one of these is the loss of lives, but are quick to dilute it with a much longer list, including social and psychological factors, proximate and remote economic factors, freedom, feelings of alienation. The cost of the state intervening to save lives, they suggest in one passage, must be weighed against the cost of the “support” for the government ebbing among the population.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_2556" id="identifier_4_2556" title="SMER, Etiska vägval i pandemin, 43-44.">5</a></sup></p>
<p>This calculation is, after all, perfectly in line with the pronouncements of the Ministry of Public Health; the strategy was repeatedly justified on the grounds that it allowed things to run smoothly: it was “sustainable” in the long run, as “effective” as possible.</p>
<p>A century after the Lutheran archbishop’s question to Hägerström, we are perhaps ready to suggest an answer. Whether or not we think a non-cognitivist and utilitarian father can be a decent father, it is certainly the case that a non-cognitivist and utilitarian state cannot be a decent state. We have yet to see any form of genuine remorse over the shedding of lives from those in positions of power. We may have a long wait ahead. After all, there can be no remorse for something one believes is entirely justified, even mandated, by an objective standard.</p>
<p>Perhaps the bottom line is that the cynicism of the Swedish strategy ought to raise as few eyebrows abroad as it does here in Sweden. In a society where the only value is utility, where vulnerable groups are expendable as long as the pay-off is high enough, where the values of human dignity and the holiness of life are regarded as metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, where gold will always trump justice, really – what else could one expect?<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

    <p><strong>Ethereum isn't fun anymore. There I said it.</strong> And although, the last time I developed an app using it has been more than a year ago, I stand by my word. <strong>Developing dapps on Ethereum has become annoying</strong>. Here's why:</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/pedro.gif"></p>
<h2 id="i-used-ethereum-before-it-was-cool.">I used Ethereum before it was cool.</h2>
<p>I know; it's such a hipster statement. But it's true. Ethereum has stopped being edgy. It has transitioned out of its niche to build a world computer. Its community has become huge, and I stopped knowing most faces. Where there was a feeling of revolution and new beginnings, now there are people in suits talking corporate. Within just a few years, it went from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DaddyDeFi/DaiDaddy">DAI daddys</a> and only <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.molochdao.com/">half-ironic satanist cults</a> to lending, insurance, and trade protocols.</p>
<p>"What's Ethereum's killer app?" we asked ourselves not long ago. Now we know. It's the world's best publicly-accessible settlement platform for financial transactions. In a way, that's exciting. The markets think so too. But for anyone else that worked with Ethereum but outside of financial applications, it's somewhat of a letdown.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/homer.gif"></p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-do-fellow-ethereans">How do you do, fellow Ethereans?</h2>
<p>I think it must have been around the time of the last big crypto bubble when Monero enthusiasts called for "Making Monero cheap again."</p>
<p>Monero, being the anonymous digital currency that had indeed just legit use cases apart from the occasional rumors that entangled it in drug trafficking, had suddenly become too expensive for everyday use. Realizing the glaring threat of becoming too valuable, its core developers went on to fix the problem by campaigning at CoinDesk's yearly industry gathering Consensus.</p>
<p>They announced the "Monero Enterprise Alliance." An inside joke, supposed to piss off other projects that had started to take themselves too seriously. Being slightly confused that day myself, I now can't recall if the effort had ever been successful. But in any case, I can't recommend buying Monero. It's useless.</p>
<h2 id="gas-prices-are-too-damn-high">Gas prices are too damn high!</h2>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/deepfried_high_rents.jpg"></p>
<p>There was a phase in my short career as an Ethereum developer where I looked at Etherscan's "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified">Verified Contracts</a>" page all day long to find vulnerabilities in newly uploaded contracts. "My name's Tim and I'm an etherholic!"</p>
<p>It was addictive. I ended up calling a few of those contracts, failing to cause any havoc, sadly. But it was so much fun! Back when transaction fees were still affordable on Ethereum, building projects was great. We started up Ganache and our favorite text editor (vim). The only choice we had was Solidity. And off we went.</p>
<p>Now, building Ethereum applications has become painful. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupid idea</a>. Layer 2 isn't ready. Neither is Eth 2.0. And there are still <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">many reasons to NOT ship to a Proof of Authority network</a>. Finally, gas prices are too damn high!</p>
<p>How do we move on from here?</p>
<h2 id="i-need-a-hero.">I need a hero.</h2>
<p><strong>I need a hero, and by that, I mean that I need a usable methodology for building scaleable decentralized apps.</strong> Yes, you've heard that right. We don't need more "Ethereum killers" that can do 10x more tx/s than Ethereum. Those are useless.</p>
<p>Instead, we need an approach for the average Joe developer to create their idea within the Ethereum ecosystem without the need for hardcore unproven technologies. I know, you Vitalik will say: "Oh, it's not a problem, we can has '<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html">Garbled Circuits</a>' and zkrollups." But I'm telling you that no sane Joe will touch that shit without a serious cryptographic specialist by their side.</p>
<p>We want what we stayed for initially: Good ol smart contracts. But right now, they're too damn expensive to innovate.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we think of reliability tools, we may overlook the humble checklist. While tools like <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a> represent the cutting edge of SRE, checklists have been recommended in many industries such as <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/38846186">surgery</a> and <a href="https://www.flightsafetyaustralia.com/2018/11/one-thing-at-a-time-a-brief-history-of-the-checklist/">aviation</a> for almost a century. But checklists owe this long and widespread adoption to their usefulness.<br></p><p>Checklists can also help limit errors when deploying code to production. In this blog post, we’ll cover:</p><ul role="list"><li>How to make a production checklist</li><li>Why production checklists are helpful</li><li>Keeping your checklist up to date</li><li>How Blameless can help integrate your checklists</li></ul><h2>How to make a production checklist</h2><p>Production checklists should be holistic. They should cover everything from launch logistics to contingency plans for failure. Let’s break down what you’ll need for a thorough checklist.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Determine the service level of what you’re launching</strong></li></ol><p>To determine <em>how thorough</em> your checklist should be, consider what level of reliability your customers need.. You may be tempted to be as comprehensive as possible with every checklist, but that costs time and may be unnecessary. At Mercari, <a href="https://github.com/mercari/production-readiness-checklist/blob/master/docs/references/production-readiness-level.md">the service level is determined based on the service’s SLO</a>. Services that are critical to business success are scrutinized more than niche services.</p><ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>Map out all the checklist areas</strong></li></ol><p>List all major components of your service. These components may be under the ownership of various teams. For example, you’ll likely need to consult server management teams, testing teams, and many others. It’s important to know as soon as possible whom you’ll need to consult. Some areas to consider include:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Server-side:</strong> What machines will this service run on? If you’re cloud-based, will your plan cover the new service’s load?</li><li><strong>Client-side:</strong> Is your service usable for all potential clients?</li><li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Do you have ways of collecting data from your new service?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Growth:</strong> Do you have a roadmap for how you will maintain or improve the service going forward? What if usage increases? What if you need to expand functionality?</li><li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> What other in-house and third party services does your service depend on? Will they integrate smoothly?</li><li><strong>Testing:</strong> Has the new service been tested in an environment mirroring production?</li><li><strong>Security: </strong>Will your new service pass your security audits?</li><li><strong>Reliability: </strong>What level of reliability will your users expect? Do you have a plan for when you are unable to meet these expectations?</li><li><strong>Incident response:</strong> What will you do if an incident causes service interruption or degradation? Do you have runbooks to cover these incidents?</li><li><strong>Legal:</strong> Do you have an SLA that guarantees availability? Does this service deal with personal information that must be kept secure?</li><li><strong>Logistics:</strong> What is the launch schedule? What resources will you need?<br></li></ul><p>For more examples of areas to consider, check out Google’s <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/launch-checklist/">Launch Coordination Checklist</a>, <a href="https://gruntwork.io/devops-checklist/">gruntwork.io’s AWS checklist</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/mercari/production-readiness-checklist/blob/master/docs/references/production-readiness-checklist.md">Mercari’s checklists</a>.</p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Prepare the checklist items</strong></li></ol><p>Each of these areas contains many issues, and requires data to answer. Your checklist should ask for each piece of data. Here’s an example of how certain sections could be broken down:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ec0224560bd6a6ef89a51ae/60258a189045532048064bce_GXLhui7pRZ_R7zLCqUunWS6CCU7PBwExUev_Aayj1ioz3UDZtZHnvyMOZNAsbRp1eugg8OC6Wjyl38autUOS0tlRm_wJkM3HjmEehUg3V1jnHf5gmUg-1ZX0DM0Z2G5dNlksxcM.png" alt="example areas, issues, and corresponding checklist items for a production readiness checklist."></p></figure><p>You may also want to include information on who to consult to check off each item, and the timeframe for being able to check it. Build your checklist and check items off as development progresses. Double check to ensure that items are ready to go. Right before launch, do a final check through the whole list, just in case.</p><h3>Keeping the checklist in check</h3><p>As you develop, you’ll likely find more areas you want to vet prior to launch. To keep your checklist from becoming too long, you’ll need a system to make sure new additions are helpful. <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/reliable-product-launches/">At Google</a>, teams have two criteria for adding an item to the checklist:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>“Every question’s importance must be substantiated, ideally by a previous launch disaster.”</li><li>“Every instruction must be concrete, practical, and reasonable for developers to accomplish.”<br></li></ul><p>You can determine criteria based on the service level you’ve assigned. It’s better to have an unnecessary item than to lack one you need. It’s okay to start with a big checklist, then remove items after each launch that proved to not be useful.</p><h2>Why are production checklists helpful?</h2><p>Production checklists can seemingly add overhead to engineers’ jobs. However, the upfront work can save teams from future problems and ensure a successful launch. Production checklists help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Remove the cognitive toil of having to remember everything</li><li>Identify possible problems ahead of time</li><li>Prepare resources ahead of time</li><li>Motivate development to complete necessary items</li><li>Prioritize key requirements vs unnecessary additions</li><li>Ensure contingency planning, improving reliability</li><li>Keep everyone in the loop throughout development as a centralized progress meter</li></ul><h2>How to keep your production checklist up to date</h2><p>You will need to review and revise your checklists periodically to keep them useful. Be sure to revisit them at these times:<br></p><p><strong>When development on a new service starts. </strong>When mapping out a new service, consider which production checklist to use when it launches. Based on the type of service and service level, find the closest checklist you have. Review it to make sure it follows the processes and architecture you currently use. Add any service-specific requirements as you develop.<br></p><p><strong>After a launch.</strong> Take a look at the production checklist after you launch the new service. Were there any problems with the launch? Could they have been checked for beforehand? Look for checklist items that were misunderstood and filled out incorrectly. Revise these items to ensure the checklist lines up with the reality of development.<br></p><p><strong>After an incident. </strong>If an incident impacts the new service, see if any of the contributing factors could have been addressed with the checklist If so, try to capture those items on future checklists. This task can be incorporated into your <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-retrospective-postmortem-template">incident retrospectives</a>.<br></p><p><strong>As part of regular review cycles.</strong> Set a schedule to review tools like runbooks and production checklists. Make sure to invite all team members who will be required to use these runbooks or checklists. Each of these people can provide insight on what to improve moving forward.</p><h2>How Blameless can help integrate checklists</h2><p>To get the most from your checklists, you need to integrate them into your workflows.

</p>
<br>


<p><em>J-U-S-T</em>. Those four characters can be significantly detrimental to a software development process. In this blog post, I’ll describe how the <em>“just keyword”</em> can affect team’s communication and how to avoid misusing it on Slack.</p>
<h2 id="lets-just-do-it">Let’s “just” do it</h2>
<p>You’ve probably been there. Your product manager shares his brand new plan on the Slack channel:</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t we</em> <strong>just</strong> <em>add this cool new feature to our application?”</em></p>
<p>or your colleague got the wrong idea about scaling after reading a HackerNews story:</p>
<p><em>“Let’s</em> <strong>just</strong> <em>migrate our infrastructure to Kubernetes…“</em></p>
<p><em>“Just”</em> is toxic and dangerous. It implicitly suggests that the proposed task is straightforward. It undermines the discussion about the issues that might pop-up during the implementation.</p>
<p>There’s no <em>“just”</em> in software development. Most of the tasks turn out to be more complex than anticipated. <em>“Just tickets”</em> tend to drag, evolve into epics, miss deadlines and hurt the team’s motivation.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this topic discussed many times before. Make sure to check out <a href="https://alistapart.com/blog/post/the-most-dangerous-word-in-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these two</a> <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-january-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a> for a more in-depth description of it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-slack-to-get-rid-of-just-tickets">How to use Slack to get rid of “Just tickets”</h2>
<p>I want to propose a solution to the <em>“Just”</em> problem. Lexically there’s never a need to include the word <em>“just”</em> in a sentence. You can always omit it without altering the core meaning of your message.</p>
<p>You could discourage using the word <em>“just”</em> in communication. Slack offers a simple feature that will let you automate it. Introducing Slackbot triggers:</p>
<p><img alt="Slack keyword trigger in action" title="Slack keyword trigger in action" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-keyword-trigger-40d3219d92fe2bee0932a832ff7c80608c9b99a067f704347ed564dec917bc1e.png"></p>
<p>Slack trigger in action</p>

<p>You can configure Slack to automatically send a custom message whenever a <em>trigger</em> keyword is detected. In settings, go to <strong>Customize &gt; Slackbot</strong> and enter your desired trigger and response.
<br></p>
<p><img alt="Slack trigger settings" title="Slack trigger settings" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-trigger-settings-3456bc59b61b75a27c245690b2d0a5d57afd8e2ac535027c9d01e3a87c54cffb.png"></p>
<p>Slack trigger settings</p>

<p>It could be pretty spammy to start with, but your team should quickly adjust and stop using the <em>forbidden</em> keyword. If someone does use it, the alert message will be a fun reminder to stop and think twice if the <em>“just”</em> idea is really that simple.</p>
<p>So why won’t you just give this communication experiment a try?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The most popular products don’t become mass popular overnight. It’s a process. Usually, their popularity is uneven, they are unknown in some niches, but very popular in other niches.</p><p>When you start a product, sometimes you know the niche already and can easily define target customers. However, in many cases, you just don’t and try to find the niche and this miraculous niche-market-fit. </p><p>One of the most common mistakes is to ignore niches and just try to attract all kinds of customers. It’s essential to find 1-2 ponds to start from and then expand to the other, larger, and more promising lakes and oceans 🚰 → 🛁 → 🌊.</p><p>Here are a couple, maybe surprising examples, that demonstrate how popular products took off. </p><h4>Electrical telegraph (1837)</h4><p>Its adoption was not easy, since it was not clear what are the benefits for commercial institutions. Stockbrokers and reporters got the benefits first. They understood that fast information transition increases efficiency and helps to get an edge. In a short term, all major news agencies and major stock markets were connected to the telegraph. </p><h4>Telephone (1876)</h4><p>Telephones were adopted by police departments and fire stations. Fast reaction to crime reports and fires was great, but the telegraph was not enough. You have to have two-ways communication to get some details that the sender maybe is not expecting to report initially. </p><h4>Phonograph (1877)</h4><p>Try to guess the first niche market for the phonograph. Rich music lovers? Nope. First phonographs were coin-machines in bars. Throw a nickel and enjoy Stephen Foster ballads.</p><h4>Car (1886)</h4><p>Cars are almost among the lucky exception to the niche rule. However, there was still one group of people in the USA that moved from horses to cars enormously fast — farmers. Cars just expanded the borders of farmers’ social life and business activities. Suddenly you can buy goods, not from a local dealer, but a dealer in a remote town (much cheaper). Suddenly you can visit a town and watch a movie. These benefits were not important for the urban population, for they were life-changers for the rural population. Nevertheless, cars were adopted in cities quite fast as well.</p><blockquote><p>In addition, the car delivered you to the door and was faster than a horse-and-buggy, thus allowing longer trips in shorter time. Farmers had traditionally felt guilty about taking such trips, even when the time was available. </p></blockquote><h4>Radio (1895)</h4><p>Radio was immediately adopted by the British Royal Navy, they thought that radio can speed up communication between ships and were right. Fun fact: in 1912 Titanic sent CQD (distress signal), however, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/why-titanic-first-call-help-not-sos-signal">radio receiver was turned off on the closest ship</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the closest ship, Californian, didn’t receive Titanic’s distress calls at all. Its wireless operator had switched off his receiver and gone to bed after Phillips told him to shut up.</p></blockquote><h4>VisiCalc (Excel predecessor, 1979)</h4><p>First, it was adopted by accountants. Businessmen and analysts joined the party much later. Accountants just saw the value right away (and quite many people pirchased Apple II just to get <a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-visicalcs-spreadsheets-changed-the-world/">VisiCalc</a>):</p><blockquote><p>Like an accountant, I remember showing it to one around here and he started shaking and said, “That’s what I do all week. I could do it in an hour.” … I meet these people now, they come up to me and say, “I gotta tell you, you changed my life. You made accounting fun.”</p></blockquote><h4>Facebook (2004)</h4><p>Everybody knows that Facebook got its popularity in universities first. Everybody knows the rest of the story.</p><blockquote><p>Within 24 hours, 1,200 Harvard students had signed up, and after one month, over half of the undergraduate population had a profile. The network was promptly extended to other Boston universities, the Ivy League and eventually all US universities</p></blockquote><hr><p>Can you start without any niche in mind? Yes, you can, but this is just hard. The most problematic part is marketing. Who are your ideal customers? How to reach them? How to target your message? <strong>Product is the message</strong>, so without proper marketing startup success chances are low. </p><h4>My experience</h4><p>In Fibery we did our first release in April 2020 as a general work management tool. We were not sure in what types of companies it will work better and what use cases will be more valuable. In just a month it became clear that we had all kinds of leads from all kinds of companies. Leads demanded all kinds of improvements that just didn’t form a sane strategy. </p><p>We quickly <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/chronicles-21/">decided to select a single niche and focus on it</a>. The niche we choose was product companies from 20 to 200 people. And it made everything much simpler. Finally, we can quite accurately say what features are important and what features are not so important, what is our value proposition, who is our ideal lead (Product Ops or CPO). It took us 9 months to prepare the <a href="https://fibery.io/product-management">second release</a>, but in this niche Fibery can fly much better, I believe. </p><p>OK, niche strategy looks convincing, but how to find the niche? We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway’s law</a>, and it’s just partially a joke. We’ve reviewed a couple of alternatives and selected one we knew best and were confident that our product will provide a significant value boost. There were other alternatives, like education space or digital agencies space, but our knowledge here was not deep enough. It means we should rely on some domain experts, etc. It’s not a huge problem, but we also did not feel that these niches are better.</p><p>A startup should be an experimentation facility that hypothesizes, executes, and measures the results. The faster you can do it, the faster you find your niche. Why it took us 9 months to make this niche release? In fact we spend time to create a niche-probing framework. Now we can asseble solutions for various niches in 1-2 weeks and check initial response in 1-2 months. If the first niche will not be successful, we at least have a decent experimentation framework 🧬.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		    
<p>One of the fallacies about our collective approach to retrospectives, incident reviews, and post mortems is the belief that the entire process is a rational machine. Pour in a curated series of events, turn the handle, and out pop all of the action items that need completing to fix the world. I can’t speak to every industry that practices Resilience Engineering, but as for Software Engineering it stems strongly from our belief that we’re fully in control of our environment. We’ve built our tooling, architected our systems, and we’re running the retro. Why wouldn’t we be able to simply apply the calculus to our knowledge and change things for the better?</p>



<p>This all speaks to a distinct lack of humility in what we do as a practice. If we want to better understand the risks we undertake every day and to learn from failures in that work, we need to first accept that failures are in part due to our incomplete understanding, great and small, of our socio-technical systems. Even with a complete working knowledge of everything, we would be unable to act on everything needed to perfect our system, and that underlying system will change despite these efforts. Being comfortable with being wrong means we can change.</p>



<p>This reluctance to accept that things continually fail despite our best efforts, is a common reaction. It’s hard to assume that our systems are continuously in need of tweaks because it’s also hard to accept that they will always run in some form of a degraded state<sup><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#complex-systems-run-in-degraded-mode" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. That said, we can fall into the adjacent trap with people being the adaptable element in the system<sup><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#human-practitioners-are-the-adaptable-element" target="_blank">2</a></sup> that we are then in the best position to understand the entirety of our system and how best to course correct. The sharp end can be a powerful, if not perilous, position to sit in but it doesn’t guarantee omniscience in the scope of understanding an incident. This is why I frequently suggest that practitioners of retrospectives be folks who weren’t involved in the incident, to help mitigate this failing.</p>



<h2>Hubris as Facilitator</h2>



<p>It’s easy to understand the desire to sit in the facilitator chair. You’re taking the reins of the situation and you’re going to get to the bottom of things. You ask the questions, you drive the conversation and schedule the meeting, but most importantly you’re going to be there to get answers. That would be true if you held a made up title like investigation commander or retrospective captain, but you’re don’t. A facilitator is less the spike and more the bump/set. You’re there to position other folks to learn, not wear the badge.</p>



<p>Retros also come in various shapes and sizes, which makes for another tempting place to be in control. If I’m running the retro, then it can follow my guidelines and my preferred flow. This lesson I learned the hard way, having felt as though I knew “the one true way” to run it. I was there at Etsy watching John Allspaw, Morgan Evans, and Daniel Schauenberg develop and put ink to paper with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extfiles.etsy.com/DebriefingFacilitationGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Etsy Debriefing Guide</a>. In doing so, though, I failed to recognize the microcosm that was Etsy, that what worked for us there didn’t apply universally. Maybe folks had other tools worth surfacing and we should continually look to that to see how we can improve the production of our retros.</p>



<p>Facilitators should instead be the support for everyone else to do the talking and ask questions of their own. We can only share that deep empathy with one another when we put ourselves in one another’s shoes and that can only be done with the understanding of our own fallibility. We too know how awful it feels to be at the center of an incident, that it could have easily been us, which allows us to help recreate the scene and ditch concepts like “human error” as an easy solution to a complex problem.</p>



<p>A singular view of the problem, from that up on high as facilitator, will produce a singular set of answers constrained by our myopic vantage point.</p>



<h2>Top Down Misunderstanding of Retrospectives</h2>



<p>Another failure in our work running retrospectives is senior leadership (individual contributors and management both) using them to impart the illusion of work being done. You’ll see this often in email chains that include a CC list that races its way up the reporting structure. This incident was unacceptable, but don’t worry, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKTBHuRv9U" target="_blank">we have top men working on it right now</a>. Similarly, you’ll see public facing reports sent out by companies to reassure customers, the board of directors, and investors that all is well. It’s worth noting that there is value in shared perception being a useful tool for a business to leverage, but it still doesn’t impart learning to folks on either side of the boundaries of a company. The learning review is downgraded for the sake of making an org, at the macro or micro level, appear to be invulnerable to failure. The company cannot tolerate failure because vulnerability must be made an impossibility.</p>



<p>It’s also why so many existing tools are marketed with a primary focus on action items as the work. Going into a retro with the principal desire to create a ToDo list is problematic because the learning becomes a secondary function by nature of prioritization. It has roots in humility such that we’re going into our discussions and interviews believing we can simply solve all the problems in tech and then everything will be perfect from here on, the deeper understanding a “nice to have”.</p>



<p>This is not to give individual contributors in senior positions a pass. How often do we rely on “This is the way we’ve always done it” and our use of best practices<sup><a href="#can-we-trust-best-practices">4</a></sup> as a crutch for decision making rather than challenge established methods? We give folks in senior positions more time for questions during discussions and put them at the front to answer for the sake of expedience. Equally, holding a blameless post mortem can fail if an org values engineers who prioritize their place in the pecking order rather than risk losing face in front of others. Giving less experienced folks time to explore ideas tests the validity of our mental models.</p>



<p>Most importantly, for us to build and revise adaptive capacity<a href="#building-and-revising-adaptive-capacity"><sup>3</sup></a> we have to first acknowledge that the map of our system is potentially inaccurate, a map that is heavily influenced top down. Until we can move towards an acceptance of inaccuracies in our understanding, our assumption stands that we must be right and the view should not change. All of these concepts, and our own journey to them, are themselves a <em>work in progress</em>. There are soft boundaries and holes in the middle where our language and understanding fails us. This does not inherently diminish our work, but can in fact enhance it.</p>



<h2>Humility In Practice</h2>



<p>It’s a fairly given criticism that a lot of our work in applying Resilience Engineering and Human Factors concepts to Software Engineering fail to give concrete examples of putting theory to practice, often leaving it as an exercise to the reader. With that in mind, what does humility first in a retro look like?</p>



<ul><li><strong>A retrospective is a safe place to say “I don’t know”.</strong> A facilitator can and should actively say just that while encouraging others who exhibit similar misgivings about what they can safely hold true. By doing so, it establishes a pattern of being ok with the discomfort of uncertainty.</li><li><strong>Retros should prioritize learning before fixing.</strong> This is not infrequently stated, but bears repeating. As said elsewhere, it also doesn’t exclude action items. Rather, allow folks to freely express what they don’t understand without shame and for improvements to extend from these learning experiences.</li><li><strong>A generosity of spirit is key.</strong> Participants should hold a respect to time shared for other folks to learn, with a particular emphasis on the facilitator. As invaluable as your time is, the up front cost of interviewing folks, organizing meetings, and gathering information is paramount. Put in the extra effort to interview before a retro meeting and follow up after to tie up loose ends.</li><li><strong>There should be a reduction (not an absence) on our use of hindsight.</strong> Acknowledging that we’re all fallible means we can resist the inclination to “fix” an error with counterfactuals when we review past events. Look backwards not as a way to save face but to explore why ideas previously made sense.</li><li><strong>The malleable nature of a retrospective is to review what is assumed to be true.</strong> Confirm or refute assumptions on the narrative as it is assumed to exist regardless of who shares it. Some folks may not be in a position to share, internal pressures against them. Insights often comes from the sharp end, which isn’t always the most tenured engineer.</li><li><strong>All participants should be on equal footing.</strong> Retros are akin to a round table discussion where folks come to share events and ask questions, rather than seniority or management directing the events as to how it may best serve their own interests or those assumed to be of the organization. Don’t let titles dictate who gets to speak.</li><li><strong>Our work in retrospectives is ongoing and adaptable.</strong> Before practitioners get too set in their ways, we should remember that Resilience is a verb<sup><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://willgallego.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=529&amp;action=edit#resilience-is-a-verb" target="_blank">5</a></sup>. Templates are more rigid and predefined, but allowing ourselves the chance to break out of molds, to make mistakes, and explore the boundaries with the assurance that failure is ok, we can practice new ways of pulling out sources of information from our incidents. Our meta discussions surrounding incidents should themselves be challenged.</li></ul>

<p>After big-tech censorship silenced social media company Parler on January 11, 2020, they are back online with new servers as well as new leadership.</p>



<p>Over one month ago Amazon Web Services removed Parler from their servers, taking them offline.&nbsp; Google and Apple also removed them from their app stores. &nbsp; They claimed that the platform was used to “incite, organize, and coordinate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.”</p>



<p>Defense and National Guard officials, including now former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, have stated in interviews that federal law enforcement authorities indicated there was activity relating to the organizing of the Capitol attack on Twitter also.</p>



<p>Parler execs said it was a war on free speech, and Amazon stated that requests to remove violent content, including death threats against public figures were ignored.</p>



<p>In addition, their co-founder and CEO, John Matze was terminated by their board on January 29 over differences in company visions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parler’s interim CEO Mark Meckler told<a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/culture/welcome-back-parler-resumes-social-media-app-after-securing-new-computer-servers?utm_source=breaking-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter#article"> Just the News</a> that “20 million users who were already using the app can begin logging back in on Monday, and new users should be able to sign up in approximately one week.”</p>



<p>“He also said the platform is using artificial intelligence and human editors to police for illegal speech that violates its service agreement but otherwise is remaining true to its free speech, no censorship roots.”</p>



<p>According to his<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMeckler?s=20"> Twitter</a> account, Meckler is the President of the Convention of States Project, Co-Founder and former National Coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, Constitutional Revolutionary, Husband, Father, and Son.</p>



<p>“Parler is being run by an experienced team and is here to stay,” Meckler said in a statement. “We will thrive as the premier social media platform dedicated to free speech, privacy and civil dialogue.”</p>



<p>There are still some issues with the platform as many people are reporting the site is still not accessible, but it seems their return is imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the vulnerability reporting process that took place after Sakura Samurai had breached the Indian Government</p><p>Reading time: 6 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>Sakura Samurai knew that the Indian Government operated an RVDP (Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program). <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> put a list together of initial assets in scope for Sakura Samurai to legally test. <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> reported that he had found sensitive data and was able to breach police assets. <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> was working in the enumeration processes with his friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001" title="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001">Zultan Holder</a> [not an active Sakura Samurai member] and identified a slew of various attack vectors, immediately resulting in the exposure of many pairs of credentials for databases and other pertinent applications.</p>
<p>The team was informed of the initial enumeration results as they continued to work on the list of assets within scope, while also further jumping into the research and began performing analysis on the sensitive data, identifying additional vectors of attack, exposed PII, and even more credentials.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai team members included <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a>, and<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking"> John Jackson</a></p>
<p>In total, the following vulnerabilities were identified, in no specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 Separate Instances of Exposed Credential Pairs (Servers, Important Applications, etc)</li>
<li>3 Instances of Sensitive File Disclosure</li>
<li>5 Exposed private-key pairs for servers</li>
<li>13K+ PII Records [and those are only the records that we were inadvertently exposed to]</li>
<li>Dozens of Exposed Sensitive Police Reports</li>
<li>Session Hijacking Chained via Multiple Vulnerabilities, resulting in the compromise of extremely sensitive government systems</li>
<li>Remote Code Execution on a sensitive financial server; a server that contained large backups of Financial Records</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, it is important to note that so many Critical findings had been identified during our testing that we cannot possibly include all of the vulnerabilities without making this writeup unnecessarily heavy. Therefore, we have opted to include small snippets of repetitive findings in this section.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> identified an application that resulted in a vulnerability that allowed him to access Sensitive Police Records, containing PII of individuals listed on the report. In addition, sample forensic reports and forensic tooling that is used by the police department was identified by Willis. The exposure of citizen’s sensitive information, some being victims, is a sensitive subject within itself and highly alarming.</p>

<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police2.png" alt=""><br>
Shortly after, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> found a vulnerability that resulted in the exposure of 14,000+ user records. The records included a wide range of sensitive information, including full name, contact info, employee’s department, date of birth, etc. These exposed records along with other various SQL server dumps and Rob’s Police Record Exposure is enough to constitute a data breach without even logging into any of the servers.</p>
<p>Henry identified many credential pairs which could have resulted in even more exploitation of many other people. The PII identified is a small sample of a much larger issue.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> was able to identify a relevant Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, affecting an out-of-date application residing on one of the government servers. The remote code execution vulnerability allowed for complete access to sensitive files on the server, including the ability to exfiltrate complete backups of financial records [although data exfiltration wasn’t performed to avoid unnecessary action]</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce1.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce2.png" alt=""><br>
Finally, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a> identified the presence of what appeared to be an extremely important application being hosted by the same server that John had achieved successful Remote Code Execution on. Cottle then chained together multiple vulnerabilities in conjunction with the Remote Code Execution vulnerability, resulting in the ability to hijack any user’s session on the web application. The application contained troves of sensitive government data and could have given a threat actor the ability to perform highly-critical, admin-based government actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/session-chained.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Even though the Indian Government has a RVDP in place, we didn’t feel comfortable disclosing the vulnerabilities right away. The hacking process was far from the standard situation of business-as-usual security research. In total, our report compounded to a massive 34 page report worth of vulnerabilities. We knew that our intent was good, but we wanted to ensure that the US Government had eyes on the situation. Sakura Samurai coordinated with the <a href="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP" title="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP">U.S. DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)</a> to assist in facilitating initial conversations of disclosure. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> spoke with DC3’s Program Manager via email and coordinated on a plan of action.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-1.png" alt=""><br>
Roughly 4 days later, after further communication with the DC3, we felt safe to begin our initial reveal of research on the NCIIPC’s RVDP program.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, the DC3 also commended the hacking that we did in support of making the cyberspace a better place for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, what seemed like a done deal turned out to be quite the unprofessional ride. Any organization knows that fixing breach-worthy vulnerabilities is extremely time sensitive. Once threat actors catch wind of major vulnerabilities against an organization they begin poking on their own, looking for more vectors of attack. Immediately upon revealing that Sakura Samurai was the group responsible for hacking the Indian Government, we followed up with them via Email.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>2021/02/04</strong> - DC3 begins initial contact with the Indian Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai informs the public that they breached the Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai makes contact with the NCIIPC, noting that the report that they received was a result of their research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - The NCIIPC responds, with a basic acknowledgement and thank you for the research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - Sakura Samurai asks for clarification on patching and the responsibility of breach disclosure to the public.<br>
<strong>2021/02/10</strong> - Sakura Samurai, having received no response, asks for an update on the involved remediation and breach notification processes.<br>
<strong>2021/02/16</strong> - Sakura Samurai once again asks for NCIIPC’s plans for remediation and disclosure.<br>
<strong>2021/02/17</strong> - The NCIIPC makes contact, 7-days later, stating that they will follow up in a short time. Again, we ask about plans of anticipated patching and breach notification to the affected citizens.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - In the morning, we ask again about patching and disclosure, 8-hours later and still no response on the matter.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - Sakura Samurai reviews the submitted vulnerability report and notes that only about an eighth or less of the submitted Critical Vulnerabilities have been resolved within a two-week period. No notification of breach has occurred even though Government Employees and Indian Citizens are at risk of exploitation from threat actors.</p>

<p>Governments have an obligation to protect the private data of its employees and citizens. In addition, the exposure of proprietary government data can be used for great means of manipulation and for other destructive purposes. While the NCIIPC operates a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program, the recklessness and avoidance of communication represents the complete opposite of a responsible program. A failure to release notification of breach to affected citizens and to patch highly-critical vulnerabilities in a timely manner reflects poorly on the state of their Information Security posture. The clock to patch vulnerabilities began immediately when the DC3 contacted the NCIIPC via Twitter, as it is a highly visible space - one which threat actors avidly monitor.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai urge the NCIIPC to patch the remainder of the vulnerabilities. The criticality of some of the issues cannot wait weeks or months for adequate resolution.</p>

<p>Whenever a software project needs to implement immutable records, people often start thinking of Blockchain or <strong>D</strong>istributed <strong>L</strong>edger <strong>T</strong>echnology like Hyperledger. Blockchain and DLT make use of cryptographic techniques that enable immutability, verifiability and integrity checks. However, Blockchain and DLT need much more than just these checks. It needs to prevent all the attempts of a double-spend by potential malicious users. In a trust-less environment it needs implementation of complex protocols which leads to consumption of huge amount of electricity. This makes writing data on Blockchain costly. DLTs like Hyperledger make use of simpler consensus algorithms between a “set of trusted nodes”, which reduces the cost. However, it still incurs significant costs if nothing more than immutability, verifiability and integrity were the concern.</p>



<p>This post is about how to implement data immutability, verifiability and integrity without using a Blockchain or a DLT in industrial strength software applications.</p>

<h2 id="foundation">Foundational technique – Cryptographic Hashing</h2>



<p>To understand the solution, some foundational techniques must be understood. This section describes what is cryptographic hashing. Those who are already aware of cryptographic hashing, they may skip to the next section.</p>



<h4 id="hash-function">Cryptographic hash function</h4>



<p>If you provide a stream of bytes to a cryptographic hash function, it generates a number called hash (also referred to as digest). The following properties make it a very useful tool:</p>



<ol><li>It is impossible to guess the generated hash value for a stream of bytes. To get the hash value, one has to run the algorithm, there is no shortcut.</li><li>For a given input it always generates the same hash value.</li><li>It is infeasible to deduce the input based on the hash value. That means it is an irreversible mathematical function.</li><li>No two different stream of bytes result in the same hash value. Even a small change in the input stream generates a totally different number.&nbsp;<em>(When two different stream of bytes produce the same hash value, we say the cryptographic hash function is broken. It is also referred to as there is a collision in the cryptographic hash function.)</em></li><li>Any size of input stream will always result in the same size of hash value. Some hash functions generate hash values that are 256 bits long. If those functions are used, the result will always be 256 bits long.</li></ol>



<p>Examples of commonly used cryptographic hash functions include:</p>



<ul><li>SHA-256 (returns 256 bit&nbsp;unsigned integers)</li><li>RIPEMD-160 (returns 160 bit unsigned integers)</li></ul>



<p>Sample hash values:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Input</strong></td><td><strong>SHA-256</strong></td><td><strong>RIPEMD-160</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hello world</td><td>0x64ec88ca00b268e5ba1a35678a1b5316d212f4f366b2477232534a8aeca37f3c</td><td>0xdbea7bd24eef40a2e79387542e36dd408b77b21a</td></tr><tr><td>Hello world.</td><td>0xaa3ec16e6acc809d8b2818662276256abfd2f1b441cb51574933f3d4bd115d11</td><td>0x6ad34a17d22d67a7ab02710ae9eb6f282cb1d787</td></tr><tr><td>Unrelated, totally.</td><td>0x2bd72f5c4300444890325b3363ef2027f30ed38797c3133dbc62a90564976458</td><td>0x51cb1844d22a00d5f659795e0b1c339c6fa1a8bc</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Hex representation of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash values for different inputs</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are two things we observe from the table above:</p>



<ol><li>With a slight change in input, the hash values change dramatically and by looking only at the hash values, one cannot conclude&nbsp;that&nbsp;the first and second are&nbsp;even closely related. This is also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avalanche effect</a>. It is one of requirements of a cryptographic algorithms to have the avalanche effect.</li><li>The values mentioned are actually text strings and do not look like numbers, although we expected them to be numbers.</li></ol>



<p>They are actually numbers, represented this way to reduce the size of the presented text. For example, binary representation of the number 255&nbsp;is ‘11111111’. Decimal representation is ‘255’. Hexadecimal representation is ‘ff’ or ‘FF’. The representations in the table above are hexadecimal representations of 32 byte and 20 byte numbers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">base64encoding</a> is commonly used to represent the hash values in cryptographic applications.</p>



<h2 id="verifiability">Verifiability</h2>



<p>For quite some time, open source software has been distributed through various mirror sites so that downloads are sped up. Any user could download the software package quickly from a nearby mirror site. These nearby sites could be malicious and could provide compromised open source software packages. In order to overcome this problem, open source software builds would publish a checksum file on their website. This checksum file is used to verify that the downloaded package from a nearby mirror site is authentic. The checksum file actually contains a cryptographic hash of the software package.</p>



<p>For example: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums/3.4.1_checksums.html" target="_blank">Apache OpenOffice – Download checksum files</a>.</p>



<pre>e08f9c8acecba1ee0046f820b0abed97dfe90511bd733a65936fdf0ea9c22540  Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz</pre>



<p>This is the content from SHA256 checksum file for <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/files/stable/3.4.1/Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz.sha256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Open Office SDK for Linux x86-64</a> build.</p>



<p>It would not matter which mirror site the SDK is downloaded from. A user can easily verify the authenticity of the download using a simple command like:</p>



<pre><code>$ sha256sum Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz
e08f9c8acecba1ee0046f820b0abed97dfe90511bd733a65936fdf0ea9c22540  Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz</code></pre>



<p>If the generated SHA256 does not match with the checksum file, the user knows that the software package has been tampered.</p>



<p>We will use the same technique to verify data objects. The data object we are interested in would have an ID. Any application or service asks for objects using IDs. If the data that the application gets does not generate the same hash value as the ID, then the application can easily conclude that the data is not what was asked for or the data has mutated. On a typical hardware the cryptographic hash function would take a few microseconds to generate the hash value. So, this is not costly and offers good verifiability.</p>



<p>In the context of this post, the verifiability that we are seeking is not because we operate in a trust-less or adversarial environment like Blockchains, but mainly because data can become corrupt or can be deliberately changed by hackers / attackers. This is for companies to verify that the data they hold has not been modified undesirably.</p>



<h4 id="verify-id">Application: Deterministic and Verifiable IDs</h4>



<p>In a typical RESTful request, a client posts a request to a service, and the service returns back an ID. The service uses the ID to index the object that got created due to the request. However, with a predetermined ID generation technique, it is possible for the client to know the ID even before the service receives the request. This is done even in blockchains. The transactionID (also referred as <a href="https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/TXID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TXID</a>) is a hash computed from certain fields of a transaction request.</p>



<p>To be able to know the ID of an object that will be returned by a service even before the object is created in a service has significant benefits. </p>



<ol><li>Just by computing the ID from the fields of an object, and comparing it with the ID provided in the object, one can determine if the object is the right object. Housekeeping processes can easily determine data corruption or software bugs or potential attacks.</li><li>Request need not be processed synchronously.</li><li>The client can fire a batch of requests in just one call. Each individual request can easily be identified by the request id which will be deterministic for both the client and the service. This eliminates the need to create IDs on the client side, and map them to the server side IDs.</li><li>Non-idempotent requests such as HTTP POST requests can achieve deterministic behaviour. Multiple POST requests (which could be because of software bug or infrastructural replays) will not cause harm, as the request ID is predetermined. The server can easily identify a duplicate request.</li></ol>



<p>Example: To generate an OrderID, one could take the sha256 of a series of bytes of the quantity, price, dateTime of the order, clientID, and the assetID or assetSymbol.</p>



<pre><code>OrderID = sha256(bytes(qty)||bytes(price)||bytes(dateTime)||bytes(clientID)||bytes(assetID))</code></pre>



<h4 id="data-format">Data format and ID Generation</h4>



<p>While the scheme above for ID generation works, it has a certain drawback. For every type of objects, a developer would have to write an ID generator. This is not desirable. For a majority of the types of objects, the id generator should just be available easily. For this, the object itself can be serialised and the serialised stream of bytes can be hashed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that text based data structures like JSON, XML are not very well suited for this. The main reason behind this is that adding a space or TAB within the document will not alter the data for JSON or XML, however will yield a totally different hash value and therefore a totally different object ID. Hence, it is better to use serialisation formats designed for cross platform, multiple language environments and are deterministic. Compact data serialisation like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/" target="_blank">FlatBuffers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://avro.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Avro</a> and even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049" target="_blank">CBOR</a> are much better suited for this.</p>



<h2 id="immutability">Immutability and Verifiability</h2>



<p>Software professionals often jump to Blockchain to achieve immutability even in a non-adversarial environment like most business applications. Any party explicitly trying to cheat would face the court, and fraudulent transactions can be reverted in the most common business applications seen throughout the world. Therefore, there is no need for all the complexity and consensus algorithms like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Even on DLTs there are algorithms like Raft which are used to achieve consensus. Although much lesser in the power consumption, raft could still be an overkill for some …</p></div></div>

<p>Consider a trio of moments of entangled spacetime:</p>



<p>Jan. 7, 2021, cyberspace and Washington, D.C.: A staggering 4,112 people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/coronavirus-deaths.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">die</a> of the coronavirus in America, a new record. Elon Musk becomes the richest person in the world and reiterates his plan to leave Earth and start a colony on Mars.</p>



<p>Dec. 7, 1972, near-Earth orbit: The crew of <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a002600/a002680/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Apollo 17</a>, 18,000 miles from home and on their way to the moon, snap a photograph of Earth. Illuminated by the sun and nestled in the sable sea of outer space, the “Blue Marble” image becomes a resonant icon of humans’ dear and fragile life-filled planet. Earth’s denizens wonder: Are there other worlds beyond? Or is this the only example of life in the universe?</p>



<p>Nov. 7, 1957, Calcutta, India: Two prominent biologists, Joshua Lederberg and J.B.S. Haldane, meet for dinner. A month earlier, the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Lederberg and Haldane <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/bb/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584906X13253-doc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">determine</a> that a thermonuclear bomb detonated on the moon would be visible to Earthlings, and it would be so destructive it would spoil the possibility of finding traces of lunar life.</p>



<p>Lifted from three interspaced epochs of the ongoing Space Age — the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental movement and the Cold War — those moments reveal how terrestrial troubles are entwined with hopes of discovering life, and of living, beyond Earth. As dreams to explore the cosmos curl skyward, fears and anxieties particular to each moment raise doubts not only about humans’ longevity on our home planet, but also about how we might inhabit and sustain life on other worlds as space-faring explorers. If humans self-destruct through nuclear war, poison the planet by churning out carbon into the atmosphere or fail to control a deadly virus, such events would preclude us from existing on Earth, living long enough to communicate with possible extraterrestrial beings and venturing to other worlds we might discover to be habitable.</p>



<p>Thus, fears of terrestrial apocalypse animate pursuits for life and living beyond Earth. But conversely, imagining how life (including human life) might exist in an extraterrestrial context, and seeing the planet from outer space, has driven imaginations of Earth’s possible futures — both hopeful, course-correcting pathways, but also escapist fantasies of extraplanetary colonization.</p>



<p>Anticipations of worlds <em>beyond</em> Earth — places that might be (or might be made to be) habitable — are made possible by conceiving <em>of</em> Earth as both threatened and interconnected: The coronavirus’s march across the world reveals the viruses’ disregard for political borders, the environmental movement highlighted the fragility of the planet’s entangled life and the Cold War ushered in the concept of global nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>These threats have, in different ways, revealed how actions are never self-contained in global, networked systems. Each moment’s particular planetary anxieties — pathogenic, climate, nuclear — have animated and informed scientists’ pursuit of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h5><strong>Annihilation</strong></h5>



<p>On Oct. 4, 1957, Sputnik I streaked across the sky. Touching off the “space race” between the United States and the Soviet Union, the satellite represented the opposition between democracy and communism. “Artificial earth satellites will pave the way to interplanetary travel,” the Communist Party’s official newspaper <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/14.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the following day, and “our contemporaries will witness how the freed and conscientious labor of the people of the new socialist society makes the most daring dreams of mankind a reality.”</p>



<p>Sputnik I was particularly visible from the southern hemisphere, where Nobel Prize-winning microbiologist Joshua Lederberg happened to be traveling. A month later, on his way back to Stanford University, where he taught and researched, Lederberg passed through Calcutta to visit his friend and collaborator J.B.S. Haldane. Haldane had formulated the “<a href="https://www.uv.es/~orilife/textos/Haldane.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">primordial soup</a>” model — how life could have originated from <span data-note="Abiogenic means not produced by the activity of living organisms; abiogenesis is the process by which life could have evolved from non-living materials.">abiogenic</span> materials on an ancient Earth. Both scientists looked forward to that night’s lunar eclipse.</p>



<p>Over dinner, Haldane — a “confirmed Communist” and “radical alternativist,” according to Lederberg — “gloated” that it was also the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the October Revolution, the event that had precipitated the formation of the Soviet Union. As a thought experiment, the two scientists wondered: What if the Soviets leveraged the symbolic occasion to plant a “red star” — a nuclear bomb — on the moon? Their back-of-the-napkin calculation revealed that it would be visible from Earth.</p>



<p>Of course, there was no “red star” that evening, and the U.S. astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission, not Soviet cosmonauts, would be the first to land on the moon twelve years later, in 1969. But the conversation with Haldane about the possibility for off-Earth atomic destruction spurred Lederberg toward the study of “exobiology,” the search to detect and preserve life beyond Earth. As the U.S. and the Soviet Union’s space race accelerated during the Cold War, the National Academy of Sciences established the Space Science Board (SSB) to research outer space and to recommend policies to NASA. That group, which included Lederberg and other prominent scientists (among them a young Carl Sagan), worked to protect the moon and other extraterrestrial sites as scientific laboratories.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to possible NASA missions that would explore Mars and Venus for traces of life, a 1959 SSB report that Lederberg chaired transported Cold War fears of nuclear war on Earth to celestial bodies beyond. It warned that “the effect of introducing radioactivity on another planet where there may be entirely different levels of background radiation from those found on Earth could greatly influence any form of life found there.” Planetary concerns of atomic fallout migrated to unexplored sites beyond our planet.</p>



<p>In addition to nuclear radiation on other planets, the possibility of microbial contamination presented risks in the search for life beyond Earth. A spacecraft landing on Mars, for example, might bring terrestrial hitchhikers, risking a false detection of organic biochemistry that would muddle attempts to theorize the origin of life in the solar system and possibly the cosmos beyond. Throughout the late 1950s and the 60s, exobiologists’ reports urged sterilization protocols be taken so as to preserve possible “planetary biota” on Mars.</p>



<p>At the same time, exobiologists worried that possible Martian microbes might infect Earth; through incautious activity by either the U.S. or the Soviet Union, a “dramatic hazard would be the introduction of a new disease, imperiling human health,” as Lederberg wrote in 1960. This particular threat took center stage in Michael Crichton’s 1969 science fiction book (and subsequent film) “The Andromeda Strain,” in which a mysterious and fatal extraterrestrial microorganism appears in Arizona and threatens to end life on Earth. Merging apocalypses, the characters consider annihilating the infected laboratory with a nuclear bomb.</p>



<p>Civilian scientists’ goals to detect extraterrestrials were often <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/344962?seq=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">at odds</a> with those of the national agencies they answered to. While John F. Kennedy’s 1962 “<a href="https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">We choose to go to the moon</a>” speech mandated the priority of manned missions to outer space that would showcase national prestige, exobiologists advocated for international efforts to preserve (extra)terrestrial life forms. A 1961 SSB report suggested that the U.S. and the Soviet Union work together on sterilization protocols to “simplify the problem of protection against possible contamination of the planets and of the Earth.” The planetary struggle for political dominance, which threatened to plunge Earth into a nuclear apocalypse, was thus shaping extraplanetary pursuits.</p>



<p>As they considered Earth and extraterrestrial sites of possible life (Mars’s subsurface, Venus’s atmosphere and even, possibly, the moon’s dust) in tandem, exobiologists began to imagine interconnected, but distinct, planetary wholes. Linking Earth to planets beyond, two exobiologists wrote in a 1961 <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/12425/chapter/1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a>, “The planets of the solar system are part of a whole — in their origins, in their present states and in their futures.” Such exercises that forecasted other worlds soon came to intersect with growing concerns about the fragility of our own planet.</p>

<h5><strong>Interconnection</strong></h5>



<p>Amid the persistent threat of nuclear apocalypse that defined the Cold War era, exobiologists began to call for planetary protection protocols for both Earth and extraterrestrial sites — concerns that became increasingly aligned with a burgeoning consciousness about humans’ harmful activities on Earth. Rachel Carson’s 1962 book “Silent Spring” introduced the idea that synthetic chemicals, especially pesticides — which she <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/reviews/carson-obit.html?_r=2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argued</a> should be called “biocides” — were fundamentally altering life on Earth. The ensuing environmental movement of the 1960s and 70s culminated in the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and made “the environment” a widespread public concern, fortifying the concept that life systems were interconnected, malleable and fragile.</p>



<p>Stewart Brand’s “Whole Earth Catalog” often advocated for ecological issues and <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-origins-of-planetary-realism-and-whole-earth-thinking/" data-wpel-link="internal">featured</a> images of Earth from space on its early covers, from a mosaic made of satellite photos to Apollo 8’s “Earthrise.” Images of Earth from outer space cast it as a planetary …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><nav aria-label="breadcrumb"><ol><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer">The New Network Multiplexer </a></li></ol></nav><p>Since the first versions of Ditto, devices always made multiple connections to other peers. For example, two iOS devices will try to connect simultaneously over WiFi, Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We make multiple connections because each transport has different characteristics such as throughput and distance. For example, Bluetooth Low Energy works over long distances but has little bandwidth. AWDL has much more bandwidth but the devices need to be close together.</p>
<p>In the example below we see two iPhones syncing over AWDL and BLE. As one device gets further from the other, the AWDL connection will degrade and disconnect while the BLE connection sustains longer distances.</p>

<h2 id="pre-version-1.0.0">Pre-Version 1.0.0</h2>
<p>Before version 1.0.0, Ditto created a unique replication session for every transport. This is the software component which tracks queries and data changes and ensures that every Ditto device stays in sync. These separate replication pathways can appear or disappear as connections come and go, without disrupting sibling sessions.</p>
<p>When there is new data to sync, a session packs that data into an update file. With multiple concurrent sessions, all of them would then race against each other to transmit that update file as quickly as possible, regardless of duplication between transports. Transactional locking on the internal database made sure that only one session at a time could modify the update file, which prevented race conditions. Since any session is able to maintain the update file, any individual session can fail and replication will always continue, providing a high level of reliability.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ditto.live/assets/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer/old-way.svg" alt="old-way-sessions"></p>
<p>In this benchmark we see the consequences of each session sending data eagerly over every transport. In an attempt to send a document with about 2 megabytes of data, all five connected modes of transport aggressively sent data as fast as they could. We can see that the highly efficient AWDL transports could send all bytes first, and the remote peer quickly notified the slower connections that they could stop. However, the slower transports had already sent duplicate bytes. In the end, the peer had sent 5.4 megabytes even though the document size was about 2 megabytes. This was 2.6 times larger than the initial payload. Furthermore, this fully occupied the BLE radio, consuming bandwidth that could have been better used by a Bluetooth-only peer.</p>
<div>

    <thead>
      <tr>

        <td>5390896</td>
        <td>134</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<p>In version 1.0.0, we’ve introduced a completely new system for creating sync sessions between peers we call the multiplexer. Our first order of business was to reduce the duplication of sessions to the same peer over multiple transport types. We’ve introduced the concept of a virtual connection between two peers. No matter how many transport connections are active, there will only be one virtual connection and only one session. Now incoming data is buffered and intermediated from the transport layer to a single virtual connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ditto.live/assets/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer/new-way.svg" alt="new-way-multiplexer"></p>
<p>This new architecture allows each virtual connection to intelligently send data over multiple physical transports with fine-grained control. For example, the multiplexer can switch active transports on the fly without unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The multiplexer on the left device deemed that TCP (WiFi) was the best transport to start sending data.</li>
<li>Suddenly, the infastructure WiFi goes out, and the multiplexer switches to AWDL.</li>
<li>As the device moves away from its peer, AWDL is lost and the multiplexer switches to BLE.</li>
<li>The devices move closer together and the multiplexer finishes the rest of the transmission over AWDL.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the total bytes sent is equal to the size of the update file.</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Transport</th>
        <th>Bytes Sent</th>

        <td>246</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

</div>

<p>The introduction of the multiplexer is a gigantic step forward for Ditto's networking capabilities. Today, it focuses on using one transport at a time but this new foundation allows us to build even more powerful, dynamic and flexible replication techniques such as using multiple transports at a time over unreliable connections, streaming use cases, and decentralized data sync techniques reminiscent of BitTorrent.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software Development Kits (SDK) and Application Programming Interface (API) are critical components of your app’s development. However, these two terms sometimes overlap, often leading to confusion.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Knowing their differences and how you can take advantage of them can significantly help you improve your application. This piece tackles their distinct features and outlines how you can utilize them to supercharge your app.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is an API?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>By definition, APIs are sets of instructions and protocols used to integrate specific functionalities into an application. An API can help connect your apps or projects to external services, enabling seamless data transfer and adding a new feature altogether.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at this example from software company <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api">Mulesoft</a> explaining the function of an API:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order. What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.</em><br></blockquote><p>With an API, developers don’t have to worry about creating lots of custom code to enable functionalities, as various APIs exist to fulfill a specific function. As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Youtube&amp;utm_content=000023UA&amp;utm_term=10010608&amp;utm_id=YTDescription-101-API-vs-SDK-LH-API-Guide&amp;cm_mmc=OSocial_Youtube-_-Cloud+and+Data+Platform_SFT+Cloud+Platform+Digital-_-WW_WW-_-YTDescription-101-API-vs-SDK-LH-API-Guide&amp;cm_mmca1=000023UA&amp;cm_mmca2=10010608">IBM</a> mentioned, APIs allow companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality for third-party developers to use. So if you have a food delivery app and want to verify your user’s number, provide the location, and enable payment without leaving the platform, there’s an available phone, maps, and payment API to perform these actions.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is an SDK?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>On the other hand, SDKs are a set of tools used to develop applications for a specific platform. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-SDK">Red Hat</a> mentioned that a typical SDK contains a compiler, debugger, as well as APIs, and any of the following:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Documentation</li><li>Libraries</li><li>Editors</li><li>Runtime/development environments</li><li>Testing/analysis tools</li><li>Drivers</li><li>Network protocols<br></li></ul><p>Let’s take the restaurant scenario again. For example, you are a chef. When you’re cooking a dish, you will need ingredients for your recipe; you need the kitchen utensils so you can cook, you need a copy of a recipe to put the meal together, and so on. In the same way, SDK provides all the things you need to create your intended application.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SDKs are crucial when developing an app for a specific platform. For instance, Apple provides iOS SDKs to developers so they can create applications specifically for iOS. An SDK should add value to a developer. Hence it should be easy to use, provides a thorough explanation of the code used, and adds functionality to an existing app.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Things to remember&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Now that we defined both, let us recap:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>APIs facilitates the communication and integration of software</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>SDK provides the foundation to build an application specifically for a platform</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>SDKs contain APIs; APIs don’t contain SDKs<br></li></ul><p>API, as a part of an SDK, is lightweight and specialized based on the function intended. Meanwhile, SDKs have a collection of utilities to create a new application or add new functionalities.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>API and SDK can elevate your app&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Now that we know the differences, how can you take advantage of both to improve your app?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Utilizing SDKs with the APIs that meet your needs can significantly enhance your application’s functionality. According to <a href="https://marketfinder.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en/guide/improve-ux-ui-of-app/#overview">Google</a>, mobile users spend nine out of ten minutes using only their top five favorite apps. So how can your app be one of their top five?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>SDKs can enable powerful in-app features with the corresponding APIs that will substantially affect your app’s user experience. With so many apps out there, you would want yours to stand out in the app market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And of course, you just don’t want users to download your app; you would like them to keep and share it with their peers, creating a loyal fanbase for your application.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you are a brand and you aim to engage and retain your users, adding <a href="https://www.amity.co/blog/remain-competitive-by-adding-social-features-to-your-app">social features with an SDK </a>to your app can help raise user engagement through <a href="https://www.amity.co/blog/building-your-in-app-community-why-it-matters">in-app groups.</a> Meanwhile, integrating chat SDK into your application can facilitate 1-on-1 conversations or group interactions, allowing you to host online communities.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.amity.co/products/amity-video">Video SDKs</a> can help you integrate in-app live streaming and stories to your product if you have an entertainment application.&nbsp; So whether it’s a sports event or a concert broadcasted in your app, this solution can help bring throngs of fans to use your application. On the other hand, if your SDK has a <a href="https://www.amity.co/products/amity-bots">chatbot</a> API that can collect user data, you can use the information you have to create a more personalized user experience, push tailored notifications, and deliver the right content to your users.<br></p><p>In conclusion, API and SDK, regardless of their differences, can both be beneficial for your application. Using SDK with the right APIs can create numerous possibilities to improve your application. Now is the time to find the best SDKs to enhance your in-app user experience, engagement, and retention.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>I made a control board for the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboard that converts it to wired USB, and now my favorite keyboard is even better.</p>

</figure>

<p>The QMK config is available at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware">@chadaustin/qmk_firmware</a> (<a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/sculpt">keyboards/handwired/sculpt/</a>), and the PCB design files at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb">@chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb</a>.</p>

<p>I’m planning on making at least one more, so if you’d like one, maybe I can help.</p>

<p>It’s a huge improvement. Latency is reduced by about 13 milliseconds, and with full control over the microcontroller’s firmware, you can customize keymaps and layers, and actually use the keyboard’s built-in LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Feel free to stop reading here — I am going to tell the sequence of events that led to this project. Besides some exposure to basic voltage and resistance circuits in college, I have very little electronics background. But, in a short time, I went from only barely knowing what a capacitor was to having a working PCB manufactured and assembled, and maybe this will inspire someone else to give it a try.</p>

<p>Since developing RSI in college, I’ve exclusively used Microsoft’s ergonomic keyboards. And when I first tried the Sculpt, I instantly knew it was the best yet. The soft actuation, short key travel, and rigid frame are perfect for my hands. And because the number pad is a separate device, the distance to my mouse is shortened.</p>

<p>My brother went out and bought one too. Not much later, he gave it to me, saying the latency was inconsistent and high, and it was unacceptable for gaming. I thought he was being uniquely sensitive, since I had no problem in either Linux, Windows 7, or macOS. But then I updated to Windows 10 and saw exactly what he meant.</p>

<p>It was like the keyboard would go to sleep if a key wasn’t pressed for a few seconds, and the first keypress after a wake would be delayed or, worse, dropped.</p>

<p>And heaven forbid I use my USB 3 hub, whose EMI would disrupt the 2.4 GHz signal, and <em>every other</em> keypress would be unreliable. I’d gone as far as mounting the wireless transceiver directly under my keyboard, on the underside of my desk, and keys were still dropped.</p>

<p>So, best keyboard ever. But wireless sucks. (But mostly in Windows 10? No idea about that.)</p>

<h2 id="over-the-hump">Over the Hump</h2>

<p>What started this whole thing is that the <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/eden/#edenfs">EdenFS</a> team was a bunch of keyboard enthusiasts. During the pandemic, as we’re all at home burning out and missing each other, we were trying to think of some virtual team offsites. Wez offered to walk everyone through building a <a href="https://www.1upkeyboards.com/instructions-downloads/sweet-16-instructions/">Sweet 16 Macro Pad</a>.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg" alt="Assembled Sweet 16 underside"></a>
<figcaption>Assembled Sweet 16 underside. This is take two, after resoldering and cleaning the whole thing. Take one was a bit of a mess.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, okay, a keyboard is a matrix, with some diodes used to disambiguate the signalling, and a microcontroller that rapidly polls the matrix and reports events over USB…</p>

<p>So maybe I could fix the Sculpt! I bought a transceiver-less Sculpt off eBay for cheap and <a href="http://emmanuelcontreras.com/how-to/how-to-disassemble-microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-and-make-it-wired/">popped it open (thanks Emmanuel Contreras!)</a>, thinking maybe its controller could be flashed with new firmware that speaks USB. The Sculpt uses a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF24LE1_PS_v1.6.pdf">Nordic Semiconductor nRF24LE1</a>, but I was nowhere near capable of making use of that information at the time, though it did point me to Samy Kamkar’s horrifying guide on <a href="https://samy.pl/keysweeper/">surreptitiously sniffing keystrokes from nearby (older) Microsoft wireless keyboards</a>.</p>

<p>I almost gave up here, but Per Vognsen <a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1322422385174220800">suggested I scan the matrix myself</a> and it turns out Michael Fincham had already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhkgnp/modification_photos_qmk_wired_microsoft_sculpt/">mapped out the matrix and soldered a Teensy 2.0++ board onto the Sculpt’s test pads</a>, showing this was doable!</p>

<p>So I ordered my own microcontroller to try the same thing.</p>

<p>First, I bought an Arduino Pro Micro, like the Sweet 16 uses. Oh hey, 18 GPIO pins isn’t enough to drive the Sculpt’s 26-pin matrix. I looked at using an I2C GPIO expander, but it felt like taking on too much.</p>

</figure>

<p>More pins? QMK’s Proton C has more pins! So I carefully soldered onto the test pads as Michael had shown was possible… and it worked!</p>

</figure>

<p>Getting those wires to stick to the pads without shorting was tricky. (I hadn’t yet discovered how magical flux is.)</p>

<p>The keyboard worked, but I couldn’t fit the board, its wires, and the new microcontroller into the case, and I wasn’t <em>really</em> happy leaving it in this state, even if I could pack it in somehow.</p>

<p>I thought, all I <em>really</em> need is the ribbon cable connector, so I ordered a 30 pin, 1.0 mm pitch ribbon breakout and the pricier (but tons of pins!) <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy 2.0++</a>. Looking back, it’s cute that I was trying to save $10 on the microcontroller… You just have to get used to spending money on whatever saves you time.</p>

<figcaption>Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, it was almost as annoying to solder, and still didn’t fit. So much for saving money on microcontrollers.</p>

<p>I thought about giving up. Is it really that bad that my keys don’t always register in games? Can I just tolerate some flakiness and latency?</p>

<p>But Jon Watte offered to spend an entire day showing me how to use KiCad, design circuits, layout PCBs, select components on Digi-Key, scan datasheets for the important information, and how to work with a PCB manufacturing house. Of course you never turn down opportunities like that.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---schematic">Designing the Final Board - Schematic</h2>

<p>Assuming, like me, you’ve never done this, I’ll summarize the steps.</p>

<p>First you sketch out the circuit schematic.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png" alt="Schematic"></a>
<figcaption>Schematic in KiCad. Most of this was informed by the datasheet and Atmel's design guides.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jon showed me several tricks in KiCad, like global labels, and starting with some standard resistor and capacitor values, but it’s very important that you go through the datasheets, because details can matter a ton.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted the main processor to be the AT90USB1286 controller, and fortunately KiCad already had a symbol for it. Atmel has a comprehensive and accessible data sheet, which showed me I needed some 22 Ω resistors on the USB data lines, which of the ISP programmer lines needed resistors (and appropriate values), and that I needed to either pull HWB low, or provide a physical switch that pulls it low, in order to allow rebooting the device into USB firmware update mode.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of things that are implicitly known to electrical engineers but that were new to me. You want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ground plane under the data lines and most of the microcontroller if possible.</li>
  <li>an electrolytic or tantalum bypass capacitor on the main 5V power from USB.</li>
  <li>ceramic filter capacitors on each power pin.</li>
  <li>appropriate values for the resonance capacitors on your crystal.</li>
  <li>electrostatic discharge protection! Turns out transients are common and it’s easy to fry a chip just by plugging it in.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then when you get into concerns like EMI and high-frequency signal integrity, the rabbit hole goes deep.</p>

<p>I kept having to tell myself “it’s just a keyboard”, but it also helped that there are a great number of high-quality resources on these topics just a click away. I spent lots of time on <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/">EEVBlog</a>.</p>

<p>Before finishing the circuit design, Jon had me do a couple smart things. In case the factory-supplied USB bootloader didn’t work out, he suggested I add the footprint (but not a connector!) for an ISP programmer and a debug LED to prove code would work at all.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---physical-layout">Designing the Final Board - Physical Layout</h2>

<p>After arranging the schematic and ensuring it passed the electrical rules check, it was time to pick specific components. That is, the reference to a 220 Ω resistor is replaced with the Panasonic ERJ-3EKF2200V, 0603 surface mount.</p>

<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind. For common components, like resistors and ceramic capacitors, there is a huge amount of choice. For example, I see over 1400 surface-mount 220 Ω resistors on digikey. I tried to just stick with one high-quality brand like Panasonic or Samsung for all of that stuff.</p>

<p>The important thing is the physical form factor, which determines the footprint on the board. Once you pick a part, it has a size, and you need to tell KiCad which physical footprint should be assigned to that component. I used 0603 resistors, so I assigned each resistor in the schematic the “Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric” footprint.</p>

<p>Same for everything else. Jon showed me how to draw my own footprints, but to avoid complexity, I was able to find appropriate footprints in KiCad’s standard libraries for every component I needed.</p>

<p>When you import the schematic into Pcbnew, it’s time to figure out where things go. Where are the edges of the board? Make careful measurements here. Where do the mounting holes go? Where do you want 
the microcontroller? Where do you want the USB port?</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Measuring dimensions and mounting holes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also, you have to pick through-hole sizes and trace widths. Jon had me use .250 mm for the narrow traces and .500 mm for the wider ones, presumably from experience. I used the narrow traces for signalling and wide traces for power, though I’ve since heard it’s a good idea to use narrow traces between filter capacitors and VBUS.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/pcb-layout.svg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/pcb-layout.svg" alt="Schematic"></a>
<figcaption>PCB layout in KiCad</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course, there’s some iteration between the schematic and the PCB. After physically placing the ribbon cable connector and MCU, the traces all crossed over each other, so I had to reassign all the pins so it made sense physically.</p>

<p>There are also physical constraints about how USB data lines are run, and how the electrostatic protection chip wants to be placed for the most protection.</p>

<p>So, as simple as this board is, I spent a fair amount of time getting all of that right.</p>

<p>I found myself getting lost in the abstractness of holes and traces and footprints, so it was helpful to ground myself by occasionally loading the PCB in KiCad’s 3D viewer.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we share empirical measurements from our experiments in using Postgres to index and search over 10,000 top GitHub repositories using <code>pg_trgm</code> on only a Macbook.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/postgres-trigram-search-learnings">“Postgres Trigram search learnings”</a>, in which we shared several learnings and beliefs about trying to use Postgres Trigram indexes as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”).</p>

<p>We share our results, as well as <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements">the exact steps we performed, scripts, and lists of the top 20,000 repositories by stars/language on GitHub</a> so you can reproduce the results yourself should you desire.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p><strong>This article is extensive and more akin to a research paper than a blog post.</strong> If you’re interested in our conclusions, see <a href="#conclusions">conclusions</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We wanted to get empirical measurements for how suitable Postgres is in providing regexp search over documents, e.g. as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”). In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many repositories can we index on just a 2019 Macbook Pro?</li>
  <li>How fast are different regexp searches over the corpus?</li>
  <li>What Postgres 13 configuration gives best results?</li>
  <li>What other operational effects need consideration if seriously attempting to use Postgres as the backend for a regexp search engine?</li>
  <li>What is the best database schema to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>We ran all tests on a 2019 Macbook Pro with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9</li>
  <li>16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4</li>
</ul>

<p>During test execution, few other Mac applications were in use such that effectively all CPU/memory was available to Postgres.</p>

<h2 id="corpus">Corpus</h2>

<p>We scraped <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/tree/main/top_repos">lists of the top 1,000 repositories from the GitHub search API</a> ranked by stars for each of the following languages (~20.5k repositories in total):</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++, C#, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, MatLab, ObjC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Shell, Solidity, Swift, TypeScript, VB .NET, and Zig.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloning all ~20.5k repositories in parallel took ~14 hours with a fast ~100 Mbps connection to GitHub’s servers.</p>

<h3 id="dataset-reduction">Dataset reduction</h3>

<p>We found the amount of disk space required by <code>git clone --depth 1</code> on these repositories to be a sizable ~412G for just 12,148 repositories - and so we put in place several processes for further reduce the dataset size by about 66%:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removing <code>.git</code> directories resulted in a 30% reduction (412G -&gt; 290G, for 12,148 repositories)</li>
  <li>Removing files &gt; 1 MiB resulted in another 51% reduction (290G -&gt; 142G, for 12,148 repositories - note GitHub does not index files &gt; 384 KiB in their search engine)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database-insertion">Database insertion</h2>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/cmd/corpusindex/main.go">concurrently inserted</a> the entire corpus into Postgres, with the following DB schema:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>pg_trgm</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>files</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>bigserial</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>contents</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>filepath</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In total, this took around ~8 hours to complete and Postgres’s entire on-disk utilization was 101G.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-trigram-index">Creating the Trigram index</h2>

<p>We tried three separate times to index the dataset using the following GIN Trigram index:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS files_contents_trgm_idx ON files USING GIN (contents gin_trgm_ops);
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In the first attempt, we hit an OOM after 11 hours and 34 minutes.</strong> This was due to a rapid spike in memory usage at the very end of indexing. We used a <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements#configuration-attempt-1-indexing-failure-oom">fairly aggressive</a> Postgres configuration with a very large max WAL size, so it was not entirely unexpected.</li>
  <li><strong>In the second attempt, we ran out of SSD disk space after ~27 hours</strong>. Notable is that the disk space largely grew towards the end of indexing, similar to when we faced an OOM - it was not a gradual increase over time. For this attempt, we used the excellent <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/#/">pgtune</a> tool to reduce our first Postgres configuration as follows:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>shared_buffers = 4GB → 2560MB
effective_cache_size = 12GB → 7680MB
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB → 1280MB
default_statistics_target = 100 → 500
work_mem = 5242kB → 16MB
min_wal_size = 50GB → 4GB
max_wal_size = 4GB → 16GB
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 8 → 4
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8 → 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In our third and final attempt, we cut the dataset in half and indexing succeeded after 22 hours.</strong> In specific, we deleted half of the files in the database (from 19,441,820 files / 178GiB of data to 9,720,910 files / 82 GiB of data.) The Postgres configuration used was the same as in attempt 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-memory-usage">Indexing performance: Memory usage</h2>

<p>In our first attempt, we see the reported <code>docker stats</code> memory usage of the container grow up to 12 GiB (chart shows MiB of memory used over time):</p>

<p><img width="981" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313722-56bbac80-6a50-11eb-94c7-8e13ea095053.png"></p>

<p>In our second and third attempts, we see far less memory usage (~1.6 GiB consistently):</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314104-350ef500-6a51-11eb-909f-2f1b524d29b2.png"></p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315387-ce3f0b00-6a53-11eb-886c-410f000f73bd.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-cpu-usage">Indexing performance: CPU usage</h2>

<p>Postgres’ Trigram indexing appears to be mostly single-threaded (at least when indexing <em>a single table</em>, we test multiple tables later.)</p>

<p>In our first attempt, CPU usage for the container did not rise above 156% (one and a half virtual CPU cores):</p>

<p><img width="982" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313915-cc277d00-6a50-11eb-9282-62159a127966.png"></p>

<p>Our second attempt was around 150-200% CPU usage on average:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314168-507a0000-6a51-11eb-8a18-ec18752f7f16.png"></p>

<p>Our third attempt similarly saw an average of 150-200%, but with a brief spike towards the end to ~350% CPU:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315239-8324f800-6a53-11eb-9a5b-fcc61d1a7b59.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-io">Indexing performance: Disk IO</h2>

<p>Disk reads/writes during indexing averaged about ~250 MB/s for reads (blue) and writes (red). Native in-software tests show the same Macbook able to achieve read/write speeds of ~860 MB/s with &lt;5% affect on CPU utilization.</p>

<p><small>Addition made Feb 20, 2021:</small> We ran tests using native Postgres as well (instead of in Docker with a bind mount) and found better indexing and query performance, more on this below.</p>

<p><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106507903-ec6f9e80-6488-11eb-88a8-78e5b7aacfd6.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-space">Indexing performance: Disk space</h2>

<p>The database contains 9,720,910 files totalling 82.07 GiB:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# select count(filepath) from files;
  count  
---------
 9720910
(1 row)

postgres=# select SUM(octet_length(contents)) from files;
     sum     
-------------
 88123563320
(1 row)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Before indexing</strong>, we find that all of Postgres is consuming 54G:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 54G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After <code>CREATE INDEX</code>, Postgres uses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 73G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, the index size for 82 GiB of text is 19 GiB (or 23% of the data size.)</p>

<h2 id="database-startup-times">Database startup times</h2>

<p>From an operational standpoint, it is worth noting that if Postgres is starting clean (i.e. previous shutdown was graceful) then startup time is almost instantaneous: it begins accepting connections immediately and loads the index as needed.</p>

<p>However, if Postgres experienced a non-graceful termination during e.g. startup, it can take a hefty ~10 minutes with this dataset to start as it goes through an automated recovery process.</p>

<h2 id="queries-executed">Queries executed</h2>

<p>In total, we executed 19,936 search queries against the index. We chose queries which we expect give reasonably varying amounts of coverage over the trigram index (that is, queries whose trigrams are more or less likely to occur in many files):</p>

<h2 id="query-performance-vs-planning-time">Query performance vs. planning time</h2>

<p>The following scatter plot shows how 79% of queries executed in under 3s (Y axis, in ms), while Postgres’s query planner had planned them for execution in under 100-250ms generally (X axis, in ms):</p>

<p><img width="1252" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848471-ef379100-6db0-11eb-8396-4d156a179aae.png"></p>

<p>If we expand the view to include all queries, we start to get a picture of just how outlier these 21% of queries are (note that the small block of dots in the bottom left represents the same diagram shown above):</p>

<p><img width="1250" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848517-3cb3fe00-6db1-11eb-9652-e65d7d88fe36.png"></p>

<h2 id="query-time-vs-cpu--memory-usage">Query time vs. CPU &amp; Memory usage</h2>

<p>The following image shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(top) Query time in milliseconds</li>
  <li>(middle) CPU usage percentage (e.g. 801% refers to 8 out of 16 virtual CPU cores being consumed)</li>
  <li>(bottom) Memory usage in MiB.</li>
</ul>

<p><img width="1255" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848716-efd12700-6db2-11eb-8e8b-a8141a6bdb0b.png"></p>

<p>Notable insights from this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The large increase in resource usage towards the end is when we began executing queries with no <code>LIMIT</code>.</li>
  <li>CPU usage does not exceed 138%, until the spike at the end.</li>
  <li>Memory usage does not exceed 42 MiB, until the spike at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>We suspect <code>pg_trgm</code> is single-threaded within the scope of a single table, but with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ddl-partitioning.html">table data partitioning</a> (or splitting data into multiple tables with subsets of the data), we suspect better parallelism could be achieved.</p>

<h2 id="investigating-slow-queries">Investigating slow queries</h2>

<p>If we plot the number of index rechecks (X axis) vs. execution time (Y axis), we can clearly see one of the most significant aspects of slow queries is that they have many more index rechecks:</p>

<p><img width="1036" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107849660-fc0cb280-6db9-11eb-9c10-cb7e74366ab7.png"></p>

<p>And if we look at <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/query_logs/query-run-3.log#L3-L24">the <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> output for one of these queries</a> we can also confirm <code>Parallel Bitmap Heap Scan</code> is slow due to <code>Rows Removed by Index Recheck</code>.</p>

<h2 id="table-splitting">Table splitting</h2>

<p>Splitting up the search index into multiple smaller tables seems like an obvious approach to getting <code>pg_trgm</code> to use multiple CPU cores. We tried this by taking the same exact data set and splitting it into 200 tables, and found …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <p>A binary counter is an electronic component that records the number of times it has received a pulse. It is called <em>binary</em> because it stores the number in its binary representation. Counters are absolutely ubiquitous in electronics and can be used to make circuits ranging from memory chips to FM radio decoders.</p>

<p>Since counters are so useful, I thought it would be fun to implement one using only basic logic gates like NAND and OR. As a practical application, I hooked up a 1-bit counter to a clock and a pair of LEDs to create a random bit generator:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/random_breadboard.jpeg" alt="Random Generator"></p>

<p>The output of the counter is connected to two LEDs. One of them lights up when the counter is in the 0 state and the other lights up in the 1 state. When the button is pressed down, the clock starts sending out around 100 pulses per second causing the counter to oscillate between 0 and 1. When the button is released the timer stops and the the counter remains in its most recent state as indicated by the corresponding LED. The state is maintained until the next time the button is pressed.</p>

<p>Since the oscillations are very fast relative to human reflexes, the LED that remains lit after each button release appears to be chosen randomly with each LED appearing with equal probability. In other words, one can think of this circuit as simulating a coin flip where one of the LEDs represents heads and the other tails. At the end of the post I will provide some evidence that two outcomes are indeed equally likely.</p>

<p>The primary goal of this post is to explain how to make a 1 bit counter out of basic logic gates. After that weâ€™ll get into the details of the complete random bit generator circuit shown above. Weâ€™ll conclude by showing how multiple 1 bit counters can easily be chained together to produce larger counters such as the useful 8 bit counter.</p>


<p>Here is a high level schematic of the one bit binary counter we want to build:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/one_bit_counter.png" alt="One Bit Counter"></p>

<p>We now turn to the design requirements.</p>

<p>The counter has a single input which is labelled â€œClockâ€� and two outputs labelled $Q$ and $\overline{Q}$. The input and output wires can either have a â€œhighâ€� voltage or a â€œlowâ€� voltage. In our case, we will be using a 5 volt power supply so a â€œhighâ€� wire will be close to 5 volts and a â€œlowâ€� wire will be close to 0 volts.</p>

<p>The overline on the bottom output represents the fact that its state is always opposite to $Q$. I.e, if $Q$ is high then $\overline{Q}$ is low and vice versa. It may seem redundant to include both $Q$ and $\overline{Q}$ but later we will see why it is useful. We summarize the state of the counter by writing $Q=1$ if $Q$ is high and $Q=0$ if $Q$ is low.</p>

<p>As long as the clock input is low the output state should remain fixed. But each time the the clock receives a pulse (explained below) the values of the outputs should flip.</p>

<p>In more detail, a â€œpulseâ€� means that the clock input rises from low to high, and then quickly falls back to low. Since the output should only change one time per pulse, we would like the outputs to flip whenever the clock input <em>rises</em> from low to high. This special behavior is indicated by the triangle next to the clock input.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why we need this fancy pulse behavior. Why canâ€™t we simply demand that the outputs flip whenever the input is high? The issue with that design is that every pulse has some non-zero duration. So even a short pulse would cause the outputs to start rapidly flipping back and forth from the moment the clock input went high until the end of the pulse when it went low again. This would make the final state undefined!</p>

<p>In contrast, the input voltage rises from low to high exactly once per pulse so our design guarantees that the outputs will flip exactly once whenever the input receives a pulse.</p>

<p>Now that weâ€™ve specified the counterâ€™s behavior we turn to the implementation.</p>

<p>There are two main implementation challenges. First, how does the counter maintain its state between pulses? Second of all, how is it possible to detect the low to high transition exactly once per pulse?</p>

<p>In the next section we focus on the first issue by considering a simpler type of component that has two separate â€œonâ€� and â€œoffâ€� inputs rather than the complex clock input. We will then solve the pulse problem by chaining two of these simpler components to each other!</p>

<h2 id="the-sr-flip-flop">The SR Flip-flop</h2>
<p>In this section weâ€™ll build a component called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#Simple_set-reset_latches">Set Reset Flip-flop</a> or <em>SR Flip-flop</em> for short.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram of the SR flip-flop:
<img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/sr_flipflop.png" alt="SR Flip-flop"></p>

<p>This flip-flop has two inputs: $S$ (â€œsetâ€�) and $R$ (â€œresetâ€�) and two outputs: $Q$ and $\overline{Q}$. As before, $\overline{Q}$ always has the opposite value of $Q$. So if $Q$ is high then $\overline{Q}$ is low and vice versa.</p>

<p>In its default state, both inputs $S$ and $R$ are high and the output $Q$ is low. If $S$ is pulled low (i.e $S=0$) this <em>sets</em> the gate and causes the output $Q$ to be high (and therefore $\overline{Q}$ to be low). The output will stay in this state even when $S$ goes high again. On the other hand, pulling $R$ low <em>resets</em> the gate which means that $Q$ will go low. As before, $Q$ will remain low even when $R$ goes back to being high.</p>

<p>In summary, we can flip between the two possible output states by lowering either $S$ or $R$. Furthermore, the SR flip-flop maintains its state until the next set or reset operation.</p>

<p>It turns out that it is possible to build an SR latch out of just two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate">NAND gates</a> via an ingenious mechanism called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#SR_NAND_latch">NAND latch</a> as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/nand_latch_circuit.png" alt="NAND Latch"></p>

<p>We are using the convention that an â€œXâ€� intersection of wires means that the wires do not touch but rather cross over each other.</p>

<p>How does this circuit work? Lets see what happens if we start in the defaults state ($S=R=\overline{Q}=1$, $Q=0$) and perform a <em>set</em> operation:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/nand_latch_states.png" alt="NAND Latch"></p>

<p>In the initial state the input to the top NAND is $(1, 1)$ and so its output is $Q=0$. The input to the bottom NAND is $(0, 1)$ so its output is $\overline{Q}=1$. Since everything is consistent, the gates will stay in this configuration until we change one of the the inputs.</p>

<p>Now lets perform a â€œsetâ€� operation by pulling down $S$ to a low state to get $S=0$. Since one of the inputs to the top NAND is $0$, its output will be $Q=1$ regardless of the other input. This means that the input to the bottom NAND is $(1, 1)$ causing its output to be $\overline{Q}=0$.</p>

<p>Finally, lets see what happens if we release $S$ and let it go back to the default high state $S=1$. The input to the top NAND is now $(1, 0)$ which means that its output is still $Q=1$. Therefore the output to the bottom NAND is still $(1, 1)$ causing its output to stay at $\overline{Q}=0$.</p>

<p>In summary, we can see that one cycle of $S=0 \Rightarrow S=1$ <em>sets</em> the output to $Q=1,\,\overline{Q}=0$. A similar analysis shows that a cycle of $R=0 \Rightarrow R=1$ <em>resets</em> the output to $Q=0,\,\overline{Q}=1$.</p>

<h2 id="a-1-bit-counter-implementation">A 1-Bit Counter Implementation</h2>
<p>We now return to the problem of building a one bit counter. The SR flip-flop from the last section gets us pretty close: It has the outputs $Q$ and $\overline{Q}$ and allows us to toggle between them by pulling down $S$ or $R$. To turn this into a counter we need to replace the set/reset inputs with a single <em>clock</em> input.</p>

<p>The general logic should be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the clock is low then then the SR inputs should be in their default state of $S=R=1$. This will result in $Q$ maintaining its current state.</li>
  <li>If the clock is high and $Q=1$, <em>reset</em> the SR flip-flop by setting $R=0$. This will result in $Q=0$.</li>
  <li>If the clock is high and $Q=0$, <em>set</em> the SR flip-flop by setting $S=0$. This will result in $Q=1$.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can implement this logic by wiring up an SR flip-flop with two NAND gates like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/one_bit_circuit_simple.png" alt="One Bit Counter Circuit"></p>

<p>As before, wires that meet in an X intersection do not touch each other. Weâ€™ve connected the $Q$ output to the bottom NAND and the $\overline{Q}$ output to the top NAND.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s verify that this circuit follows the logic outlined above. Indeed, if $\mathrm{Clock}=0$ then both of the NANDs will have a $0$ input and so their outputs will always both be $1$. This means that the two inputs to the SR flip-flop will be in their default $1$ state as desired.</p>

<p>What happens when the clock goes high ($\mathrm{Clock}=1$)? Suppose that $Q=1,\,\overline{Q}=0$. Then the inputs to the top NAND will be $(\overline{Q}=0, \mathrm{Clock}=1)$ and so its output will be $1$. On the other hand, the inputs to the bottom NAND will be $(\mathrm{Clock}=1, Q=1)$ so its output will be $0$. Together this means that the input to the SR flip-flop will be $S=1$, $R=0$ which by definition will <em>reset</em> the flip-flop to $Q=0,\,\overline{Q}=1$.</p>

<p>If the clock goes high again it is not hard to see that the SR inputs will now be $(S=0,\,R=1)$ causing it to <em>set</em> the output back to $Q=0,\,\overline{Q}=1$.</p>

<p>The only problem with this setup is that the outputs will keep flipping as long as the clock is high! Since each clock pulse has some non-zero duration, this version of the counter will flip many times per pulse rather than just once.</p>

<p>The solution is to use <em>two</em> SR flip-flops. One will record the current output and the other will record the output for the next pulse. The trick is that the â€œcurrentâ€� flip-flop is activated when the clock goes high as above, but the â€œnextâ€� flip-flop will be activated when the clock goes low. The effect is that the counter is only updated after a complete cycle $\mathrm{Clock}=0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{Clock}=1$, preventing the oscillations in our first version.</p>

<p>Here is an implementation of this idea:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/binary_counter/one_bit_circuit.png" alt="One Bit Counter Circuit"></p>

<p>When the clock is <em>low</em> it is easy to see that $S_{cur}=R_{cur}=1$ meaning that the â€œcurrentâ€� flip-flop will not be updated. In contrast, when the clock is <em>high</em> $S_{next}=R_{next}=1$ and so the â€œnextâ€� clock will not be updated. It is not hard to verify that with this version the outputs $Q,\,\overline{Q}$ flip exactly once when the clock receives a pulse.</p>

<p>This is the first post in this blog, it was published on February 19, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>The year of 2020 will be remembered for the pandemic, the BLM movement, and the U.S. elections among other billion of things around the globe. It is funny I even mention the third one considering how little I give a damn about U.S. politics, yet this whole story begins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a> deplatforming that happened about a month ago. Let me remind you: Apple, Google, Amazon, and a few other companies terminated their service to the free speech social network for insufficient moderation effectively destroying the platform in a matter of just a couple of days. What the fuck?</p>

<p>OK, let me be clear with my position: I believe every private company has a right to refuse service to anyone, whether an individual or a business, but I also have my own right to despise them for exercising that. What they did was probably legal, but screw them anyway, they failed us. Regardless what these psychopathic corporations like to tell the public, they are only concerned with maximizing shareholder value, and if there is anything  even remotely resembling an image liability (through pressure by political radicals, cancel culture SJWs, you name it), they will not think twice. What disgusts me the most here is neither greed nor hypocrisy but their unwillingness to grow a pair of balls and stand up for freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You see, freedom of speech and expression must be absolute. You cannot have censorship-resistance with exceptions; otherwise, these exceptions could be used to remove or block anything unwanted, not only offensive. This way, the Chinese cannot access Wikipedia because of what originally started as a counter-terrorism measure, and the Russians cannot access LinkedIn because of what originally started as a children protection measure. We cannot deprive humanity of their freedom just because some small fraction of users might, unfortunately, use that freedom to spread offensive content. In the same way, you do not ban electricity because people get electrocuted.</p>

<p>Let us now switch from corporates to governments. Ooh, wee! Do not even get me started on that. And I am not even talking about cases like Google happily not letting people disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch">SafeSearch</a> in Indonesia because its government knows best, that is just the tip of the iceberg. I am talking about political censorship which includes silencing people with torture, gulags, and bullets. Here is the world map of the freedom of the press status:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/press-freedom.png" alt="2020 Press Freedom Index"></p>

<p>Just look at this mess. Blue tones mean OK-ish, others not so much. This map is <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NordNordWest">NordNordWest</a>’s work based on the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">2020 Press Freedom Index</a> and is distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/legalcode">CC BY-SA 3.0 de</a>. Keep in mind population densities, e.g. there are about 90 times more people per unit area living in Vietnam than Australia. I am actually surprised the U.S. did so well in 2020 considering how badly they wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Mr. Assange</a> to be extradited and executed.</p>

<p>What would you answer your children if they asked you how in the world North Korea still exists in its current form with 25 million Koreans suffering for over 70 years and no one is doing anything about that? Or how about 28 million people in Venezuela? Or 82 million people in Iran? Giving voice to all whistleblowers and activists, especially the ones risking their lives and freedom in hostile environments is the fundamental goal of Pepe.</p>

<h3 id="darknets">Darknets</h3>

<p>There is already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">I2P</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet">Freenet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUnet">GNUnet</a> etc. We can run emails, message boards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kad_network">Kad</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> on top of them, maybe even use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> smart contracts for decentralized computing. All the technology is there, why bother with something new? Well, first of all, these are all amazing projects, there is nothing wrong with them. The peculiar thing, however, is none of them except BitTorrent (and perhaps Tor) gained much popularity, neither do we see any readily available censorship-resistant communication platforms. Why is that?</p>

<p>I claim there are 2 main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are hard to use. The “Unix is user-friendly, it is just picky about who its friends are.” aphorism still lives in most them: you may need to install a bunch of additional software (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a> or shared libraries) potentially dealing with a dependency hell on some platforms; read through sparse documentation and dead forums on optimal network, security, and sharing settings; carefully configure your router, computer, and client; install, study, and configure applications running on top of the darknet, i.e. repeat the steps. The reason why Tor became popular outside of research was not because it was first, but because of the hacky all-in-one Tor Browser Bundle with sane defaults.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They prefer purity to practicality. Instead of concentrating manpower on few specific use cases, most existing tools try to conquer the world: a new internet, interplanetary, infrastructure, an application framework, APIs, a Turing-complete language on the blockchain etc. This is great and all, it is general, conceptual, modular, extensible, and stackable—everything we like—but sometimes overengineering is just overengineering given the goal. And our goal here is not to make a technical revolution, but to help as many people as we can communicate without fear of retribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>BitTorrent evolved into something that is used by 150 million people worldwide, it seamlessly adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_exchange">PEX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">µTP</a>, trackerless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme">magnet links</a>, and people do not even know what the hell it all means. Even though proprietary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> thrived very similarly (at least before it was crippled by Microsoft), millions of its users did not even know what peer-to-peer meant, not to mention how it worked under the hood, it just did. These two systems succeeded not because of luck but rather as a result of some excellent product decisions. We need to learn from that and reiterate.</p>

<h2 id="pepe-overview">Pepe overview</h2>

<h3 id="user-level">User level</h3>

<p>For the messaging platform, I chose to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboard</a> similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaba_Channel">Futaba Channel</a>. While not the most popular type of forum, imageboards are extremely flexible and free of junk like authentication or karma, they promote anonymity in a very practical way, and over 30 million people are already familiar with them. Perhaps, I am not a big fan of their crowded old-school design, but the initial user traction is more important than my sense of beauty, we will refine the looks through time.</p>

<p>That is, the Pepe imageboard is going to be the only application running on top the Pepe darknet, they are in fact inseparable. This way, we can design the network specifically for this one use case. This brings both security and performance benefits. Joining the darknet can be as simple as double clicking the application, and users do not need to install or configure any third-party browsers or proxy servers, they can just go to <a href="http://localhost:8666/">localhost:8666</a> using Chrome, Safari, or whatever they like, and it is going to be safe without any third-party extensions.</p>

<p>Once online, users may browse existing or create new message boards about various topics in any language such as <code>/en/food/</code> or <code>/ja/math/</code>. A board is a collection of threads about something more specific, would it be an idea or a question. A thread has a collection of posts that people send replying to each other. Each post may have one or multiple attachments such as photos, videos, you name it. So that you have an idea of what it looks like, here is a screenshot of a random thread on the 4chan DIY board:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/4chan-thread.png" alt="4chan thread"></p>

<p>What is fundamentally different with Pepe is moderation. Instead of relying on a centralized entity with a banhammer, each board and thread owner may anonymously moderate their spaces on their own. However, nothing can actually be deleted, it can only be shadowed, and each user decides whether they want to see the light or the full version of the page at any moment in time. People can still reply to shadowed posts inside their own shadowed posts, so no one cannot silence anyone, only maintain order on the light side.</p>

<p>If people are no longer interested in particular threads, they will eventually become forgotten by the network and naturally disappear from their board. But if there is at least one person who is subscribed to or has archived some thread, no one in the world (even Pepe creators) can censor or somehow shut it down without hurting most of the network Pepe is running on top of.</p>

<h3 id="network-level">Network level</h3>

<p>The three biggest problems with 4chan and similar communication platforms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They use closed source software so no one can tell how secure everything is and what is really going on there.</li>
  <li>They are centralized, i.e. some individual or business owns the servers and fully controls the whole infrastructure.</li>
  <li>They collect lots of metadata including but not limited to “someone with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> posted this at this moment in time”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigating the first problem is the easiest: just use open-source software whenever possible. Regarding the centralization issue, we could switch to a decentralized solution like BitTorrent (imagine each torrent containing a thread with its posts and attachments), but that itself does not help with privacy, people can still see what others are doing. Similarly, we could tackle the privacy issue with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> or a darknet like Tor or I2P, but that, contrary to popular belief, does not solve the centralization issue in any way. Clearly, we need the best of the two worlds. Let us fuse them together!</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/pepe-routing.png" alt="Pepe routing"></p>

<p>Here is an very simplified walk through how the network works. Imagine Bob is an undercover journalist who wants to anonymously share his report and Alice is a political activist who is interested in the investigation Bob had been doing. It all starts with Bob announcing he has the report:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bob joins the network and gathers information about random peers on it through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>. This way, Bob discovers hundreds of participants including X and Y. Similarly, Bob registers himself on the network through the DHT so that others …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Today, we’re changing our name from TransferWise to Wise.</p>
<p>Our customers now need us for more than money transfers. Sending, spending, and receiving money internationally is too expensive, slow, and inconvenient. We’re fixing that for people and businesses.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/world-meet-wise#transferwise-is-now-wise">skip ahead to see what changes for you</a> (spoiler: not much, right away), but first, let’s go back a bit.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-decade-into-our-mission" id="a-decade-into-our-mission"></a>A decade into our mission</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, Taavet and I set out to fix international money transfers for all of us who’d been overcharged and underserved by banks. We named our idea ‘TransferWise’ — because our early customers were ‘wise’ to know their banks were charging hidden fees in exchange rate markups.</p>
<p>We set ourselves a mission to make money work without borders — to make money move instantly, transparently, conveniently, and — eventually — for free.</p>
<p>Now, we’re a community of 10 million like-minded people and businesses managing money all over the world, saving billions and fighting as hard as ever against hidden fees.</p>
<p>Our multi-currency account and the clever debit card is replacing international banking for many of you. By building this infrastructure for you, we’ve created a platform that more than a dozen banks use today.</p>
<p>You’ve told us for years the problem is bigger than money transfers. Any time money moves into another currency, it’s still a maze of hidden exchange rate markups, high fees, delays, and small print.</p>
<h2><a href="#well-fix-international-banking-together" id="well-fix-international-banking-together"></a>We’ll fix international banking together</h2>
<p>Sending, spending, receiving, and holding money internationally doesn’t work like it should, because the international banking system was built for the past.</p>
<p>For generations, banks have been defined by borders. Traditional bank accounts trap our money in one country, making international lives more difficult and expensive than they need to be. We shouldn’t have to accept this status quo.</p>
<p>Today, we don’t. We’ll fix it with Wise — the world’s most international account. It makes your money borderless — with instant, super-cheap money transfers, a debit card to spend in any currency, account details to get paid in 30+ countries, balances to hold your money safely in 50+ different currencies, multi-currency direct debits, and other revolutionary features.</p>
<h2><a href="#transferwise-is-now-wise" id="transferwise-is-now-wise"></a>TransferWise is now Wise</h2>
<p>Today our name catches up with who we’re already building for — a community of people and businesses with multi-currency lives. Wise is for all of us who live, work, travel, or support family around the world. It’s for those of us who want to cut out the middlemen that hold us back from being truly borderless.</p>
<p>For customers, not too much will change right away. We become “Wise” or “Wise Business” — depending how you use us. You can access your exact same account via <a href="http://wise.com/">wise.com</a>, using your current email and password. You won't need a new account. In a few weeks we will start to redirect transferwise.com to wise.com.</p>
<p>Our logo has changed, and our apps will be renamed. But our icon — the fast flag — remains as a symbol for money without borders. Beyond that, you’ll notice some new colours, words, and designs.</p>
<p>The core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We’re still making — and always will be making — money work without borders.</p>
<p>We’re humbled that 10 million of you already rely on us to help you lead your international lives. We can’t wait to bring the next 100 million of you with us as we continue to build a new, fair, and transparent world of money.</p>
<p>Onwards.</p>

<p><em>Loss of focus</em>, even for a moment, is always detrimental to what we are doing. That is quite obvious at pro-level sports disciplines - the moment you lose focus, your opponent takes advantage and scores.
In the end of the day, if you want to be a “pro” in any discipline, you need to learn how to sustain your focus for long periods of time.
Always being present and in the now. I came to this realisation while watching the Australian Open finals this year.
I guess that’s also amongst the reasons why the crowd could play a vital role in most games.
It could be both a distracting and a “get yourself together” force for players on the field.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong>, that seems to be valid for everything we do in our lives and everything we work on.
Why “unfortunately”? Well, as it isn’t obvious.
We don’t always have that opponent waiting for our mistake to score. So we lose track.
And we lose focus very easily without any apparent repercussions.
Then, we still want to be pro and play the majors, and we wonder why that isn’t happening. It also happens that we blame external circumstances. At the same time,
the simple truth is that we just can’t sustain our focus at a pro-level.</p>

<p><strong>Fortunately</strong>, that is something that we have control over, and as long as we are willing to develop that skill - we can play the majors. In any discipline.</p>

      <p>My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.</p>

<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2021/7f4522c3f4.jpg"></p>

<p>That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?</p>

<p>So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.</p>

<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2021/0c4028d20c.jpg"></p>

<p>And TransLink, the local public transport provider, had neglected to renew the domain name used in the NFC tag.</p>

<p>I now own the <a href="http://transl.in/">transl.in</a> domain name and the people of the Gold Coast now have easy access to my website. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>As an example, a local bus stop links to <a href="http://transl.in/k_300428">http://transl.in/k_300428</a></p>

However, what if there were languages that were not created to be used? Ones that test the boundaries of programming language design and cause even the most experienced programmers to bang their heads against the wall trying to build a simple program? Enter esoteric programming languages.<h2>What Are Esoteric Programming Languages?</h2> Most programming languages are designed for the purpose of widespread use and productivity. However, Esoteric programming languages (esolang) are a segment of programming languages that are not built for usability, but rather for entertainment, artistic intent, or to prove a concept. The word "esoteric" is <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/esoteric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derived from the Greek word "esoterikos"</a>, which means “belonging to an inner circle”. Esoteric languages are not intended to be widely understood.<h2>The Purpose of Esoteric Languages</h2> The first-ever esoteric programming language was <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTERCAL</a>. A parody created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Woods</a> and James M. Lyon in 1972 that mimicked popular languages at the time, such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/">COBOL.</a> The idea was later revived in 1993 when Wouter van Oortmerssen designed <a href="http://strlen.com/false-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FALSE</a>. The concept was to build a powerful, tiny implementation (compiler executable of 1024 bytes) programming language with an obfuscated syntax that was disorienting to its users. From here, more recognizable names such as <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Befunge</a> began to emerge and the concept of esoteric languages began to take shape as a concept.  As previously stated, esoteric languages have four main purposes. To act as a proof of concept, for competitive sport, display an artistic process and simply for entertainment. To better grasp these ideas, let's look into each of them with an example language.<h3>Proof of Concept (Brainfuck)</h3> The first purpose of esoteric languages we are going to look at is proof of concept. A language that was able to present a proof of concept to the computer science community was <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainfuck.</a> A minimalist programming language that contains an astonishing eight characters in total while still proving to be <a href="https://medium.com/@evinsellin/what-exactly-is-turing-completeness-a08cc36b26e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing-complete</a>. The language should not be used for practical projects due to its complexity at scale (as the name suggests). However, it is interesting to see that a programming language can have its utilities with such a small amount of primitives. Here is an example of the language:  <h3>Competitive (Malbolge)</h3> Esoteric languages can also be viewed in a competitive context, such as Malbolge. Languages like Malbolge were created with the sole intent to be exceptionally incomprehensible and difficult to use. Achieved through self-modification, non-intuitive operators and encryption, Malbolge is one of the hardest programming languages to learn. It also very well could be the first of its kind for this purpose in mind. The competition revolving around Malbolge is contained within the premise of the language. That anyone able to make a useful program with Malbolge deserves bragging rights. Here's a sample of how difficult the language is to use.  <h3>Artistic (Shakespeare)</h3> The third purpose of esolang's are for artistic purposes. A popular example of this is the <a href="http://shakespearelang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakespeare language</a>. A unique programming language that is meant to resemble the writing from Shakespearean plays. The language is unique, as it redefines the entire programming paradigm. Instead of focusing on producing an intended result, the goal is to make the code itself look more elegant. If only all our code looked as clean as this!  <h3>Entertainment (COW)</h3> Finally, some esoteric programming languages are simply meant to be entertaining.&nbsp; Such as the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COW language by Sean Heber</a>. As a derivative of the Brainfuck language mentioned above, COW only has 12 primitive. All of which are different capitalizations of the word 'moo'. It's hard to imagine why someone would go through so much effort to create this language. In a way, this comical language really does grasp what programming is all about: incredibly frustrating, a little silly and most importantly, fun.  <h2>The Interesting Thing About Esoteric Languages</h2> So that's pretty much all you need to know about esoteric programming languages. In a strange way, they are like the 'conceptual art' of the programming world. Unconventional and weird, but often thought-provoking and fascinating. Esoteric languages break the recycled formula that most conventional languages follow. Making me believe that these languages could one day be the key to new applications of programming.  Although, if nothing else, they are fascinating designs to look at. Which remain untouched over years, without the over looming necessity to stay 'current' like the majority of popular languages today. Allowing them to only become more interesting with age.  You can check out a full list of esoteric programming languages, <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> If you have anything to add, I would love to hear it in the comment section below!

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Say you run an online book store and want to build a data pipeline that figures out who the top-selling authors are. Logically, the input to the pipeline is a log of every individual book purchase on the store for all time, along with details about each book like who authored it. And the output is a list of the top-selling authors per month.</p>

<!-- [image: book purchases + authorship info -> top-selling authors of the month] -->

</figure>
</div>

<p>The output of this data pipeline is a function of the input. In other words, the output is derived from the input by running the input through the pipeline.</p>

<!-- [image: f(input) -> output] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>

    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This is an important characteristic of the output. As long as the input data and pipeline transformations (i.e. the pipeline code) are preserved, the output can always be recreated. The input data is <em>primary</em>; if lost, it cannot be replaced. The output data, along with any intermediate stages in the pipeline, are <em>derivative</em>; they can always be recreated from the primary data using the pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="the-logical-view">The Logical View</h2>

<p>Let’s represent our hypothetical “Top-Selling Authors” pipeline as a directed graph, where the nodes represent datasets and the edges represent transformations of those datasets. Furthermore, let’s color each dataset in the graph based on whether it’s primary or derivative.</p>

<!-- [image: colored graph of transformations] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/pipeline-graph.png" width="500">

</figure>
</div>

<p>Most data pipelines, if you zoom out far enough, look something like this. You have some source data; it gets sliced, diced, and combined in various ways to produce some outputs. If someone were to wipe out all the derived data in this pipeline, you’d be able to regenerate it without any data loss. The pipeline could include any number of arbitrary steps, like copying files from an FTP share, or scraping data from a web page. It doesn’t matter as long as the pipeline produces the same output when given the same input.</p>

<p>Any time someone queries the output of the pipeline, it’s logically equivalent to them running the entire pipeline on the source data to get the output they’re looking for. In this way, a pipeline is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/views?view=sql-server-ver15">view</a> into the source data.</p>

<h2 id="materializing-the-view">Materializing the View</h2>

<p>Of course, data pipelines don’t work this way in practice. It would be a waste of resources and a long wait for users if every query triggered a series of computations stretching all the way back to the primary data. When you ask for this month’s top-selling authors, you expect a quick response.</p>

<p>Hence, the typical real-world pipeline <em>materializes</em> its output, and often also several of the intermediate datasets required to produce that final output. Materializing a dataset simply means saving it to persistent storage, as opposed to repeatedly computing it on the fly. So when you ask for that list of authors, whatever system answering your query can start from the closest materialized dataset, as opposed to starting at the source or primary data.</p>

<!-- [image: cached nodes in graph colored; key explaining colors; caption] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/pipeline-with-cached-nodes.png" width="500">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    A query against dataset B only needs to recompute the pipeline starting from A, since A is materialized.
    All derivative datasets, whether materialized or not, can be thrown away and recreated from the primary data.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>So we’ve turned our view into a <em>materialized view</em>. “View” represents the logical transformations expressed in the pipeline. “Materialized” represents the fact that we cache the output of the pipeline, and perhaps also some of the intermediate steps. A complex set of interdependent data pipelines can be conceptualized in this way, as a graph of materialized views.</p>

<p>Note that this concept can be applied very broadly, and not just to what we think of as “normal” data pipelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A traditional web cache alleviates read traffic from the primary database, which is the source of truth. The cache is derivative and can be regenerated from the database at any time. The data in the cache is materialized so that incoming queries do not need to go all the way back to the database to get an answer.</li>
  <li>A build system compiles or assembles source code into artifacts like executables or test reports. The artifacts are derivative, whereas the source code is primary. When you run a program over and over, you reuse the artifacts output by your build system, as opposed to recompiling them from source every time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="updating-a-materialized-view">Updating a Materialized View</h2>

<p>Materializing the output, though a practical necessity for most pipelines, adds an administrative cost. When the source data changes, the materialized views need to be updated. Otherwise, the data you get from the view will be <em>stale</em>.</p>

<!-- [image: highlighted new source row; out-of-date output aggregation] -->

<figure>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>To update a materialized view, there are two high-level properties you typically care about: the update <em>trigger</em>, and the update <em>granularity</em>. The former affects the freshness of your output, which impacts end-users of the data, and the latter affects the performance of your update process, which impacts the engineers or operators responsible for that process.</p>

<h3 id="update-trigger">Update Trigger</h3>

<p>The update trigger is the event that prompts a refresh of the materialized view—e.g. by running your pipeline against the latest source data.</p>

<p>That event may be a file landing in a shared drive, or some data arriving on an event stream, or another pipeline completing. For some pipelines, the update trigger may just be a certain time of day, in which case it might be more useful to talk about the update <em>frequency</em> rather than trigger.</p>

<p>A typical batch pipeline, for example, might run on a daily or hourly cadence, whereas a streaming pipeline may run every few seconds or minutes, or whenever a new event is delivered via some sort of event stream. Whenever the pipeline runs, it updates its output, and the whole process can be viewed as a <em>refresh</em> of the materialized view.</p>

<h3 id="update-granularity">Update Granularity</h3>

<p>The update granularity refers to how much of the materialized view needs to be modified to account for the latest changes to the source data.</p>

<p>A common update granularity is the full refresh. No matter how small or large the change to the source data, when the pipeline runs it throws away the entire output table and rebuilds it from scratch.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated pipeline might rebuild only a subset of the table, like a date partition. And an extremely precise pipeline may know how to update exactly the output rows that are impacted by the latest changes to the source data.</p>

<p>The update trigger and granularity are independent. You can have a pipeline that runs every second and does a full refresh of its output, and you can have a pipeline that runs once a day but carefully updates only the rows that it needs to.</p>

<h3 id="typical-examples">Typical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s explore these two properties a bit using our example pipeline that computes the top-selling authors of the month.</p>

<h4 id="the-daily-batch-update">The Daily Batch Update</h4>

<p>Every night at 1 a.m., an automated process looks for a dump of the latest purchases from the previous day. The dump is a compressed CSV file.</p>

<p>The update process uses this dump to recompute the month’s sales numbers for all authors. It replaces the entire output table with all-new calculations for all authors. Many of the authors’ numbers may not have changed since the last update (because they had no new sales in that time period), but they all get recomputed nonetheless.</p>

<p>This is a very typical example of a batch pipeline. It has a scheduled update trigger at 1 a.m. every night, and an update granularity of the entire output.</p>

<h4 id="the-live-updating-table">The Live-Updating Table</h4>

<p>In this version of our top-selling authors pipeline, individual purchases are streamed in as they happen, via a stream processor like Apache Kafka. Every purchase on this stream triggers an update to the calculation of top-selling authors.</p>

<p>The update process uses each individual purchase to incrementally recompute the sales total for the relevant author. If an author has no new sales over a given span of updates, their sales total is not recomputed (though their rank in the top-selling authors may need to be updated).</p>

<p>This is an example of a precise streaming pipeline. The update trigger is the purchase event that is streamed in, and the update granularity is the sales total for a single author.</p>

<h2 id="the-declarative-data-lake">The Declarative Data Lake</h2>

<p>We previously discussed the idea of conceptualizing your <a href="https://nchammas.com/writing/modern-data-lake-database">data lake as a database</a>. And here we’ve shown how you can conceptualize your data pipelines as materialized views.</p>

<p>But what if we could take this idea further than just as a conceptual tool? What if you could actually implement your data pipelines as a graph of materialized views?</p>

<p>Taken far enough, the promise of such an idea would be to build a <em>declarative data lake</em>, where the code that manages the lake focuses more on defining <em>what</em> the datasets are and less on <em>how</em> to mechanically build or update them.</p>

<p>Two relatively new projects express aspects of this vision in clear but different ways, and they merit some discussion here: <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> and <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dbt-pipelines-as-batch-updated-sql-queries">dbt: Pipelines as Batch-Updated SQL Queries</h3>

<p>The core of <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> is an engine for building <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction#what-makes-dbt-so-powerful">a graph of SQL queries</a>. Parts of any given query can be generated dynamically using a templating language (<a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/using-jinja/">Jinja</a>), and queries can reference other queries.</p>

<p>Every query has a configured materialization strategy, which defines whether the results of the query are generated ahead of time, and if so, how they are stored and updated.</p>

<p>If the results are materialized, they can be updated with a full refresh or <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models/#understanding-incremental-models">incrementally</a>, though there are some restrictions on what kinds of updates can be done incrementally. Updates are typically triggered on a schedule.</p>

<h3 id="materialize-pipelines-as-live-updated-materialized-views">Materialize: Pipelines as Live-Updated Materialized Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a> is an engine for building live, incrementally updated materialized views from streaming sources like Apache Kafka. A view can reference other live-updated views, as well as fixed tables.</p>

<p>The primary interface for creating these views is plain and elegant: A <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/"><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code></a> SQL statement.</p>

<p>Conceptually, this is roughly the same statement that is available in

			<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics says that&nbsp;you can have a particle spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time – until you look at it, at which point it definitely becomes one or the other. The theory claims that&nbsp;observing reality fundamentally changes it.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics says that when you observe or interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it. At the very least, you are to blame for not doing <em>more</em>. Even if you don’t make the problem worse, even if you make it slightly better, the ethical burden of the problem falls on you as soon as you observe it. In particular, if you interact with a problem and benefit from it, you are a complete monster. I don’t subscribe to this school of thought, but it seems pretty popular.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/nyregion/09placebo.html?_r=2&amp;hpAlways=&amp;pagewanted=all">New York randomly chose homeless applicants to participate in its Homebase program</a>, and tracked those who were not allowed into the program as a control group. The program was helping as many people as it could, the only change was explicitly labeling a number of people it wasn’t helping as a “control group”. The response?</p>
<blockquote><p>“They should immediately stop this experiment,” said the Manhattan borough president, <a title="More articles about Scott M. Stringer." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/scott_m_stringer/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Scott M. Stringer</a>. “The city shouldn’t be making guinea pigs out of its most vulnerable.”</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On March 11th, 2012, the vast majority of people did nothing to help homeless people. They were busy doing other things, many of them good and important things, but&nbsp;by and large not improving the well-being of homeless humans in any way. In particular, almost no one was doing anything for the homeless of Austin, Texas. BBH Labs was an exception – they outfitted 13 homeless volunteers with WiFi hotspots and asked them to offer WiFi to SXSW attendees&nbsp;in exchange for donations. In return, they would be paid $20 a day plus whatever attendees gave in donations. Each of these 13 volunteers chose this over all the other things they could have done that day, and benefited from it – not a vast improvement, but significantly more than the 0 improvement that they were getting from most people.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/03/the-damning-backstory-behind-homeless-hotspots-at-sxswi/">response</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p><span tabindex="-1">IT SOUNDS LIKE </span>something out of a <a href="http://nytsxsw.tumblr.com/post/19145988299/getting-a-decent-data-connection-at-sxsw-can-be-a">darkly satirical science-fiction dystopia</a>. But it’s absolutely real — and a completely problematic treatment of a problem that otherwise probably wouldn’t be mentioned in any of the panels at South by Southwest Interactive.</p></blockquote>
<p>There wouldn’t be any scathing editorials if BBH Labs had just chosen to do nothing – but they&nbsp;did something helpful-but-not-maximally-helpful, and thus are open to judgment.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are times when it’s almost impossible to get a taxi – when there’s inclement weather, when a large event is getting out, or when it’s just a very busy day. Uber attempts to solve this problem by introducing surge pricing – charging more when demand outstrips supply. More money means more drivers willing to make the trip, means more rides available. Now instead of having no taxis at all, people can choose between an expensive taxi or no taxi at all – a marginal improvement.&nbsp;Needless to say, Uber has been repeatedly lambasted for doing something instead of leaving the even-worse status quo the way it was.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gender inequality is a persistent, if hard to quantify, problem. <a href="http://blog.jaibot.com/?p=392">Last year I blogged</a> about how amoral agents could save money and drive the wage gap down to 0 by offering slightly less-sexist wages – while including some caveats about how it was probably unrealistic and we wouldn’t see anything like that in reality.&nbsp;So of course <em><strong>less than a week after I wrote that&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/evan-thornley-causes-stir-with-sexist-comments-at-sunrise-startup-conference-20140922-10kiku.html" target="_blank">Evan Thornley says</a>&nbsp;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a great arbitrage there, we would give [women] more responsibility and a greater share of the rewards than they were likely to get anywhere else and that was still often relatively cheap to someone less good of a different gender.”</p>
<p>While Mr Thornley said he wasn’t advocating that the gender pay gap should be perpetuated, he said it provided “an opportunity for forward thinking people”.</p>
<p>A number of online commentators, as well as Australian start-up blogs, have since said Mr Thornley’s comments were sexist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Thornley improved on the status quo – but in the process he interacted the problem and was thus caught up in it. This is a strategy which, if widely embraced, would practically eliminate&nbsp;many forms of wage discrimination overnight simply by harnessing something we have way too much of already: greed. So of course it was denounced.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last year the city of Detroit began to crack down on unpaid water bills, and thousands of poor people suddenly faced the prospect of having their water shut off. The vast majority of people did nothing to help them whatsoever. PETA did offer conditional help: If a family went vegan for 30 days, PETA would pay off their water bill, and throw in a basket of vegan food to boot. This was strictly more helpful than what 99.99999% of humanity was doing for Detroit residents at the time, as it didn’t make anything worse and offered a trade for anyone who valued 30 days of not-being-vegan less than however much they owed on their water bill. For marginally improving he situation instead of ignoring it, they were <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/07/24/3464033/peta-is-the-worst/" target="_blank">denounced as “the worst”</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peter Singer has a famous thought experiment about a child&nbsp;drowning in a pond. I’ll let <a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/post/120721529553/peter-singers-drowning-child-argument" target="_blank">Philosophy Bro</a> explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like, let’s say I’m on my way to a bitchin’ party and I’m looking fly as shit and I smell good because <i>you already know</i>, and I’ve got a 30-rack of Natty because I’ll be goddamned if I show up empty-handed to the house I’m about to burn down. Once I get over this bridge, and turn the corner I’ve arrived and so has the party. Except I hear a bunch of splashing and I look over the bridge into the river and – fuck me – there’s a kid flailing around and calling for help, like he’s drowning for some reason instead of handling his shit like an adult.</p>
<p>I should save his life, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes in philosophy we like to ask obvious questions and waggle our eyebrows suggestively, like maybe you don’t exist after all, <i>hmm</i>? but bro, this is not one of those times. I should obviously jump in and SAVE THIS FUCKING CHILD’S LIFE. So I ruin a Polo and I don’t smell good anymore and a couple of the beers explode because I dropped them. Who gives a shit, right? A child was going to die.</p>
<p>…[snip]…</p>
<p>What if I told you that for $5, you could buy a life-saving vaccine for a child? Sure, he’s far away, but we already agreed: who gives a shit, right? It’ll still save his life, and it only costs you not having a fifth drink at the bar on a Thursday. Remember that $300 bar receipt you posted with the caption “just another Thursday night wearing matching plaid with my bros, we’re special and impressive and are the ACTUAL six dudes with the biggest dicks, unlike all you OTHER overconfidences of bros who think that, well guess what, it’s us?” What you were really saying was “I routinely pass up the chance to save two dozen lives with science so that I can black out and pretend that I like myself for a night.” That’s fucked up, bro.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference is that the drowning child has been definitively noticed, and thus her moral weight bears down on us and we have to save her. But children thousands of miles away? Not noticed!</p>
<p>I think this might be where a lot of the discomfort with talking about things we can do to alleviate suffering comes from. If you implicitly believe in the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics, then to confront the scope of suffering in the world is to make it your fault, and then if you don’t throw everything you have at the problem you’re as “bad” as PETA or Mr. Thornley or Uber or BBH Labs.</p>
<p>But what if – what if noticing a problem didn’t make it any worse? What if we could act on&nbsp;a problem and not feel horrible for making it just a little better, even if it was an action that benefited ourselves as well? What if we said that in these instances, these groups weren’t evil – it’s okay to notice a problem and only make it a little bit better. If everyone did that, the world would be a vastly better place. If everyone “exploited” opportunities where they could benefit and alleviate people’s suffering at the same time, we’d all be better off.</p>

It will be followed soon by a “tutorial” of sorts, walking through an <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed-totp-pc-tutorial">implementation of TOTP</a> (time-based one-time password, a commonly used second factor authentication method) in minimal form on PC.</p><p>We’re not just announcing, we’re also releasing the source code, dual-licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses, on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/">https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/</a>. This code is still very much a work in progress, and does not yet come with stable functionality or API promises. However, we think the time has come to continue further work in public, so we may learn from the open source community.</p><p>“We” here are not just SoloKeys, but also <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/" title="Nitrokey">Nitrokey</a>, our competitor-slash-collaborator from Germany that has always used SoloKeys firmware in their web authentication products, and will continue to do so. <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/" title="Nitrokey">Nitrokey</a> will have their own announcement on this topic and their further plans for security keys here.</p><p>Together, we loosely build the current “Trussed Alliance” of Trussed implementers, users, and evangelists. We are reachable by several means, for instance via email at <a href="mailto:alliance@trussed.dev">alliance@trussed.dev</a>, by Matrix chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trussed:matrix.org">#trussed:matrix.org</a>, or async at <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/discussions">github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/discussions</a>. We are very interested in and open to additional allies. Particularly, at this stage, those with strong (correct) opinions, and the drive to contribute to the implementation :)</p><h3 id="but-what-is-trussed">But what is Trussed?</h3><p>You may be aware of PKCS #11 (<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-ug/v2.40/pkcs11-ug-v2.40.html">usage guide</a>), which – despite all of its warts – is a standardized, high-level, platform-independent API, enabling software to make use of hardware-backed cryptography. There are other APIs in a similar spirit, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">WebCrypto</a> by the W3C (with its own warts, and notably relaying JavaScript applications to software implementations of cryptography), or <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec">PARSEC</a> (backed by Arm and Docker, which has a rather more grand scope).</p><p>All of these have in common that applications can outsource their cryptographic needs to a trusted third party implementation through a common API. Secret keys can be generated for various algorithms or mechanisms (symmetric cryptography such as AES, asymmetric cryptography such as P256, Ed25519, X25519, RSA, etc.). The application obtains not the sensitive key material, but instead a handle object, with which it can then perform further operations: sign data, verify signatures, encrypt or decrypt data, etc.</p><p>The core idea of Trussed is this: What if there were similar facilities – without the warts – right inside the firmware of embedded devices?</p><p>Thinking further: What if these were provided by idiomatic, misuse-resistant, best cryptographic practice-following APIs? What if the list of available cryptographic mechanisms, together with their software or hardware implementations, were flexibly configurable at compile time, but came with “batteries included”? What if this “crypto-in-a-box” would be easy to plug into whatever setup one is already using? What if applications, then, could focus on implementing their domain-specific logic and interfaces with the outside world, while taking advantage of <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html">one cryptographic joint, kept well oiled.</a></p><p>And that is exactly what Trussed is!</p><h3 id="portable-trussed-apps">Portable Trussed apps</h3><p>You may see the term “Trussed app”. By this we mean any unit of firmware that uses the Trussed APIs, and otherwise is completely cross-platform (meanwhile, it will be called externally by the runtime/scheduler). To repeat, a Trussed app is called externally, but internally only calls Trussed APIs – this makes it portable to all platforms on which Trussed itself runs on.</p><p>Two prime examples would be the FIDO and PIV authenticator apps by SoloKeys. In the past (with the existing Solo V1 key C firmware), when others wanted to “somehow reuse” app code it didn’t really work – forks happened, or even simple copy-pastes. Similarly, Google’s FIDO2 implementation in <a href="https://github.com/google/OpenSK">OpenSK</a> is tightly coupled to the Tock OS around it, and limited to devices which have Tock OS support.</p><p>By decoupling from runtimes, and making minimal requirements on Trussed platforms, we envision that “Trussed apps” will be shareable between vendors (each adding their own runtime and physical product). That bug fixes and functionality additions can be shared. That alternative implementations of existing applications are possible (e.g., a <a href="https://github.com/dicekeys/seeding-webauthn">DiceKeys</a>-backed FIDO2 app).</p><p>Generally, we would like to open up an ecosystem of “Trussed apps” (WireGuard, password managers, GPG for those that like it, pocket HSMs, etc.), eventually replacing JavaCard and bringing embedded cryptographic firmware to the modern age.</p><h3 id="trussed-components">Trussed Components</h3><p>There are two major components in Trussed, the service, and the clients.</p><p>The service depends on platform resources (storage, entropy, UI facilities), bundles up cryptographic algorithm implementations at compile time, and is then just a beefy component with a “process” method. This method needs to be called by the runtime/scheduler, either regularly, or on-demand via a provided syscall abstraction.</p><p>The service’s storage is partitioned by client, and further by type of object the service is responsible for managing on a client’s behalf: A key store for cryptographic keys, a file store for binary metadata (exposed as a POSIX-ish filesystem interface), and a certificate store.</p><p>The clients correspondingly have APIs (for crypto, file and other needs) to send requests with, for instance a “CryptoClient + P256 + HmacSha256”. Client and service communicate via <a href="https://docs.rs/interchange">interchanges</a>, shared memory areas in which requests and replies are placed. Both the requests and replies are modeled as Rust types, so there is no low-level memory copying and length calculations. Additionally, interchanges serve as a strong demarcation between different privileged executions (such as the secure and nonsecure worlds in ARM TrustZone).</p><h3 id="what-is-trussed-not">What is Trussed not?</h3><p>Trussed intends to be a configurable box you can use with ease in your firmware, but it does not intend to take over your entire platform. It is not an embedded operating system. Trussed does not use the heap, all variables are allocated on the stack. Trussed does not internally use threads in any way, control flow is linear and predictable.</p><p>To create a functional product, besides a Trussed platform, you need to supply:</p><ul><li>runtime/scheduler: with SoloKeys, we use <a href="https://rtic.rs/">RTIC</a> (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency), which is a thin software wrapper around the Arm Cortex-M NVIC hardware scheduler. Conceivably, something like <a href="https://www.tockos.org/">Tock</a> should work, or threaded scheduling on PC</li><li>interfaces: with SoloKeys, we use <a href="https://docs.rs/usb-device">usb-device</a> as a framework to implement USB classes (CTAPHID, CCID) on top of our <a href="https://github.com/lpc55/lpc55-hal">LPC55 HAL</a> (hardware abstraction layer), and our own NFC device framework</li><li>dispatch: depending on the richness of the runtime, there may be separate need to dispatch between multiple interfaces and multiple applications</li><li>secure manufacturing: Trussed has the concept of “device attestation”, binding a unique identifier for the chip it runs on to private device attestation keys (Ed255 + P256), via a vendor certificate authority. Further it has a concept of “key attestation”, attesting keys on the device as being generated on the device and not being extractable, via the device attestation keys and certificates. While Trussed exposes methods to do this, they rely on preparations that depend on the platform and need to be done in the manufacturing process.</li><li>optionally, a secure signed firmware update procedure: conceivably, Trussed might be used in a custom bootloader, but the compile-time security of Trussed comes from firmware “bundles” being verified by a vendor. There needs to be a way to ensure any changes to the firmware are “atomic” and authorized, replacing the entire bundle of runner + apps + Trussed with a new non-compromised setup (operating on the existing data).</li></ul><h3 id="first-implementation">First Implementation</h3><p>SoloKeys <a href="https://solokeys.com/blogs/news/our-solo-v2-campaign-launches-on-january-26th">will be releasing the first products built with Trussed</a>. Their Solo v2 authenticators are fully open source and designed for enterprise use for FIDO2 and PIV. More applications are to follow, all based on Trussed.</p><p><img src="https://trussed.dev/images/uploads/solov2.png" alt="Solo V2" title="Solo V2"></p><h3 id="what-about-the-trademark">What about the trademark?</h3><p>To conclude, we would like to explain why Trussed sometimes has a registered trademark symbol next to it. First off, as mentioned, the source code itself is permissively dual-licensed. There is no intent for any “open core” kind of license/monetization scheme (some reasoning that resonates is <a href="https://250bpm.com/blog:15/">here</a>). We consider the ideas expressed in Trussed to be public domain, and really just an (ongoing) distillation of best practices.</p><p>However, when a vendor wishes to sell a product, and advertise that it is “Built on Trussed”, has “Trussed® Inside”, or similar (in effect, profit from the trust we will build in Trussed!), we would like to be able to ensure that basic requirements are fulfilled for the platform, applications and product manufacturing chain – this is needed to make a secure product.</p><p>As an example, Trussed ensures keys are kept secret by storing them encrypted-at-rest at all times. It can do so either by using a backing storage that is encrypted by hardware, or adding a software encryption layer itself – one or the other, but it needs to be ensured.</p><p>As another example, Trussed needs a source of entropy. Ideally, a platform has a hardware source, alternatively, the manufacturing process can inject an entropic seed – again, one or the other (or both) need to be ensured.</p><p>To sum up, we hope that you find use for Trussed in your products. The more eyes, the better! If you do use Trussed, we’d like you to advertise that you do. In this case, please contact <a href="mailto:alliance@trussed.dev">alliance@trussed.dev</a> so we can discuss. There is no formal certification process at this point.</p><h3 id="some-more-details-about-portability">Some more details about portability</h3><p>Cryptographic implementations …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Svelte lures developers with the promise of better performance and smaller bundle size than competitors like React. But, since it is new, its eco-system is small. Let's change that!
    </p>
<p>There are many differences between Svelte and React. Svelte is a compiler, while React lives in the browser. Svelte components are written into '.svelte' files, while React uses <code><code>jsx</code></code>/<code><code>tsx</code></code>. React has the virtual DOM while, Svelte doesn't. So, are these frameworks so different, that we have to write every library from scratch?
    </p>
<p>No.
    </p>
<p>I took a React library, which I like, and translated it to Svelte. It is a good excercise to see what the real differences between React and Svelte are, and to see which concepts are related. The library I chose is <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-auto-sizer"><code><code>react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code></a>. It has unimpressive 295 stars as a standalone library at github, but it belongs to the <code><code>react-virtualized</code></code> library, which is currently at 21 thousand stars. For comparison, the highest rated Svelte specific library besides Svelte and Sapper is <code><code>svelte-material-ui</code></code> with 1.5k stars. The <code><code>auto-sizer</code></code> allows your component to grow or shrink to the available space on your page.
    </p>

<h2 id="PortingAuto-Sizer">Porting Auto-Sizer
    </h2>

    </blockquote>
<p>The library <code><code>react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code> has only one exported component, so it is quite a low-hanging fruit to port. It is older, so it is implemented as a React class component. React component have more lifecycle methods than in Svelte, so it may be hard or impossible to reproduce the same behavior. In this case it will be no problem.
    </p>

<h3 id="AutoSizercomponent">AutoSizer component
    </h3>

<p>There are only two files of interest in the library. The first file is <code><code>src/vendor/detectElementResize.js</code></code> and it contains only code, that is independent of React. So, I could simply copy it into my project. The other file is <code><code>src/index.js</code></code>. The author used <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> for static type checking, so it starts with a lot of type definitions. Other than that, the file just holds the component source code.
    </p>
<p>In the root of my new project <a href="https://github.com/micha-lmxt/svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer"><code><code>svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code></a> I create a file <code><code>AutoSizer.svelte</code></code>.
    </p>
<h4 id="Props">Props
    </h4>

<p>First, in the scripts part I've put all props of the React component, except children and style. Both of these are handled a bit differently in Svelte. Some of the props have a default, so I copied that over:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>AutoSizer</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>PureComponent</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Props</span><span>,</span><span> State</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>static</span><span> defaultProps </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>onResize</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{},</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>disableHeight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>disableWidth</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>style</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>This becomes the following:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let onResize = () =&gt; </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let disableHeight = false;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let disableWidth = false;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let className = "";</span></span>
<span><span>    export let defaultHeight = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let defaultWidth = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let nonce = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    ...</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="State">State
    </h4>

<p>The React component defines a state variable and a few class member:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>defaultHeight</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>defaultWidth</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>  _parentNode</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>HTMLElement</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>HTMLElement</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>_detectElementResize</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>DetectElementResize</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>which both become simple state variables in Svelte:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>defaultHeight</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>defaultWidth</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>_parentNode</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_detectElementResize</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>

<h4 id="componentDidMountandcomponentWillUnmount">componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
    </h4>

<p>The code from the <code><code>componentDidMount</code></code> and <code><code>componentWillUnmount</code></code> member functions is put into Sveltes <code><code>onMount</code></code> and <code><code>onDestroy</code></code> callbacks respecitvely.
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>() </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>nonce</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>      </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>_autoSizer</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>The variable unloading (<code><code>const {nonce}...</code></code>) is deleted and also all <code><code>this</code></code>-s are also removed (thank you vs-code find-and-replace function :) ):
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>onMount</span><span>(</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>            </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="_onResize">_onResize
    </h4>

<p>The "<code><code>_onResize = () =&gt; {...</code></code>" member becomes a const function "<code><code>const _onResize = () =&gt; {...</code></code>". Again, props unloading is deleted. The React component uses <code><code>width</code></code> and <code><code>height</code></code> again, so I had to rename the new consts to <code><code>width_</code></code> and <code><code>height_</code></code>. And the <code><code>setState</code></code> part is changed:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>        (</span><span>!</span><span>disableHeight</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>newHeight</span><span>) </span><span>||</span></span>
<span><span>        (</span><span>!</span><span>disableWidth</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>newWidth</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>      ) </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>          </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingTop</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingBottom</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>          </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingLeft</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingRight</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>to simple assignment:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>        (</span><span>!</span><span>disableHeight</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>newHeight</span><span>) </span><span>||</span></span>
<span><span>        (</span><span>!</span><span>disableWidth</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>newWidth</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    ) </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>height_</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingTop</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingBottom</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>width_</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingLeft</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>paddingRight</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="render">render
    </h4>

<p>So far, there have been no significant changes. Syntax is a little bit different, but not much. For the <code><code>render</code></code> function we got a little more to do. Let's break this down to four steps.
    </p>
<p>Step 1 - Styling: The React code defines a <code><code>outerStyle</code></code> object
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>() </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>   </span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>outerStyle</span><span>:</span><span> Object </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>overflow</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>visible</span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and in the code the height and the width of this style object can be set to 0. In Svelte, inline styling is not supplied as an object, but as a string. An equivalent implementation is straight forward, but I take a different route here, since Svelte makes it easier to avoid inline styling. I create two boolean variables <code><code>let outerstylewidth = false, outerstyleheight = false</code></code>, which are set to true, when the <code><code>width</code></code> or <code><code>height</code></code> style would have been set to 0 by the React component. Then I add the following style element to the <code><code>.svelte</code></code> file and make the two classes conditional with the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/classes"><code><code>class:</code></code> directive</a>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;style&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    div {</span></span>
<span><span>        overflow: visible;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    .outerstylewidth {</span></span>
<span><span>        width:0;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    .outerstyleheight{</span></span>
<span><span>        height:0;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/style&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;div class={className} class:outerstylewidth class:outerstyleheight bind:this={_autoSizer}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Step 2 - ref -&gt; bind: I use the The <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/bind-this"><code><code>bind:this</code></code> directive</a> as an exchange for the <code><code>ref</code></code>-logic. Note that this makes the <code><code>_setRef</code></code> member function unecessary.
    </p>

<p>Step 3 - make render code reactive: The logic part of the <code><code>render</code></code> function is marked as reactive, since it is called each time something changes:

    </pre>
<h4 id="Types">Types
    </h4>

<p>Typescript declarations make the life of the consumer of the library easier. The types of the React library are stored within the definitelyTyped project <code><code>@types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code>.
    </p>
<p>The React component is changed into a Svelte component:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// @types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.d.ts</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>react</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>

    </pre>
<p>To:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.d.ts</span></span>

    </pre>
<h4 id="Howtouseit">How to use it
    </h4>

<p>That's it, the library is ported. You can load the library with
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm install --save-dev svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>This is how you would use the original in React:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;AutoSizer&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    {(height,width)=&gt;(</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;div style={{!width!}}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      Test</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;/div&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    )}</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/AutoSizer&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and here is the equivalent in Svelte, using the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/slot-props"><code><code>let:</code></code> directive</a>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;AutoSizer let:width={childWidth} let:height={childHeight}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;div style={"width:"+childWidth+"px;height:"…</span></span></code></p></pre></div></div>

    </span></p><p>One of my favourite programming languages in the last few years has been <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>. While the language has not yet reached its 1.0 version, it has been widely used in production and has a growing ecosystem. Crystal provides an easy setup and allows you to jump straight into developing your own Crystal programs. I’m going to walk you through getting it setup and how you can get started!</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">puts "Hello World"</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>Crystal is a general purpose, Ruby-inspired compiled programming language, making it extremely fast and easy to program with. The syntax is strongly inspired by Ruby, but also provides static typechecking. Crystal sits somewhere in the top 100 programming languages according to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a>, not widely used but don’t let that put you off!</p><p>I was originally interested in Crystal due to its expressive syntax and the claims on its speed. I am likely in the minority in that I came into Crystal with no prior Ruby experience. Crystal soon became my go-to language for personal programming projects. My project <a href="https://github.com/azula-lang/azula">Azula</a> (WIP programming language) was built entirely in Crystal - a choice a made due to Crystal’s nice macro system and built-in LLVM bindings. Crystal was an excellent choice, allowing rapid development and producing a small binary (1.9mb in Crystal vs 3mb in Go).</p><h3>Shards</h3><p>The Crystal ecosystem is powered by its Shard system. Shards is Crystal’s dependency manager that is usually installed along with Crystal. It aims to allow reproducible installs across platforms by declaring dependencies and their versions. You can read more about Shards <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/the_shards_command/index.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Installing Crystal</h2><p>On Ubuntu, installing Crystal is as easy as running:</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ curl -fsSL https://crystal-lang.org/install.sh | sudo bash</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>For other platforms, have a look at the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/install/">Crystal install guide</a>!</p><h2>First Crystal Program</h2><p>Crystal provides a nice scaffolding tool to setup a new project, including a README template, license and gitignore.</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ crystal init app myproject</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>If we open up <code>myproject/src/myproject.cr</code>, we can start writing our Crystal program!</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">def say(message : String)
    puts message
end

say "Hello!"</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>In this example, we create a function called <code>say</code> that accepts a string and passes it to <code>puts</code>. As you can see, almost identical to Ruby except for the typing of the parameter in the function.</p><h2>Project Structure</h2><h3>src</h3><p>Inside the <code>src/</code> directory is where all the Crystal files will go. It can contain subdirectories, allowing you to divide up your code. You can include separate files by using the <code>require</code> keyword.</p><h3>spec</h3><p>The <code>spec/</code> directory is the home for your tests. Using the <code>crystal spec</code> subcommand, we can run all our tests.</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">it "works" do
    i = 5 + 10
    i.should eq 15
end</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><h3>shard.yml</h3><p><code>shard.yml</code> is used to define our project. In here, we define the name, version, authors, Crystal version, licence &amp; dependencies.</p><deckgo-highlight-code yaml="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">name: myproject
version: 0.1.0

authors:
  - OisinA

targets:
  myproject:
    main: src/myproject.cr

crystal: 0.36.1

license: MIT</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><h2>Building &amp; Running</h2><h3>Running</h3><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ crystal run src/myproject.cr
Hello!</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>Running your Crystal project is as simple as running <code>crystal run [file]</code>.</p><h3>Building</h3><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ crystal build src/myproject.cr
$ ./myproject
Hello!</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>To build your project, you use <code>crystal build [file]</code> producing an executable. You can optionally use the <code>--release</code> optimising the executable. This flag will significantly increase the build time but the produced binary should be smaller and faster.</p><p>Crystal’s build times are reasonable. Compiling my project <a href="https://github.com/azula-lang/azula">Azula</a> takes ~16s with the release flag. Compiling our barebones project above takes ~8s.</p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Simple Web Server</h3><p>In this example, I am using <a href="https://github.com/kemalcr/kemal">Kemal</a>, a HTTP framework for Crystal, to set up a really simple web server to return some JSON on a request. Kemal makes it really easy to quickly write a web application and has built-in JSON support, static file serving and templating. Kemal is installed using Crystal Shards, adding it to the <code>shards.yml</code>.</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">require "kemal"
require "json"

get "/" do |env|
    env.response.content_type = "application/json"
    {name: "Oisin", time: Time.local}.to_json
end

Kemal.run</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>Running this will start up a HTTP server on port 3000, returning JSON containing name and the current time.</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ curl http://localhost:3000
{"name":"Oisin","time":"2021-02-21T18:07:46+00:00"}</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>It’s as simple as that!</p><h2>The Future of Crystal</h2><p>With Crystal being in a nice place at the moment - what are the next steps? The next step for Crystal is to reach a 1.0 release. This version of Crystal will be completely stable and fully ready for production. The Crystal team are currently working towards this goal currently. While there is no timeline in place, its an exciting prospect! I am excited for the future of Crystal and hope to see it more widely used.</p><h2>Resources</h2><p>If you’ve enjoyed this blog post, you might be interested in reading more about Crystal and its ecosystem.

series, I give an accelerated introduction to game development in Unity.
<a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">Subscribers</a> have been following this series over the
past few months, often suggesting areas to cover or elaborate on. A few months
ago, a reader<!-- -->—<!-- -->also a software engineer<!-- -->—<!-- -->reached out to me (lightly
edited, emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>The biggest unknown for me is: How do I start?</strong> What does the process of
creating a game look like? Should I build the scenes first? Should I design
the gameplay mechanics first? With business software, it’s much more familiar.
It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>While there is no single correct answer, we can still make some distinctions
that can help get us oriented. The answer will also undoubtedly depend on <em>who</em>
is doing the development: an individual, small indie team, or larger studio? If
an individual, the answer will also depend on their primary skillset: a
developer, artist, or designer?</p><p>Here, I’ll give heuristics especially helpful for individual Software Engineers
building a game on their own as a side project, hobby, or proof-of-concept.</p><figure><p><span>

Do you have a sense of what game mechanics
your game will have? Do you know what genre, controls, and themes this game will
have?</p><p>If <em>yes</em>, you’re ready to decide <strong><a href="#start-coding">where to start coding</a></strong>.
Otherwise, you have a few more questions to ask yourself.</p><h3>Do you <em>want</em> to know what you’re building?</h3><p>It’s totally fine not to have a project in mind! Maybe you’re prototyping.
Perhaps you’re throwing a bunch of mini-games on the wall and seeing what
sticks. Or you’re looking for inspiration and trying to implement random
mechanics to see what feels fun.</p><p><strong>If you’re hoping to begin working on a specific, cohesive game</strong>, you will
likely want to know what you’re building. Consider brainstorming and sketching
out an informal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document">game design document</a>.
There are
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=game+design+document+template">plenty of templates</a>
of various levels of detail you could decide to use. Especially as a software
engineer toying with abstract ideas in my brain, I’ll start with a super
high-level GDD, covering the feel, themes, genre, and mechanics of the game I
have in mind. Maybe a few pictures or sketches for inspiration, and that’s it.
The key part of this exercise will be the list of mechanics I’m working on.</p><p><strong>If you want to prototype and experiment</strong>, you should already have a vague
sense of 1-2 mechanics that could be fun: Maybe unusual movement or a different
control scheme. It could be a traditional mechanic that you’re wondering how to
implement. For instance, I might decide to build a 3rd Person character and
camera controller to see the “feel” of it, experiment with it a tiny bit, and do
something smooth and polish that I feel good about. I might end up keeping that
code in my back pocket for later, or I might use play-through sessions with that
controller to move around a scene, add a few assets, and use that as a starting
place to see the “feel” various mechanics and designs.</p><h2 id="start-coding">I know the mechanics I care about. Now what?</h2><figure><p><span>

development. You do that by failing fast and getting feedback early. In game
development, the primary metric for success is a feeling: the game should be
fun. So, when deciding what to start with when working on a game, one good
question to ask is: <em>“How can I see if this game is fun as soon as possible?”</em>
or <em>“How can I implement the ‘fun’ part of the game ASAP?”</em></p><p>One way to do that is to look at a game’s mechanics and implement them in some
order. The advice that resonates with me is implementing game mechanics in order
of what the most <em>“core”</em> mechanic first.</p><figure><p><span>

plane shooting game—as an example. Here’s my attempt at writing its main
mechanics in descending order of importance:</p><ol><li>Movement: Navigate a vertically scrolling world</li><li>Obstacles &amp; Dodging: Player can collide with stationary obstacles and debris</li><li>Shooting: Player can shoot straight ahead to defeat obstacles</li><li>Enemies: Enemies are moving obstacles that can shoot back</li><li>Player Health: A player can take a finite number of hits before losing the
game</li><li>Enemy Health: Some enemies take multiple shots to destroy</li><li>Boosts: The player can pick up boosts that improve health, shooting, etc.</li></ol><p>… and so on.</p><p>If I’m trying to develop <em>1945</em> from scratch, I will implement that list in that
order. The game’s mechanics build on each other, so I can only tell if shooting
is “fun” is if I can move around the screen and if there are obstacles I’m
trying to clear (otherwise, there’s no urgency to just pressing <em>Space</em> and
seeing projectiles coming out of a plane).</p><p>In simpler games, we might order our mechanics so that every new feature adds to
a game’s feel. So, with every new mechanic you add, you can play the game and
tell if it’s adding what you hope for it to add.</p><p>In more complex games, some of the “core” mechanics might be too ‘standard’ to
be “risky” <em>per se</em>, but you’ll still need the core mechanics implemented to
assess how fun the other mechanics are. You might choose to use a simpler
throwaway implementation, like a few lines of input-handling code and Unity’s
<code>CharacterController</code> component. You’ll want your core mechanics just smooth
enough that they don’t ruin the fun of the things you’ll layer on top of it.
Another approach here is to use the asset store. I’ve previously mentioned the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-106748?aid=1011leWs6">Ultimate FPS (UFPS)</a>
asset, which you might choose to use when building an FPS game, and move on to
implementing the combat or some more unique (but still “core” feature of the
gameplay first).</p><h2>So I picked a mechanic, but where do I start programming <em>within</em> this mechanic?</h2><p><em>Within</em> a mechanic, your traditional software engineering intuition becomes
helpful. I hope to spend subsequent articles discussing patterns that are
especially helpful in Unity, but here are a few to consider:</p><ul><li>Work within Unity’s Object-Component paradigm. If you’re adding a new
<em>capability</em> to your player, write it as its own component.</li><li><em>Tuning</em> is especially important in game development; representing a
mechanic’s interesting pieces as <em>configurable</em>, <em>serializable</em> data that
can be input to a component will help you playtest and iterate.</li><li>Don’t shy away from using plain-old data objects to represent core concepts
you’re working with. E.g., health, ammo information, or powerups. Make it
serializable if you want it passed around in the editor (or saved to disk
across sessions).</li><li>Where pieces of a concept don’t correspond to a single object in a scene,
consider using Scriptable Objects to do the jobs. Scriptable Objects
introduce many patterns that might help represent what you’re doing.</li></ul><p>A few articles I have already written might prove helpful:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts/">Basic Concepts in Unity for Software Engineers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices/">6 Software Practices to Keep, Shed, and Adopt in Unity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/09/patterns-in-unity-adventure-tutorial/">Making Sense of Patterns in Unity’s Adventure Game Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt5-object-component/">Understanding Unity Engine Objects</a></li></ul><p>You might also take a look at patterns covered in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">Three ways to architect your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,

data and abstractions, the reader’s initial comment also becomes the answer:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond learning about useful patterns and abstractions in game development to
make development clearer and cleaner, the real takeaway is to decide <em>what</em> to
work on at a macro-level.</p><h2>How much time should I spend on one mechanic?</h2><p>As you’re developing a mechanic, what’s a good signal you should move on to the
next on your list? Generally, that would be when you’re convinced:</p><ul><li>This mechanic <em>feels fun</em> and <em>adds to the game</em>,</li><li>Your implementation adds <em>just the
<a href="https://www.e4developer.com/2018/11/21/having-just-the-right-amount-of-technical-debt/">right amount</a></em>
of technical debt.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, folks will often say to worry about polish at the later stages of
your development. In his GDC 2016 micro-talk <em>“Pizzazz First, Polish Later”</em>,
Lee Perry makes a distinction in this traditional wisdom.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8QAVGeEj-U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Certain levels of pizzazz might give you a better sense of your mechanic and how
fun it feels. A certain amount of polish or pizzazz can also help you see your
game in a new light and motivate you to keep going.
<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design/">Juice</a>
is another form of pizzazz; in certain dull moments of your game design, adding
juice might be a low-cost way to get back into the groove of things.</p><p>I hope the conflicting advice shows there isn’t a silver bullet on what to add
when. Rather—as in traditional software development—this choice is about a
series of trade-offs that depend on the developer, the project, and lots more.</p><h2>Are you developing a game or architecting systems?</h2><p>For some software engineers, we’re often drawn to writing code for systems that
seem <em>interesting</em>. Sometimes, I have a game in mind, but <em>really</em>, I’m
interested in implementing a cool inventory system where <em>everything</em> in the
game is an item. It might not be the core mechanic, but it might be the thing I
want to build.</p><p>It’s important to recognize when you’re not building a game but building a
system. If you just quit your job to be a full-time indie gamedev and have a
year of runway before your run out of cash, it is probably a bad idea to start
building a complex inventory system that you don’t even know you’ll need<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="what-are-xss-vulnerabilities-"><a href="#what-are-xss-vulnerabilities-">What are XSS vulnerabilities?</a></h2><p>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities arise when untrusted data gets interpreted as code in a web context. They usually result from: </p><ol><li>Generating HTML unsafely (parameterizing without encoding correctly).</li><li>Allowing users to edit HTML directly (WYSIWYG editors, for example).</li><li>Allowing users to upload HTML/SVG files and serving those back unsafely.</li><li>Using JavaScript unsafely (passing untrusted data into executable functions/properties).</li><li>Using outdated and vulnerable JavaScript frameworks.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-prevent-xss-vulnerabilities-"><a href="#how-to-prevent-xss-vulnerabilities-">How to prevent XSS vulnerabilities?</a></h2><p>Follow these steps: </p><ol><li>Generate HTML safely using a templating engine, or use a static JavaScript frontend to avoid HTML generation altogether.</li><li>If you display untrusted HTML content on your website, purify it first and contain it in a sandboxed frame.</li><li>Serve all downloads with a proper Content-Disposition header to prevent user-supplied HTML/SVG from being rendered in your origin.</li><li>Don't pass untrusted data into executable JavaScript functions/properties such as <code>eval</code>, <code>innerHTML</code> or <code>href</code>.</li><li>Use well-known components with a good security history and keep them up to date.</li><li>Implement a proper CSP (Content Security Policy).</li></ol><h2 id="what-is-untrusted-data-"><a href="#what-is-untrusted-data-">What is untrusted data?</a></h2><p>Before we begin, let's quickly touch on this point. For the sake of this article, anything that is not controlled by your web application is untrusted data.</p><p>User input is one clear example. But you should also consider any data retrieved from external sources, even your database or API, as potentially dangerous and render it with proper safety measures.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is that if it's not a static resource, then it's untrusted data, at least on some level.</p><h2 id="why-are-xss-vulnerabilities-nasty-"><a href="#why-are-xss-vulnerabilities-nasty-">Why are XSS vulnerabilities nasty?</a></h2><p>There is sometimes a misconception that XSS vulnerabilities are low severity bugs. They are not. The power to execute JavaScript code on a website in other people's browsers is equivalent to logging in to the hosting server and changing the HTML files for the affected users.</p><p>As such, XSS attacks effectively make the attacker logged in as the target user, with the nasty addition of tricking the user into giving some information (such as their password) to the attacker, perhaps downloading and executing malware on the user's workstation.</p><p>And it's not like XSS vulnerabilities only affect individual users. Stored XSS affects everyone who visits the infected page, and reflected XSS can often <a href="">spread like wildfire</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)</a>.</p><h2 id="1--avoid-xss-by-generating-html-safely"><a href="#1--avoid-xss-by-generating-html-safely">1. Avoid XSS by generating HTML safely</a></h2><h3 id="a-simple-example"><a href="#a-simple-example">A simple example</a></h3><p>Here is a PHP script that is vulnerable to XSS: </p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>It is vulnerable because it generates HTML unsafely. The <code>search</code> parameter is not <em>encoded</em> correctly. An attacker can create a link such as the following, which would execute the attacker's JavaScript code on the website when the target opens it: </p><pre><code>https://www.example.com/?search=<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"XSS"</span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Results in HTML like: </p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for: <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"XSS"</span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="the-importance-of-encoding"><a href="#the-importance-of-encoding">The importance of encoding</a></h3><p>So how then can you safely display the value <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;</code> in your HTML? The answer is: HTML entity encoding: </p><pre><code> <span>&amp;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>amp<span>;</span>
 <span>&lt;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>lt<span>;</span>
 <span>&gt;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>gt<span>;</span>
 " <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>quot<span>;</span>
 ' <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>#x27<span>;</span></code></pre><p>PHP has a function called <code>htmlspecialchars</code> that performs this operation. So if we change our script a little bit (This is a horrible legacy approach, but it suffices now for demonstration), the resulting HTML will be safe.</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>Creates: </p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for: <span title="<">&amp;lt;</span>script<span title=">">&amp;gt;</span>alert(<span title="&quot;">&amp;quot;</span>XSS<span title="&quot;">&amp;quot;</span>)<span title="<">&amp;lt;</span>/script<span title=">">&amp;gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="encoding-contexts"><a href="#encoding-contexts">Encoding contexts</a></h3><p>HTML entity encoding is suitable only when you want to put something inside HTML tags or quoted HTML attributes. If your variables go inside JavaScript variables or URL addresses, you need another encoding function to avoid XSS.</p><p>So make sure you are using the proper encoding for the context.</p><h3 id="quotes-"><a href="#quotes-">Quotes!</a></h3><p>Don't forget to quote your HTML attributes and JavaScript variables or no encoding in the world will save you. The following PHP script <em>is</em> vulnerable to XSS because you can enter a value such as: <code>foo onClick=alert(1)</code>.</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>'&lt;input type="text" value='</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>'&gt;&lt;/input&gt;'</span><span>;</span></code></pre><h3 id="don-t-put-untrusted-data-in-executable-fields"><a href="#don-t-put-untrusted-data-in-executable-fields">Don't put untrusted data in executable fields</a></h3><p>Also, never put untrusted data, encoded or not, within HTML attributes that execute something. These include <code>onClick</code>, <code>onMouseEnter</code> and friends, but also <code>src</code> and <code>href</code> because someone can put <code>javascript:alert("XSS")</code> for the value, and once again, you have an XSS vulnerability.</p><h3 id="scary--isn-t-it--but-don-t-worry-"><a href="#scary--isn-t-it--but-don-t-worry-">Scary, isn't it? But don't worry.</a></h3><p>There are quite a few things that can go wrong, and OWASP has curated a nice list of them here: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank">Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet</a></p><p>However, I wouldn't advise you to focus on that too much. After all, are we thrilled with code like this?</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>No. That isn't very good. Mixing presentation and code is so 90's.</p><pre><code>$ <span>rm</span> legacy.php</code></pre><h3 id="template-engines-to-the-rescue"><a href="#template-engines-to-the-rescue">Template engines to the rescue</a></h3><p>Instead, you should have your controller method somewhere render a template with the data you want to display. In the case of PHP, Twig is a good option. You would have <code>search.html.twig</code> with the following content: </p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for:</span> <span><span><span>{{</span></span><span>search</span><span><span>}}</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>And Twig would automatically encode your <code>search</code> parameter due to the template engine's automatic escaping.</p><ul><li><a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#output-escaping" target="_blank">https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#output-escaping</a></li></ul><p>There are good template engines for all programming languages worth their salt. There's Jinja for Python, Thymeleaf for Java, and so on.</p><p>Just note that not all template engines are created equal. Some of them have an excellent and standard way to add HTML attributes, Thymeleaf's <code>th:attr</code> being one of them.</p><p>Then there are others where you have to be careful to quote your attributes.</p><p>And probably none of them will protect you from putting untrusted data into <code>href</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>onclick</code>, etc., so you still have to keep those in mind.</p><h3 id="---or-just-don-t-generate-html-at-all-"><a href="#---or-just-don-t-generate-html-at-all-">...or just don't generate HTML at all!</a></h3><p>Another great way not to deal with XSS when generating HTML is not to generate HTML. You can do this by creating a static HTML/JavaScript frontend and perhaps a backend API. Try <a href="https://www.appsecmonkey.com/blog/xss-attack-and-prevention/NextJS" target="_blank">https://nextjs.org/</a>, perhaps. It's pretty cool!</p><h2 id="2--avoid-xss-by-purifying-and-sandboxing-untrusted-content"><a href="#2--avoid-xss-by-purifying-and-sandboxing-untrusted-content">2. Avoid XSS by purifying and sandboxing untrusted content</a></h2><p>There are scenarios where you might want to render content that you don't fully trust. Maybe you want your users to create HTML in a WYSIWYG editor, or perhaps you want to download an HTML response from a third party and display it to the user.</p><p>Whatever the use case, the solution is the same. Purify and sandbox.</p><h3 id="purify"><a href="#purify">Purify</a></h3><p>Purifying is the act of removing any dangerous parts from an HTML string. You can do this on the client-side with <code>DOMPurify</code> or on the server-side with several tools such as the OWASP <code>Java HTML sanitizer</code> for Java or Mozzila's <code>bleach</code> for Python. Just pick a well-esteemed one.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify" target="_blank">https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify</a></li><li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/" target="_blank">https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach" target="_blank">https://github.com/mozilla/bleach</a></li></ul><h3 id="sandbox"><a href="#sandbox">Sandbox</a></h3><p>Purifying is an excellent first step, but I wouldn't leave my website's security hanging on that alone. Luckily, there is a great control that we can use to display untrusted HTML content. May I present: sandboxed iframes!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp</a></li></ul><p>Sandboxed iframes run by default in their own <em>origin</em>. That is, if anything goes south in the frame, the frame cannot access your website. Also, sandboxed iframes by default prevent script execution and even links. Very useful for our purposes!</p><p>Here is an example of a non-sandboxed frame. If you run it, you should see an <code>alert</code> box with the message <em>evilness</em>.</p><p>Here is another fiddle with the <code>sandbox</code> attribute specified. Notice that this time the script does not get executed.</p><p>Such is the magic of sandboxed frames.</p><h2 id="3--avoid-xss-by-serving-downloads-properly"><a href="#3--avoid-xss-by-serving-downloads-properly">3. Avoid XSS by serving downloads properly</a></h2><p>When you allow users to upload files, there is a risk that they upload a malicious HTML, SVG, or similar file to your server. And suppose the file is then downloadable from your domain, and your web server serves it like any other HTML file. An attacker could upload a file with malicious JavaScript content and redirect unwitting users to the page.</p><p>To prevent this, serve all content that is not supposed to be rendered directly in a web browser with a proper <code>Content-Disposition</code> header. Like so: </p><pre><code><span>Content-Disposition</span><span>:</span> attachment; filename="filename.jpg"</code></pre><p>By specifying <code>attachment</code>, you tell browsers to show the save file dialog.</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition</a></li></ul><h2 id="4--avoid-xss-by-using-javascript-safely"><a href="#4--avoid-xss-by-using-javascript-safely">4. Avoid XSS by using JavaScript safely</a></h2><p>Not all XSS vulnerabilities arise from unsafe HTML. Sometimes your JavaScript code can have XSS vulnerabilities in it.</p><p>To get one, all you have to do is pass untrusted data into a function or property that either executes something or changes the HTML, HREF, or SRC of something.</p><p>Here are a couple of examples just so that you get the idea.</p><ol><li>Passing untrusted data to jQuery <code>append</code> (which writes HTML).</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Passing untrusted data to a <code>href</code> attribute. This example demonstrates that not even React applications are safe from XSS if you don't know what you are doing (click the user's homepage link to see).</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Passing untrusted data to <code>eval</code> This is an example of passing untrusted data to a function that executes something. This simple calculator will execute code if you enter values like <code>;alert('xss');</code> into one of the operands.</li></ol><p>There is virtually an infinite list of functions and properties into which you shouldn't pass untrusted data. They include things like <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code>, <code>setTimeout</code> and so on. And of course, the JavaScript libraries you use will have their own, just like the jQuery example above.</p><p>It's better to be safe than sorry, so check the documentation for the function/property before assigning/appending untrusted data into it.</p><h2 id="5--avoid-xss-by-using-well-known-javascript-libraries-and-keeping-them-up-to-date"><a href="#5--avoid-xss-by-using-well-known-javascript-libraries-and-keeping-them-up-to-date">5.

    <p>If you’re creating technical content in order to teach others, you might be tempted to use words like “easy”, “simple”, or “straightforward” because you want to put the learner at ease. Unfortunately, those words can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>How “easy” something is depends on the learner’s frame of reference. It’s relative to their existing experiences. When a learner encounters something that they hear is easy, or simple, or straightforward, and they encounter a problem, they tend to internalize it; “This is easy… why am I struggling? I’m not cut out for this!” This cancels out all the good intentions you had.</p>
<p>When I’m editing a document, article, book, or script, I have a list of words and phrases that I try to eliminate right away. I call them “bad words”. Here are some of the words that tend to be demotivational.</p>
<ul>
<li>basically</li>
<li>easy</li>
<li>just</li>
<li>obvious</li>
<li>obviously</li>
<li>straightforward</li>
<li>simple</li>
<li>simply</li>
</ul>
<p>I flag these and remove them, as in most cases they’re not necessary. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply reboot the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remove “Simply” and the sentence loses no meaning and becomes tighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reboot the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I’ll ask the author to add the context that might be missing. A lot of times, authors are making assumptions about the experience the readers have. Consider this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Okta is a simple way to add authentication to your app. Just add it to your project. Much easier than writing your own authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the documentation for Okta, it’s anything but simple. And you don’t “just” add it to your project. You need an account. You need to create users. You need to import the appropriate libraries, and integrate the code into your codebase.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this a hundred times, you may indeed find this easy. As an author, you have to remember that you’re writing something like this to teach others. You want them to be successful. So you may have to share the details so the learner has the right frame of reference, and can make the call if it’s “easy” for themselves. Consider this version instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okta lets you add authentication to your app instead of writing your own logic, which will be more complicated and more prone to security vulnerabilities. In this tutorial you’ll sign up for an Okta account, obtain the API keys you need, create your users, and integrate Okta’s JavaScript code with your app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This version tells the reader what’s in store, including an explanation as to why Okta is a good choice over writing your own implementation.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s much more text. But readers can skip it. Assume your readers are as smart as you. Give them all the pieces and let them decide what’s easy, and what they can skip.</p>
<p>I suggest adding words like “easy”, “simple”, and others to your text editor’s spelling dictionary as misspelled words so they show up as you’re writing or editing.</p>
<p>You can also install plugins for your editor that focus on improving writing. The <a href="https://github.com/TravisTheTechie/vscode-write-good">write-good</a> plugin for Visual Studio Code is handy, and you can find similar plugins for <a href="https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/writegood.vim">Vim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode">Emacs</a>. These will find some of the words I listed, among other phrases and words that cause your writing to be weaker than it could be. Be warned though; these plugins have opinions of their own, and may ignore some words while flagging others. Tweak them to find what works best for your learners. After all, you’re writing for them, not just for yourself.</p>

             <h2>-1. Overview</h2>
<p> After the prototyping phase of any electronics project, I like to make a "Motherboard" PCB. For this phase I will continue to use breakout boards for all of the individual components, but link them together using a PCB. This allows the PCB design to stay simple and flexible, and makes them easy to hand manufacture them in my workshop. This is a great setup if you want to do a small (10ish) beta run of your project before designing a full product. I have shipped many hardware products using this stage, it's a great way to validate your MVP before putting money into tooling and CM bring up. </p> <p> This tutorial will walk through the process that I follow to create a motherboard. The intended audience is someone who has already wired up a prototype on a breadboard, and wants to get started bundling them together into a motherboard. This will be the guide I wish existed when I got started doing this. </p>
 <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4018eef6e0333515d064a35fe2336c2858a216c3/83757/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/thermostat-motherboard.jpeg"></p><p>Here is an example of the motherboard I designed for my <a href="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/caffstat_beta">Thermostat</a> project </p>
<p> This is just the process I figured out for myself, it's by no means perfect. If you have any feedback or questions about any of this stuff, want a PCB design for your project, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me: mdl0394@gmail.com </p>
<p> This is Part 1 of the guide. In this guide we will go through initial setup, component model sourcing and schematic design. In Part 2 we will go through board layout and ordering PCBs. If you want to be notified when Part 2 comes out, sign up for email notifications, or subscribe to the RSS feed. </p>

        <h2 id="0-before-you-build-a-pcb">0. Before you build a PCB</h2>

<p>Before you build a PCB you should already have all of the breakout boards &amp; devkits you want to use for the project. When designing the motherboard you should already have a good understanding of how the electronics components are wired together, if you donâ€™t itâ€™s easy to make costly mistakes.</p>

<p>For this project I will be using my Caffstat (Hackable Smart Home Thermostat) project. If you are interested in a smart home thermostat feel free to check out that <a href="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/caffstat_beta">project here</a>.</p>

<p>These 3 images represent the stages of any electronics project: Breadboard -&gt; Project Board -&gt; PCB</p>

<p>This project contains 3 different breakout boards and a few through hole components. The brains of the operation are an ESP32 Devkit, there are breakouts for the Thermostat and Screen, and through hold components for the buttons, resistors, and relays.</p>

<h3 id="01-installing-eagle">0.1 Installing Eagle</h3>

<p>For this tutorial I will we be using Eagle. Itâ€™s got a free tier tool that, and it integrates well into the Autodesk suite. Eagle is free for up to two layer boards, which should be all you need for most electronics projects. The information here will be pretty generally applicable to any tool, although the screenshots will be of eagle specifically.</p>

<p>You can download eagle for free <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">here</a></p>

<h2 id="1-anatomy-of-a-pcb-design">1. Anatomy of a PCB Design</h2>

<p>A PCB Design contains two main parts, the schematic and the layout. The schematic is an abstract diagram of the connections between components in your project, and the layout is the actual physical layout of those components, and the electrical traces that connect them. The great thing about PCB design software, is that the schematic will be enforced when you are creating the layout, this makes it very straight forward to create the layout after youâ€™ve created the schematic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%203.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%203.png"></p>

<p>This is the completed schematic for the caffstat project. You can see all of the breakout boards as individual components (red). The connections between them are mostly being managed by net labels to simplify the schematic (more on this later).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%204.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%204.png"></p>

<p>Here is an image of the completed layout. Every component has found a space on the board, and all of the electrical traces have been drawn. Donâ€™t worry if it looks complicated/messy now, when we go step by step it will be very easy to create.</p>

<h2 id="2-finding-or-creating-component-models">2. Finding or Creating Component Models</h2>

<p>Before you can begin drawing a schematic and layout, you need to find or create models for each and every one of your components. A device model contains both a <strong>symbol</strong> for part (goes in the schematic) and a <strong>footprint</strong> of the part (for the layout). I will list out some great resources for finding or creating these here. I can create a full tutorial for creating your own component models if you are interested, let me know at mdl0394@gmail.com</p>

<p>One thing to note is that Eagle comes pre-packaged with a bunch of common components. These are mostly things like standard resistors/capacitors. Itâ€™s worth checking the pre-installed library before spending too much time scouring the internet. The easiest way to check the library is to use the â€œAdd Partâ€� button discussed in section 3.2 of this tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="21-octopart">2.1. Octopart</h3>

<p>The best tool I have found for looking up components and downloading models is <a href="https://octopart.com/">Octopart</a>. Their mission is to provide the best search engine for electronics components. Almost every part can be found in the search engine, I always check here first.</p>

<p>If octopart has the CAD Model for your part, it will appear like this, you want to download the Eagle format, this will download the library that you can install later.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%205.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%205.png"></p>

<h3 id="22-desparate-googling">2.2. Desparate Googling</h3>

<p>I have also found quite a few schematics by just googling the part. It can often be helpful to try different variations on the name, and include the term â€œEagleâ€� or â€œ.lbrâ€� (Eagle library file extension) in your query. If you do find a schematic, make sure you do some measurements (you can do this on the layout of your design) to ensure it matches well with your part (sometimes people upload bad designs, or are modeling something slightly different than yours, you donâ€™t want to order a PCB with bad footprints)</p>

<h3 id="23-installing-a-library">2.3. Installing a library</h3>

<p>Once you have a library itâ€™s easy to install, drag the Library (.lbr) file into the <code>libraries</code> section of the Eagle Control Panel. <strong>Important:</strong> after dragging the lbr file, make sure you right click and hit â€œUseâ€� otherwise you wonâ€™t actually be able to add it to your project. Libraries in use will have a green dot next to them</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%206.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%206.png"></p>

<h3 id="24-creating-your-own-library">2.4. Creating your own Library</h3>

<p>If you fail to find any schematics online (often the case with cheap breakout boards, or with chinese knockoffs) you might have to make your own. Itâ€™s not too hard to make your own models, mostly just a little bit tedious. Creating your own models &amp; libraries is a full tutorial in itself, if I get interest I can put that together, for now I will refer you to the resources I used to learn the process.</p>

<p>A good tutorial on how to make custom eagle components can be found here: <a href="https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-components/">https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-components/</a></p>

<h2 id="3-creating-your-schematic">3. Creating your Schematic</h2>

<p>Once you have your components, you can start creating your schematic.</p>

<h3 id="31-basic-project-setup">3.1. Basic Project Setup</h3>

<p>First thing is to make a new Project and new Schematic in eagle. Go into the projects section, right click and hit â€œNew Projectâ€�. Then right click and hit â€œNew Schematicâ€�. Once the schematic opens, you also want to create a layout (Weâ€™ll use this in Step 4). Do this by hitting the â€œGenerate/Switch to Boardâ€� button on the top bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6647e677a7889893fc65d08499400076efd2adee/d3801/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/screen_shot_2021-01-18_at_9.26.13_am.png" alt="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6647e677a7889893fc65d08499400076efd2adee/d3801/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/screen_shot_2021-01-18_at_9.26.13_am.png"></p>

<h3 id="32-place-your-components">3.2. Place your components</h3>

<p>Once you have a schematic you need to put all of your part symbols on. The add part button is on the left bar, clicking this will bring up a dialogue that lets you choose a component. If you donâ€™t see a component you installed here, go back to the control panel and make sure you selected â€œUseâ€� on the right click menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%207.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%207.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%208.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%208.png"></p>

<p>Add all of your components to your schematic. Make sure you give yourself a bunch of room around components to create connections. You should also try to sort the parts in logical groupings, the simpler your schematic, the less likely-hood of bugs.</p>

<p>While placing components there are a few useful tools at your disposal. The Move, Rotate and Copy tools at the top of the left panel are all useful for organizing your schematic. When you want to select an object, the easiest thing to do is to click the + symbol (probably either at the center, or the origin of the part).</p>

<p>Here is what my schematic looks like after I have placed all of my parts.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%209.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%209.png"></p>

<h3 id="33-placing-the-ground-label">3.3. Placing the Ground Label</h3>

<p>The standard for schematics is to use a specialty component to label the shared ground. You can find this by searching â€œgndâ€� in the Add Part menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2010.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2010.png"></p>

<p>I will usually place one of these per component, just off the bottom of the component, and wire them to the ground pin.</p>

<h2 id="34-wiring-using-labels">3.4. Wiring using Labels</h2>

<p>You can directly connect parts together using the â€œNetâ€� tool (Green line) however with more than a few parts, this will very quickly become unmanageable. Instead of doing that, I will show you how to use labels to cleanly connect parts together. Note that for some components I will not use labels for connections, this makes sense for analog circuits, or things like pull down resistors because they can be logically grouped together.</p>

<p>For every node that I want to connect, I will first draw a one or two unit Net. Like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2011.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2011.png"></p>

<p>Then using the â€œNameâ€� tool I will name all of the new nets something that makes them easier to keep track of. To name a net, select the tool, then select the green line for the net, a text dialogue should …</p></div></div></div>

When a domain is configured to receive mails usually a DNS record of the type MX is configured pointing to the host name of the mail server.</p><p>

Notably, according to the respective <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> the MX record must contain a domain name and may not directly point to an IP address. However some mail servers do configure an IP address. Many mail servers are lenient when it comes to this misconfiguration and will deliver mails nevertheless, so this may stay undetected.</p><p>

I happen to use a mail server that is less forgiving (Courier), and every now and then I cannot send a mail due to this. It’s rare, but it does happen. If your mail server has such a configuration you may not receive some legitimate e-mails.</p><p>

So I’m hoping to raise some awareness and get some of those servers fixed.</p><ul><li>Obviously if you run a mail and DNS server please don’t do this and correctly set your MX records.</li><li>If you do any kind of IT service or consulting that is related to mail and DNS servers this is a good thing to add to your list of things to check regularly (here's a <a href="https://github.com/hannob/ipmx">very simple python script you can use</a>).</li><li>If you run any form of service or tool that checks DNS and mail servers for misconfigurations, please add a check for IP addresses in MX records and warn your users.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>The Alice 4 rasterizer is broken into two main parts:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/libgl.html">software library</a> linked with the C application program. The library
                    implements the IrisGL API. It performs transformations, lighting, clipping,
                    and retained mode (display lists). Its output is a list of commands
                    (clear screen, draw triangle, swap buffers, etc.) that it writes to
                    memory outside Linux's range.</li>
                <li>An FPGA configuration that reads these commands from SDRAM and
                    executes them. For triangles it interpolates color (RGB) and depth
                    (Z). The FPGA also scans out the image buffer to the
                    LCD and performs other minor tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Buffers</h2>

            <p>There are three image buffers in shared memory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A front color buffer, which is displayed to the user via the LCD.
                The scanning is continuous because the LCD has no memory of its own.
                The timing and wire format is similar to VGA.</li>
                <li>A back color buffer, which is being rasterized into.</li>
                <li>A depth buffer, used along with the back buffer during rasterization.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first two buffers are only virtually “front” and “back”. Those two
            labels switch every frame as the back buffer becomes the new front
            buffer and is shown to the user.</p>

            <h2>Modules</h2>

            <p>The Verilog code is broken into about a dozen modules:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Main: Integrates all the other modules.
                    <ul>
                        <li>soc_instance: Module generated by Qsys to interface with
                            SDRAM and I<sup>2</sup>C.</li>
                        <li>LCD_control: Generates LCD control signals (H-Sync, V-Sync,
                            pixel enable, next frame signal, X coordinate, Y coordinate).
                            This runs at 25&nbsp;MHz (about 50&nbsp;FPS). It could run faster (up to 40&nbsp;MHz)
                            but the board clock is 50&nbsp;MHz, so it was convenient to
                            divide that by two and avoid having asynchronous clocks.</li>
                        <li>LCD_text: Given screen pixel X and Y, returns character X and Y
                            (text column and row) and sub-character X and Y.</li>
                        <li>LCD_debug: Given character X and Y and three 32-bit debug values,
                            returns which character to draw.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Binary_to_hex: Converts a nybble to a hex
                                    ASCII value. Used for each nybble of the
                                    debug values to generate hex output.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Frame_buffer: Sends the front frame buffer to the LCD.</li>
                        <li>LCD_font: Given ASCII character and sub-character X and Y,
                            returns whether the pixel is on or off.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Font_ROM: The font pixels.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Command_reader: Pre-fetches drawing commands from
                            SDRAM into a FIFO.</li>
                        <li>Rasterizer: Reads drawing commands and executes them.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Read_FIFO: Queues rasterized pixels,
                                    waiting for Z read to complete.</li>
                                <li>Write_FIFO: Queues rasterized and Z-compared
                                    pixels, waiting for pixel writes to complete.
                                    See the “Write FIFO” section below for more details.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Prescaler: Generates a tick every N clocks.</li>
                        <li>PWM: Generates a PWM signal for LCD backlight brightness.</li>
                        <li>Debouncer: Debounces the Home button.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Memory controller</h2>

            <p>The Altera Cyclone V SoC has a wonderful memory controller for accessing
            the synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM). It has a port for the ARM and six ports
            for the FPGA. Each FPGA port can be configured for input or output, and their
            relative priorities (including the ARM port) can be set. The priorities were
            critical for making sure the front-buffer scan-out was never starved of
            pixels. The SDRAM itself ran so fast (400&nbsp;MHz DDR) that all the ports could
            be active and not stall too often. The ports were set up as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reading the front-buffer for LCD scan-out. This was configured
                to be the highest priority.</li>
                <li>Reading the graphics command buffer.</li>
                <li>Reading the depth buffer for the pixel being rasterized.</li>
                <li>Writing the color of the pixel just rasterized.</li>
                <li>Writing the depth of the pixel just rasterized.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All five ports were hooked up to FIFOs to minimize the effects of
            memory latency.</p>

            <h2>Rasterization</h2>

            <p>Rasterization uses the edge-equation technique. The idea is to test every
            pixel to see whether it's inside the triangle. “Inside” is defined as “on the
            same side of every edge”. Only pixels in the bounding box of the triangle are
            tested. This technique wastes at least 50% of its time on pixels outside the
            triangle, but it's simpler to implement than edge-walkers.</p>

            <p>The state machine in <tt>Rasterizer.v</tt> reads commands from SDRAM
            (indirectly through the FIFO) and executes them. Because the SDRAM interface
            is (logically) 64 bits wide, and each pixel takes 32 bits (8 bits each of
            red, green, and blue, with 8 bits wasted), we always rasterize two pixels
            at a time. At 50&nbsp;MHz, that's 100 million pixels per second, but with (at least)
            half of them wasted, that's at most 50 million drawn pixels per second.</p>

            <p>To minimize SDRAM latency stalls, we use three FIFOs in the rasterization
            process:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The Command FIFO queues the drawing commands so that the
                    state machine need not block too long.</li>
                <li>The Read FIFO queues drawn pixels while we wait for the
                    depth read to return. After determining that a pixel is
                    inside the triangle, we initiate a read of its
                    corresponding depth value (if depth-comparison is enabled
                    for this triangle). This can take some time (tens of clocks) and we don't
                    want to block the rasterizer. Instead, we queue up all the
                    information we have about this pixel (depth memory address,
                    depth value, color memory address, and color) and move on to the
                    next pixel.
                    Another module (<tt>Read_FIFO.v</tt>) waits for the SDRAM read
                    to return. Since SDRAM reads return in the order they were
                    made, the module then gets the next item in our FIFO,
                    compares the depth values, and if the new pixel is closer to
                    the camera than the existing pixel, enqueues the same pixel
                    information into the Write FIFO. (All of this is done two
                    pixels at a time.)</li>
                <li>The Write FIFO queues pixels that must be written back to SDRAM.
                    The pixel's color must be written, and optionally the depth value
                    must be written (if enabled for this triangle). This is a complicated
                    module because we must take into account whether there are pixels
                    in the FIFO to write, whether the depth memory controller is ready
                    to accept another write, and whether the color memory controller is
                    ready to accept another write. See the section “Write FIFO” below
                    for details.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's very little stalling in this pipeline, so we end up with a
            rasterization rate of about 50 million Gouraud (color-interpolated)
            Z-buffered pixels per second. The triangle overhead lets us do
            almost 2 million (empty) triangles per second. It's hard to compare
            these numbers to
            <a href="http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/gfxtables.html">real SGI machines</a>, 
            but we seem to be matching the performance of machines built in the
            early 1990s.</p>

            <h2>Reciprocal</h2>

            <p>For each triangle, the rasterizer computes its on-screen area, then takes
            the reciprocal of the area. This is necessary for the normalization of
            the barycentric coordinates used to interpolate color and depth.
            <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/rasterization-stage">Scratchapixel</a> has a great explanation
            of how this works; scroll down to the “Barycentric Coordinates” section.</p>

            <p>To compute the reciprocal we use the built-in
            <a href="https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/ug/ug_lpm_alt_mfug.pdf"><tt>lpm_divide</tt></a> module:</p>

            <pre>lpm_divide
    #(.LPM_WIDTHN(32),
      .LPM_WIDTHD(32),
      .LPM_NREPRESENTATION("UNSIGNED"),
      .LPM_DREPRESENTATION("SIGNED"),
      .LPM_PIPELINE(6)) area_divider(
        .clock(clock),
        .clken(area_reciprocal_enabled),
        .numer(32'h7FFF_FFFF),
        .denom(tri_area),
        .quotient(tri_area_recip_result)
    );
            </pre>

            <p>The module is configured to have six pipeline stages, which means that
            the result will come out six clocks after the denominator was put in.
            We don't pipeline (overlap) our reciprocals (we only need one per triangle), but our
            state machine must wait six clocks for this result. We found the
            number 6 by trying various values until the compiler stopped complaining
            about timing violations.</p>

            <h2>Write FIFO</h2>

            <p>The Write FIFO, which writes pixel data to the back color buffer and
            to the depth buffer, was one of the most difficult modules to write in
            this project. Conceptually the state machine should perform these
            steps in a loop:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Wait for a new pixel to be available in the Write FIFO.</li>
                <li>Write it to the back color buffer and to the depth buffer.</li>
                <li>Wait for both SDRAM controller ports to acknowledge that they had
                    accepted the writes.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Remember that wherever we talk about “a pixel” here, we mean two

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>This year, 2021, is the 50th anniversary of the first single-chip microprocessor's invention, the Intel 4004. The official birthday of the 4004 was November 15th, 1971, when it was announced to the public. There are other pretenders to the throne, but only the 4004 meets all of the key criteria to be considered the first. I offer multiple ways to become a proud owner of a fully-functional, genuine, new Intel 4004 microprocessor.</p>
<p>I offer two ways to acquire an Intel 4004. The first way is that I incorporate an Intel 4004 chip into an artwork, called a ChipScape. These ChipScape artworks have an image of the tiny 4004 chip itself and have technical information about 4004 and its creation story. I offer different styles to appeal to different interests, price points, and artistic tastes. These make great gifts for anyone who has an interest in computer technology.</p>
<p>The second way is&nbsp;that I offer just the chips. Here you have two choices: the Intel P4004 and the Intel D4004. Both types have the same chip on the inside, but their packaging is different. The P4004 is made from a black plastic resin and is the more "common" version available. Within the P4004, I offer different date codes (when this chip was made, the earlier, the more valuable) and different manufacturing locations (where the chip was made, this is purely a collector preference). The D4004 is made using a gray ceramic package. It was made to be more rugged and is much rarer.</p>
<p>I get lots of questions about the C4004. I don't have any of the C4004s available as chips, just in artworks (only a couple). C4004s are made with white ceramic and gold plated leads and caps. They are rare. Prices for&nbsp;good working versions can range from $1,000 to $5,000.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like most who entered college in the mid-aughts, I was taken by Facebook. It had a sleek interface. All my friends from high school and college were on it, being super cool with edgy profile pics. I browsed my newsfeed everyday — probably for years. But, starting the early 2010s, I noticed an inverse correlation. The more friend requests I received from long lost aunties and uncles, the fewer posts I would see from my peers. It was almost like the aunties and uncles were driving them away.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/post-images/facebook-mom.jpg" alt="Facebook friended by mom" src="https://consult.sauvik.me/assets/post-images/facebook-mom.jpg"></p><p>There’s a concept in social psychology known as an illusory correlation <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Illusory correlations are sort of like stereotypes for relationships between two variables — if enough of a certain type of person does activity X or uses thing Y, then other people start to associate activity X or thing Y as being only for that certain type of person. More concretely, if enough aunties and uncles seem to use Facebook (relative to other demographics), then non-aunties-and-uncles start thinking that Facebook must only be for aunties and uncle. At best, the correlation is silly; at worst, it is pernicious. Whatever it is, its effects are often unconscious and real.</p><p>Now, I want you to close your eyes and think about the first person who comes to mind when you think about the attribute “security conscious” or “concerned about privacy”. Readers of this blog may be biased; but, for many non-experts, the person they think about may look something like this:</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FiVHfwLc.gif&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="Printer Hacker"></p><p>And therein lies the illusory correlation in consumer security.</p><p>If you’ll allow me a moment to be more formal: early adopters of security and privacy features are usually those who are especially concerned about security and privacy. Perhaps this is because they genuinely have some sensitive information to keep away from prying eyes. Perhaps they are simply risk averse. Whatever the reason, many non-experts describe these early adopters and security experts more generally as “nutty” or “paranoid”. A classic example of this comes from Shirley Gaw and colleagues study on encrypted email usage in the workplace <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The authors found that if someone used encrypted email but did not have a “good” reason for doing so (e.g., if they were only asking about lunch), they were perceived by their colleagues as being “paranoid.” I found something similar in my own research <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: experts felt hesitant about sharing security advice with non-experts to avoid being perceived as “nutty”. The upshot? If only “nutty” or “paranoid” people use security features, and <em>I</em> am not nutty or paranoid…well, those security or privacy features must not be for me.</p><p>In short, early adopters of security features may —&nbsp;subtly or overtly — be perceived as paranoid by others; in turn, this stigma can cause non-experts to “disaffiliate” from security. This is what I call the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis in end-user security. I call it a hypothesis because it has not been tested it in a randomized, controlled experiment <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>; but, there is a good bit of observational evidence to back it up.</p><p>When I worked at Facebook, for example, I ran an analysis of how one’s friends use of security features like two-factor authentication affected one’s own use of two-factor authentication <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. I found a surprising effect: for the vast majority of people, social influence appeared to have a <em>negative</em> effect on one’s own adoption of two-factor authentication. In other words, for the vast majority of people, the presence of N friends who used two-factor authentication made them less likely to use two-factor authentication than if they had fewer than N friends who used two-factor authentication.</p><p>This is a surprising result. Typically, social “proof” tends to have a positive effect —&nbsp;if more of my friends use X, I should be more likely to use X myself. But, my research suggests that this more “typical” effect of social influence does not come to fruition for typical security tools until many of one’s friends start using security tools (e.g., as demonstrated by the recent WhatsApp exodus to Signal). Social influence for security behaviors is sort of like quantum mechanics in physics: the rules that apply at large scale do not apply at small scale.</p><p>So what can we do? My research suggests that one of the key drivers of the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis is the unfounded assumption that only geeks use security features. This image of the shady security geek is pernicious, and has been amplified by popular depictions of “hackers”. We also happen to live in a culture that values openness and transparency —&nbsp;”I’ve Got Nothing to Hide”, tired as it is as an argument against privacy, is seen as a badge of honor. But this notion of privacy and security being only for shady geeks is dangerous, and does more harm than good.</p><p>There is hope, though. My research suggests that the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis does <em>not</em> hold for security and privacy systems that are designed to be more social: i.e., those that can be easily observed when used, that involve others in the process of providing security, or that allow us to act in benefit of others. By making security and privacy more social, we start to associate security and privacy with more desirable social properties — e.g., altruism, leadership, and responsibility. And if people stop viewing the security conscious as shady geeks, and start viewing them as altruistic leaders, perhaps we can overcome the paranoia-disaffiliation effect.</p><hr><p>Thanks for reading!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2><p>Reaching decentralized consensus is hard. Really, there must be a reason why Bitcoin network is such an energy-inefficient monster with its Proof-of-Work algorithm. Of course, many other consensus algorithms exist that are not that power-hungry, for example, Proof-of-Stake variations. But they require some sort of centralization, usually hidden under details and complexity. And they still have limits, a boundary on the total number of transactions per second that a network can process.</p><p>I don’t believe it’s possible to find an efficient consensus algorithm, which would be truly decentralized. But why restrict ourselves to just software solutions? Here I want to explain that a super-efficient hardware solution exists. And it’s already within the reach of our current technologies.</p><h2 id="2-the-main-problem">2. The Main Problem</h2><p>What is the root cause of why it’s so hard to achieve a decentralized consensus?</p><p>Well, in the case of cryptocurrencies it’s called <em>double spending</em>. If Clara has 100 coins at some point in time then she can’t spend 200 coins – the network will just ignore such transaction as incorrect. But transferring 100 coins to Alice or 100 coins to Bob are both correct transactions. Yet they are conflicting. If Clara simultaneously commits both these transactions then the network has to decide what to choose as the right one and what to discard.</p><p>Making a decision based on time is not a deterministic way, because some participants can receive one of the conflicting transactions earlier in time, while the others will see a different order.</p><p>Somehow the whole network, i.e. every participant of it, has to decide what to pick as the correct transaction in a way, that will be in agreement with the decisions of every other participant.</p><p>This decision can’t be based on some mathematical function of a transaction (if Clara has enough freedom of composing it). For example, we can’t have a rule where we pick the transaction of 100 coins to Alice as correct because <em>A &lt; B</em>. Because if Clara commits another conflicting transaction of 100 coins to Aaron later in time, then the whole network would have to change its decisions.</p><p>Note that the same problem exists in a broader context, not related to currencies. For example, you can have a blockchain network where users can play chess games. At any moment in time a player has a set of allowable moves. But a player is allowed to choose only one move. If he commits two moves simultaneously, then, again, the network has to decide what to pick as the right one.</p><p>There are many consensus algorithms invented, but they are just ways to centralize a network, where these conflict resolution decisions are made by some selected (or elected) set of participants. In fact, Bitcoin PoW consensus algorithm is a form of election of a participant (miner), whose decision will be set as correct for the whole network.</p><hr><p>So, how can we use hardware to solve this problem?</p><p>Imagine hypothetical hardware that additionally signs Clara’s transactions (via some cryptographic microchips). Moreover, this hardware keeps a counter of Clara’s transactions and <em>attaches</em> this number to a signed transaction. So, the network will see a transaction with its number that has two signatures – the one by Clara’s private key and another one by hardware private key.</p><p>Conflict resolution is trivial in this case. The network will accept a transaction that has a lower counter (it has to be +1 of the previous transaction number).</p><p>The main assumption that we need for network security is that Clara can’t tamper hardware or simulate it in some way. Of course, making tamper-proof hardware is also a hard task, but the technology is almost there. There are a lot of tamper-resistant USB keys that are already on the market.</p><p>Actually, FIDO keys are already satisfying our blockchain needs!</p><h2 id="3-fido-keys">3. FIDO keys</h2><p>FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is an alliance of the world’s major IT companies. They developed U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) – an open standard of two-factor authentification that uses USB or NFC keys. Luckily, this standard is indeed universal. Even though it was developed as an addition to password authentification in centralized services, we can use it in a blockchain network instead!</p><p>A nice overview of U2F protocol you can see <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html">here</a>.</p><p>In particular, look at this diagram</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/auth_flow4.svg" alt="Mobile View"><em>https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html</em></p><p>It is supposed that a Relying Party (server) starts second-factor authentification by sending a <em>challenge</em> to a client. But blockchain network has no servers. Instead of a challenge, Clara uses the hash of her transaction, where <em>app_id</em> is just a name of the blockchain network and <em>handle</em> is Clara’s personal public key. Then the U2F device will update the counter and return the signed transaction with the attached counter. This is exactly what we need! Clara then sends this information along with the actual transaction and her own signature to the network.</p><p>To ensure that Clara can’t simulate the device, U2F protocol additionally includes the attestation certificate of the device manufacturer, as explained <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-technotes-the-truth-about-attestation/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="4-typical-usage-scenario">4. Typical usage scenario</h2><p>First of all, a user has to register in the network. To do this, he needs to have FIDO hardware key and to generate his personal private/public keys. The registration is essentially linking personal keys with device keys. For this, an empty challenge can be used in the device signing flow.</p><p>Making transactions was described in the previous section.</p><p>If the device is lost/broken/stolen then the user can register another device with its personal key. Though, in this case, the network should wait for some time, for example, 24 hours, to be sure that the previous device (in a couple with the personal key) is not used anymore.</p><h2 id="5-threats">5. Threats</h2><p>Since every transaction must have two signatures – by device and user, the device alone can’t be used to harm its user.</p><p>But an incorrect or tampered device can be used to submit conflicting transactions to the network (for example, with the same counter). This will split the network if no other consensus algorithm is involved.</p><p>But we can assume that manufacturer has no incentives to make incorrect devices to harm the network.</p><p>So, the only threat is device tampering. Even though modern FIDO keys are tamper-resistant, their security is probably not enough to be used in blockchain networks, because there were no reasons to make them fully tamper-proof in usage with centralized servers. But nearly tamper-proof technology is certainly possible.</p><h2 id="6-super-efficiency">6.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><small>Unsharpen may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.</small></p><div>

                                
                                <p>The Sharpie S-Gel is a relatively new gel pen that was first released in early 2020. Sharpie, being known for its permanent markers, has produced pens for some time, but those have mostly been fiber-tipped, marker-like pens. These pens, which are essentially just thin Sharpie markers, developed a solid following, they were simply an extension of the Sharpie marker’s popularity.</p>
<p>And then came the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/sharpie-s-gel/">S-Gel</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="S-Gels_Origin">S-Gel’s Origin</span></h2>
<p>The S-Gel is one of a huge number of retractable gel pens, so why was it able to come along and gain such popularity? The pen is sold in normal ink colors (black, blue, red, green, and purple) and a normal set of tip sizes (0.38 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, and 1.0 mm / ultra fine, fine, medium, bold). The S-Gel is priced competitively, but isn’t particularly cheap at about 80 cents a pen, depending on the pack you buy.</p>

<h2><span id="S-Gel_Ink">S-Gel Ink</span></h2>
<p>The S-Gel ink offers the smooth writing experience you’d expect from a gel pen, but you’d be hard-pressed to call it extraordinary. Yes, it’s a high performance gel pen, but does it really offer an exceptional writing experience when compared to a <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/zebra-sarasa-grand/">Zebra Sarasa</a> or <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pentel-energel-alloy-gel/">Pentel Energel</a> or any of today’s other best gel pens?</p>
<p>Having used the blue and black gel ink colors extensively in both the standard black model, as well as the metal body executive version and the frosted blue barrel, I can say this is a very good gel pen and one I like using, but it’s not anything that we haven’t seen before. The pens are refillable, but refills aren’t currently available online, making this is a moot point for now.</p>
<p>The ink is quick drying, but not as resistant to smear and bleed through as the Energel. The ink is intensely colored, but doesn’t seem remarkable compared to a Uni-ball Signo. The fine tip is smooth, but not particularly smooth relative to a Jetstream.</p>
<h2><span id="Non-Permanent_Ink">Non-Permanent Ink</span></h2>
<p>The pen has the obvious and someone concerning quality of not using permanent ink. Sharpie is a brand build on permanent ink, so not seeing this in their gel pen is odd. Perhaps the permanence would have needed pigmented ink, which would have meant the pen wouldn’t be the smoothest possible gel pen, but it’s still going to be a surprise for many buyers.</p>
<p>The S-Gel has a contoured rubber grip that is similar to the sneaker grip of the Pilot Acroball. It’s comfortable and it holds up well, despite looking like the sort of grip that will break down over time, and get the shiny, oily feel of disintegrating rubber.</p>
<p>Today the S-Gel is a full pen lineup but at launch, in January 2020, it was just two sizes and two colors. At the same time Sharpie launched a rollerball pen — the Roller Pen — that hasn’t seen anywhere near the same success.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1024x458.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="251" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-450x201.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-768x343.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1536x687.jpg 1536w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-2048x915.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"></a></p>
<h2><span id="So_What_Happened">So What Happened?</span></h2>
<p>So what caused the S-Gel, with its relatively standard black ink and blue ink in 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm sizes to become the most popular Sharpie pen and perhaps the best selling new gel ink pen in years? Online reviews point to appreciate for the pen as a good writer and a useful office pen, but few highlight it as being one of the most exception products of 2020.</p>
<p>The obvious factor we’ve yet to discuss it the strength of the Sharpie brand. Perhaps simply through brand recognition and reach of its distribution network (via its parent company Newell Brands, owners of Waterman, PaperMate, Rotring, and others) the Sharpie S-Gel was able to brute-force its way into strong place in the market for gel ink pens.</p>
<h3><span id="What_About_The_Roller_Pen">What About The Roller Pen?</span></h3>
<p>So why did the same not happen with the Roller Pen? It’s hard to say, but it’s clear from trends of the past 5+ years that the gel pen has been overtaking the rollerball in the US. Customer preference is a strong thing, and the shift to retractable gel pens from capped rollerballs seems to be undeniable. Perhaps larger market forces made the success of the S-Gel likely and the lack of success of the Roller Pen inevitable?</p>
<h3><span id="Playing_The_Game_Well">Playing The Game Well</span></h3>
<p>The Sharpie marketing engine seems to be in full force, with the S-Gel ranking for multiple top spots on Amazon for generic terms like “gel pen” and even winning the top result for “pens.” This is combined with aggressive advertising on Amazon search placements for pen-related terms as well as placement in almost all the big box office stores in the US.</p>
<p>So, yes, the Sharpie S-Gel is a good pen and far be it from us to say it’s not deserving of its success, but seeing one pen explode in popularity while so many other new products remain obscure or see just middling success certainly raised questions with anyone who watches the pen market.</p>

<![CDATA[Hiring Software Devs Without Bullshit]]>

February 21, 2021 | https://lanning.bearblog.dev/hiring-without-bullshit/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lanning.bearblog.dev/hiring-without-bullshit/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Yes, it's yet another blog about issues with current technical hiring practices and what I'd like to see. First let's define the current Big Corp Hiring pipeline, which many other companies <a href="https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/cargo-cult-software-engineering/">love to copy</a>. Because we all know if we act like Google, we will be Google.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some sort of phone screen. I imagine this is to confirm you have a pulse, at least bothered to read what the company does, filter people with unpleasant voices, filter people with thick accents (which feels like racism to me), filter people who are too awkward, and other asinine reasons that essentially come down to "gut feeling". Frankly, I don't care if you're any of those things (well, you probably need a pulse, but I'm not a zombiest). I only care that you're pleasant to work with and competent. The great part about this is it's a "skill" hardened interviewers love to say they've "mastered" and they "just know" after a brief conversation with someone. Shockingly enough, these people never seem to self reflect on their accuracy saying "it's too hard to measure". It would actually be fairly easy to measure based on how many people who pass the phone screen ultimately fail the pipeline, or who are hired yet don't perform well, and/or checking where the candidates they didn't let through end up. Measuring would likely reveal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html">fairly poor accuracy</a> and systemic bias, so we'll skip that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A leet code question. This is to verify the person in question can "actually code". Programmers love to think most other programmers can't actually code and are dumb gorillas. What it's really testing is how well you can code while under extreme pressure, and that's <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">actually very hard to do</a>. It may also be under the guise of "seeing how the candidates think" or "how they explain themselves". Truthfully, I don't care how candidates think, I care about their solution. They should be able to explain their solution, but I could care less if the way they got there is a lesser demon whispering in their ear. Humans are bad at explaining how they discovered a solution to a problem, and when they try to explain, they're likely not explaining how they really solved the problem. What's likely happening is their leet code muscle memory kicked in, and now they have to ad-hoc rationalize some made up explanation. Another thing interviewers love to do is poorly define the problem to make sure you can "gather requirements". If you're not privy to this common haze, of course you're an idiot and a no hire.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat step two a few times. This is to "gather signal". Really, it's to weed out the smart developers who may have had good enough intuition to solve a few leet code questions without grinding them a few hours every night. You don't want developers like that, you want developers who will shut up and do the leet code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A culture fit round! Yep, like the phone screen we can filter out awkward people or people who are the wrong color or gender. A culture fit round gives us a free pass to do this after they've already proven themselves to be technically competent. I don't know about you, but I cannot tell if someone is a "culture fit" or pleasant to work with after a short lunch. Many studies have already shown humans are notoriously bad at judging someone based on first impressions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>tl;dr Hiring software devs is like choosing math professors based on how good they were at Math Olympiad. Clearly there's some correlation, but you'd be throwing away a lot of good professors.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Here are some options.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Have a public repo and a board of open cases candidates can do. Pay them for their work if you do accept their PR. Give them code review and see how they respond. If you like the work they do, hire them fulltime. This is essentially lightweight contracting. It's representative of their actual skill. The bastardized version of this are 2 to 3 hour long unpaid "take homes" which are then thrown directly into the trash are incredibly disrespectful to the candidates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let the candidate put forth their own work. Let them put forth whatever they want. Ask questions and take context into mind. Clearly a small personal project might not have an entire suite of tests and complicated CI/CD pipeline. Have the candidate do some code review on your own project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Solve a problem together. Yep, solve a problem that you haven't perfectly rehearsed. As a smug interviewer looking to clap down candidates, this is incredibly scary, but representative of how working with a coworker actually is. When you and your coworker collaborate on a real problem, no one knows the answer before hand, you figure it out together. Let them lead, but work together as if this was your real coworker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It deeply saddens me that the current hiring process is the best we've come up with and we need to do better.</p>

<p>In this guide, I will explain how to receive SMS messages and forward them to your Telegram account using Raspberry PI Zero W and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.waveshare.com/SIM7000E-NB-IoT-HAT.htm" target="_blank">Wireshare GSM hat</a>. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-21-14_09_49-Clipboard.png" alt="" width="473" height="380" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-21-14_09_49-Clipboard.png 945w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-21-14_09_49-Clipboard-300x241.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-21-14_09_49-Clipboard-768x618.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"></figure></div>



<p>Python will be used to read SMS messages and forward them to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" target="_blank">Telegram Bot API</a>. Messages will be listened to by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wammu.eu/smsd/" target="_blank">Gammu</a> SMS service and it will trigger the Python script when an SMS message received.  </p>



<h2>Setup</h2>



<p>First of all, we have to enable communication between GSM hat and Raspberry PI Zero, run Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config);</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo raspi-config</code></pre>



<p>Then, follow following actions;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" width="743" height="458" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 990w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-300x185.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px"><figcaption>Go to Interface Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" width="745" height="457" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png 993w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-300x184.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px"><figcaption>Select and enter P6 Serial Port</figcaption></figure>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png" alt="" width="740" height="458" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png 987w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-300x185.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>Select No at this screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png" alt="" width="740" height="459" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png 986w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-300x186.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>Lastly, select Yes at this screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Exit configuration tool. Now we need to enable UART on raspberry pi. Shutdown and eject SD card to open in another computer. Open /boot/config.txt file, find the below statement and uncomment it to enable the UART. You can directly append it at the end of the file as well.</p>



<pre><code>enable_uart=1</code></pre>



<p>Now, reboot raspberry pi device and open the console to install Gammu SMS Deamon and Python PiP package installer. </p>



<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip gammu-smsd</code></pre>



<p>Install Telegram Bot API python library.</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo pip install python-telegram-bot==12.3.0</code></pre>



<p><em>Note: Version 12.3.0 is the latest version that is compatible with Python 2.7, if you want to use it with Python 3+ version, you can install the latest available version.</em></p>



<p>Now you need to create a bot in Telegram and obtain a token. Afterwards, start a chat with that bot in your Telegram account and send a test message to your bot. This will help us to identify your chat ID. </p>



<p>Open following URL with you Telegram Bot token and copy the chat ID in the response; </p>



<pre><code>https://api.telegram.org/bot[YOUR-BOT-TOKEN]/getUpdates</code></pre>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="269" height="29" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>This is your chat ID.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Save following script in /home/pi/forward-telegram.py;</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
from __future__ import print_function
import os
import sys
import telegram

numparts = int(os.environ['DECODED_PARTS'])

text = ''
# Are there any decoded parts?
if numparts == 0:
    text = os.environ['SMS_1_TEXT']
# Get all text parts
else:
    for i in range(1, numparts + 1):
        varname = 'DECODED_%d_TEXT' % i
        if varname in os.environ:
            text = text + os.environ[varname]

# Log
print('Number %s have sent text: %s' % (os.environ['SMS_1_NUMBER'], text))

#Send by Telegram
bot = telegram.Bot(token='[YOUR-BOT-TOKEN]')
bot.send_message(chat_id=[YOUR CHAT ID], text=os.environ['SMS_1_NUMBER'].strip() + " | "+ text)
</code></pre>



<p>Make python file executable</p>



<pre><code>$ chmod +x /home/pi/forward-telegram.py</code></pre>



<p>Update Gammu SMS Deamon’s configuration to use GSM hat. Waveshare uses /dev/ttyS0 for communication. </p>



<pre><code>$ sudo nano /etc/gammu-smsdrc</code></pre>



<p>Find following lines in the configuration file and update with correct values, for me these values are following;</p>



<pre><code>port = /dev/ttyS0
connection = at115200</code></pre>



<p>Also, we need to specify the script path to be ran by Gammu so add following line below [smsd] section;</p>



<pre><code>RunOnReceive = /home/pi/forward-telegram.py</code></pre>



<p>You can find my complete configuration file <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mtrcn/045d7eeef1e38c092939d5ee87f96fb0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Restart Gammu SMS service.</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart gammu-smsd.service</code></pre>



<p>That’s all! You should now able to get your SMS messages to your Telegram account. </p>



<p>You can monitor Gammu SMS service for any problem with the following command;</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl status gammu-smsd.service</code></pre>

The direct integration of a climate model into the XDC Model allows for dynamic, future-oriented calculations of the influence of a company or portfolio on climate change.<br>‍<br>The results of scenario analyses can be used for setting and managing climate targets, risk management, reporting (from an inside-out perspective of double materiality), and communication.</p></div></div><section id="cards-section"><div><h2>Events</h2><div><div id="w-node-b743ba44-b251-01db-a5c3-b23140829710-8263727c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ddbd8f4d31f0fb0ad6f12fd/5f8ae0701829f4e8fb3309e9_Tech.PNG" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ddbd8f4d31f0fb0ad6f12fd/5f8ae0701829f4e8fb3309e9_Tech-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ddbd8f4d31f0fb0ad6f12fd/5f8ae0701829f4e8fb3309e9_Tech.PNG 780w" alt=""></p><h3><strong>Tech Conference</strong></h3><p><strong>November 6, 2020</strong>, Can Tech Save The World?

									<p><span>EAST WENATCHEE,&nbsp;Washington — Hands on the&nbsp;</span>wheel, eyes squinting against the winter sun, Lauren Miehe eases his Land Rover down the main drag and tells me how he used to spot promising sites to build a bitcoin mine, back in 2013, when he was a freshly arrived techie from Seattle and had just discovered this sleepy rural community.</p>
<p>The attraction then, as now, was the Columbia River, which we can glimpse a few blocks to our left. Bitcoin mining — the complex process in which computers solve a complicated math puzzle to win a stack of virtual currency — uses an inordinate amount of electricity, and thanks to five hydroelectric dams that straddle this stretch of the river, about three hours east of Seattle, miners could buy that power more cheaply here than anywhere else in the nation. Long before locals had even heard the words “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain,” Miehe and his peers realized that this semi-arid agricultural region known as the Mid-Columbia Basin was the best place to mine bitcoin in America — and maybe the world.</p>
<p>The trick, though, was finding a location where you could put all that cheap power to work. You needed an existing building, because in those days, when bitcoin was trading for just a few dollars, no one could afford to build something new. You needed space for a few hundred high-speed computer servers, and also for the heavy-duty cooling system to keep them from melting down as they churned out the trillions of calculations necessary to mine bitcoin. Above all, you needed a location that could handle a lot of electricity — a quarter of a megawatt, maybe, or even a half a megawatt, enough to light up a couple hundred homes.</p>
<p>The best mining sites were the old fruit warehouses — the basin is as famous for its apples as for its megawatts — but those got snapped up early. So Miehe, a tall, gregarious 38-year-old who would go on to set up a string of mines here, learned to look for less obvious solutions. He would roam the side streets and back roads, scanning for defunct businesses that might have once used a lot of power. An old machine shop, say. A closed-down convenience store. Or this: Miehe slows the Land Rover and points to a shuttered carwash sitting forlornly next to a Taco Bell. It has the space, he says. And with the water pumps and heaters, “there’s probably a ton of power distributed not very far from here,” Miehe tells me. “That could be a bitcoin mine.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past two years, the region has taken on the vibe of a boomtown.</p></blockquote>
<p>These days, Miehe says, a serious miner wouldn’t even look at a site like that. As bitcoin’s soaring price has drawn in <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/09/how-bitcoin-works-illustration-infographic-217333" target="_blank">thousands of new players worldwide</a>, the strange math at the heart of this cryptocurrency has grown steadily more complicated. Generating a single bitcoin takes a lot more servers than it used to — and a lot more power. Today, a half-megawatt mine, Miehe says, “is nothing.” The commercial miners now pouring into the valley are building sites with tens of thousands of servers and electrical loads of as much as 30 megawatts, or enough to power a neighborhood of 13,000 homes. And in the arms race that cryptocurrency mining has become, even these operations will soon be considered small-scale. Miehe knows of substantially larger mining projects in the basin backed by out-of-state investors from Wall Street, Europe and Asia whose prospecting strategy, as he puts it, amounts to “running around with a checkbook just trying to get in there and establish scale.”</p>
<p>For years, few residents really grasped how appealing their region was to miners, who mainly did their esoteric calculations quietly tucked away in warehouses and basements. But those days are gone. Over the past two years, and especially during 2017, when the price of a single bitcoin&nbsp;<a href="https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped</a>&nbsp;from $1,000 to more than $19,000, the region has taken on the vibe of a boomtown. Across the three rural counties of the Mid-Columbia Basin — Chelan, Douglas and Grant — orchards and farm fields now share the rolling landscape with mines of every size, from industrial-scale facilities to repurposed warehouses to cargo containers and even backyard sheds. Outsiders are so eager to turn the basin’s power into cryptocurrency that this winter, several would-be miners from Asia flew their private jet into the local airport, took a rental car to one of the local dams, and, according to a utility official, politely informed staff at the dam visitors center, “We want to see the dam master because we want to buy some electricity.”</p>
<p>The Mid-Columbia Basin isn’t the only location where the virtual realm of cryptocurrency is colliding with the real world of megawatts and real estate. In places like China, Venezuela and Iceland, cheap land and even cheaper electricity have resulted in bustling mining hubs. But the basin, by dint of its early start, has emerged as one of the biggest boomtowns. By the end of 2018, according to some estimates, miners here could account for anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all bitcoin mining in the world, and impressive shares of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple. And as with any boomtown, that success has created tensions. There have been disputes between miners and locals, bankruptcies and bribery attempts, lawsuits, even a kind of intensifying guerrilla warfare between local utility crews and a shadowy army of bootleg miners who set up their servers in basements and garages and max out the local electrical grids.</p>

<p>More broadly, the region is watching uneasily as one of its biggest natural resources — a gigantic surplus of hydroelectric power — is inhaled by a sector that barely existed five years ago and which is routinely derided as the next dot-com bust, or this century’s version of the Dutch tulip craze, or, as&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;columnist Paul Krugman&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/955107120671797248?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it in January</a>, a Ponzi scheme. Indeed, even as Miehe was demonstrating his prospecting chops, bitcoin’s price was already in a swoon that would touch $5,900 and rekindle widespread doubts about the future of virtual currencies.</p>
<p>For local cryptocurrency enthusiasts, these slings and arrows are all very much worth enduring. They believe not only that cryptocurrency will make them personally very wealthy, but also that this formerly out-of-the-way region has a real shot at becoming a center — and maybe&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>center — of a coming technology revolution, with the well-paid jobs and tech-fueled prosperity that usually flow only to gilded “knowledge” hubs like Seattle and San Francisco. Malachi Salcido, a Wenatchee building contractor who jumped into bitcoin in 2014 and is now one of the basin’s biggest players, puts it in sweeping terms. The basin, he tells me, is “building a platform that the entire world is going to use.”</p>
<p>And squarely between these two competing narratives are the communities of the Mid-Columbia Basin, which find themselves anxiously trying to answer a question that for most of the rest of us is merely an amusing abstraction: Is bitcoin for real?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><b>A few miles from the shuttered carwash</b>, David Carlson stands at the edge of a sprawling construction site and watches workers set the roof on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfrjhflKGzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giga Pod</a>, a self-contained crypto mine that Carlson designed to be assembled in a matter of weeks. When finished, the prefabricated wood-frame structure, roughly 12 by 48 feet, will be equipped with hundreds of high-speed servers that collectively draw a little over a megawatt of power and, in theory, will be capable of producing around 80 bitcoins a month. Carlson himself won’t be the miner; his company, Giga-Watt, will run the pod as a hosting site for other miners. By summer, Giga-Watt expects to have 24 pods here churning out bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, most of which use the same computing-intensive, cryptographically secured protocol called the blockchain. “We’re right where the rubber hits the road with blockchain,” Carlson shouts as we step inside the project’s first completed pod and stand between the tall rack of toaster-size servers and a bank of roaring cooling fans. The main use of blockchain technology now is to keep a growing electronic ledger of every single bitcoin transaction ever made. But many miners see it as the record-keeping mechanism of the future. “We’re where the blockchain goes from that virtual concept to something that’s real in the world,” says Carlson, “something that somebody had to build and is actually running.”</p>
<p>Granted, all that real-worlding and road-hitting is a little hard to visualize just now. The winter storms that have turned the Cascade Mountains a dazzling white have also turned the construction site into a reddish quagmire that drags at workers and equipment. There have also been permitting snafus, delayed utility hookups, and a lawsuit, recently settled, by impatient investors. But Carlson seems unperturbed. “They are actually making it work,” he told me earlier, referring to the mud-caked workers. “In a normal project, they might just say, ‘Let’s just wait till spring,’” Carlson adds. “But in bitcoin and blockchain, there is no stopping.” Indeed, demand for hosting services in the basin is so high that a desperate miner offered Carlson a Lamborghini if Carlson would bump him to the head of the pod waiting list. “I didn’t take the offer,” Carlson assures me. “And I like Lamborghinis!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the expanding bitcoin universe, lots of miners are turning their basements and spare bedrooms into jury-rigged data centers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carlson has become the face of the Mid-Columbia Basin crypto boom. Articulate, infectiously optimistic, with graying hair and a trim beard, the Microsoft software developer-turned-serial entrepreneur has built a series of mines, made (and lost) several bitcoin fortunes and endured countless setbacks to become one of the region’s largest players. Other local miners credit Carlson for launching the basin’s boom, back in 2012, when he showed …</p></div></div>

		<p>Most of the digital products we use today are designed for our eyes, simply because as highly visual beings, we rely on our sight a lot.</p>

<p>Whether we’re reading microcopy to understand what a button does, or scanning through textual instructions to familiarize with a new machine, interacting with devices using visual cues is what we’re very used to.</p>
<p>But what happens when visual feedback is secondary? How does that change the way we interact with interfaces, and the way they’re designed for us?</p>
<p>Voice User Interfaces (VUI) like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are designed differently from screen-first interfaces for many reasons — the main one being that the principles of spoken communication differ from those of written communication. Because of that, UX designers cannot approach voice-first interfaces the same way they do screen-first interfaces.</p>
<p>How and why should they be done differently? Let’s dive into some of the best practices in voice design.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Practices in Voice Design</strong></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-design/get-started.html">Amazon’s Alexa Design Guide</a>, voice interfaces should be four things — adaptable, personal, relatable, and available. Both Amazon’s guide and <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/df-asdk/design">Google Assistant’s Conversation design guide</a> stress that voice-first skills should be natural and user-centric for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the best practices in designing user experiences for voice user interfaces.</p>
<h3>1. Be Flexible and Receptive</h3>
<p>Language is dynamic. Let’s say a user wants to make a call, they can say <em>“Call X”</em>, <em>“Ring X”</em>, <em>“Get X on the phone”</em>, or a thousand more other variations that can be matched to the same “Call” intent. Your skill must be able to pick up on key details in varied utterances, even if there are multiple embedded in a single answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to save time, users may string multiple pieces of information in a single command or response to a question. For example, if one says…</p>
<p><em>“Set a reminder for my interview with Snappymob at 3pm tomorrow.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>…they likely don’t want to repeat any of the information they’ve already mentioned. It’d show a lack of receptiveness to follow the exchange with <em>“What time would you like to set your reminder for?”</em> or <em>“What’s the reminder for?”</em>, because then the user would have to repeat <em>“3pm”</em> or <em>“Interview with Snappymob”</em>.</p>
<p>When your interface is able to pick up on additional information that wasn’t asked for, and fill in the gaps unprompted, you create a more intuitive experience for your users.</p>
<h3>2. Ask Questions, One at a Time</h3>
<p>Simply speaking, users need to know when their cue is. With voice-activated devices, asking questions lets them know when they need to respond.</p>
<p>Phrasing in statements rather than questions, like <em>“Let me know where you would like to go.”</em> instead of <em>“Where would you like to go?”</em> makes it unclear if the user needs to prompt the next activity with an answer.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion on both sides, it’s also standard to ask for one piece of information at a time. For instance, asking a user <em>“What is your new contact’s name, mobile number, and email address?”</em> might cause information overload and make forming an answer difficult. Instead, ask single-answer questions to fill in the blanks one by one.</p>
<h3>3. Present Clear Options</h3>
<p>Unlike visual interfaces, with voice-first, users aren’t choosing from navigation menus they can visually scan through. Hence, it’s important to relay their options in a clear and concise manner. This is where you need to pay attention to language.</p>
<p>Syntax matters especially with distinguishing between either/or questions and yes/no questions. For example, <em>“Would you like twister fries or french fries to go with your meal?”</em> could sound like a yes or no question. Instead, to make the option prompt clearer, it could be phrased like <em>“Which side would you like: Twister fries or french fries?”</em>.</p>
<h3>4. Narrow Down to Only the Necessary</h3>
<p>This applies to both questions and choices. Text can be scanned through, but spoken words take time to relay — so be succinct.</p>
<p>Only ask for confirmation for actions with high importance, like making calls, sending text messages, and any action that involves recipients or monetary transactions.</p>
<p>Asking for unnecessary confirmation or making users reiterate information can easily frustrate them. For example, an <em>“Are you sure” </em>confirmation might not be necessary for simple commands like <em>“Turn off the lights”</em> or <em>“Tell me the current price for Bitcoin”</em>, but necessary for <em>“Send email” </em>and <em>“Call Cindy”</em>.</p>
<p>As for choices, make sure your users aren’t bombarded with ten choices at a time. Remember that unlike text, users can’t scan back and forth to digest a message with speech. Giving them too much information to process at a time will lead to more errors in comprehension and exchange.</p>
<h3>5. Restate Questions</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, on voice-first interfaces, users aren’t relying primarily on a visual navigation menu. So to make sure they know where they are, it’s always helpful to reinstate the questions they answer.</p>
<p>For example, when a user asks for the recipe for spaghetti bolognese, it’s clearer to respond with <em>“To make spaghetti bolognese, the ingredients are…”</em> instead of jumping straight into <em>“The ingredients are…”</em>. A simple restatement reassures the user that they’re getting the answer they’re looking for.</p>
<h3>6. Be Prepared for Blockers</h3>
<p>Being well-prepared includes being prepared for scenarios where things don’t go as planned. Here are some of the most common blockers to think ahead for when designing for voice user interfaces:</p>
<h3><strong>Corrections</strong></h3>
<p>When a VUI gets a piece of information wrong, users will naturally correct it with common phrases like <em>“No, I said-”</em> or a simply a reiteration of their command.</p>
<p>Your interface must be able to pick up on corrections, accept them instantaneously, and restate the command for confirmation.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehension Failures</strong></h3>
<p>When the VUI fails to understand the user’s command, it’s important to handle the error with grace.</p>
<p>The standard way to approach this is with a statement followed by a repetition of the question, like <em>“Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Who would you like to share this link with?”</em>. This is to make it clear to the user that they should reiterate their answer following the cue.</p>
<h3><strong>Unavailable Functions</strong></h3>
<p>When a user asks for a function that doesn’t exist, instead of using the standard <em>“Sorry, I didn’t get that”</em> response repeatedly, let them know what can be done for them instead to move the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Here’s a scenario — a user says <em>“Cook me spaghetti”</em>. Instead of ending the exchange with “Sorry, I couldn’t understand that”, respond with <em>“I can only help you find recipes for spaghetti. Would you like me to look for the best ones?”.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Non-Responses</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes users forget to answer, or abandon ship halfway through a conversation. Some other times, the VUI doesn’t pick up on the sound input. In situations like these, re-prompts are necessary to give the user another go at answering a question, in case the non-response wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>In the re-prompts, it’s important to restate where they left off, so they know where to pick up. For example, a user doesn’t respond after saying <em>“Set a reminder”</em>. The re-prompt should restate what the user’s intent was, and what they should do next, something like this — <em>“I can help you set a reminder. What would you like to be reminded for?”</em>.</p>

<p>Belief in the context of this article is free of any spiritual or religious meaning.</p>

<p>This article's idea is inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blazor/comments/l89iit/blazor_server_logging_from_service/">reddit thread</a>, I participated. The specific topic is not relevant but the reactions of one group of people, started by the statement.</p>

<p>Making a service static is the worst idea you could've possibly done.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804592/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/discussion-reddit-self-afirming-beliefs_slgdnq.jpg" alt="screenshot of the Reddit discussion"></p>
<p>If someone is asking why to understand a matter, like in this thread, such a response isn't helpful. It is not an explanation; instead, it is a statement of a belief. It is "so" evident (to them) that a proper explanation is not needed anymore.  Others could have demanded a reason, but more remarkable, they kicked off a self-affirmation loop.</p>
<p>It is a behavior that I didn't expect to see in professional-focused discussions, especially not around us developers. I was curious. Is this an exception, or is it a habitual action? I found an overwhelming amount of debates (online and offline) with these recurrent patterns.</p>
<p>But why should we care about it? Why should we care that debates are turning this way?</p>
<p>Why is the presented quota a statement of belief? And why have beliefs an impact on our productivity? One of the text's central argument is that beliefs are a simplification of reality.</p>
<p>They are not inherently bad. The most professional beliefs we have are not something like believing that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-glance-at-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-incendiary-words/2021/02/04/b0748070-6745-11eb-bab8-707f8769d785_story.html#google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.politics_4:%7E:text=SPACE%20LASERS">a secret Jewish space laser silence the advocates for functional programming</a>, and hence, it not a mainstream thing. Our professional beliefs are definitely not as deranged, although the impacts of beliefs in software development are severe too.  On the individual level, the person is missing a learning opportunity and hence facing a productivity loss. That is an argument we examine in this article. However, this personal effect is accelerated by peer dynamic, resulting in teams or even organizational level to a denial of facts. One of the multiple reasons the solar wind hack has been possible was <a href="https://thenewstack.io/solarwinds-the-worlds-biggest-security-failure-and-open-sources-better-answer/#13865249:%7E:text=Ironically%2C%20SolarWinds%20claimed%20open%20source%20software,can%20infect%20it%20with%20malicious%20code">the belief that security through obscurity works and open discussion about security hinders a successful implementation</a>.</p>
<p>It is a long path to understand the effects of beliefs on your productivity, but it's worth it. Being open to new ideas is one of the best ways to have sustainable productivity: once that is stable today and tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Beliefs as a simplification of a complex reality</h2>
<p>Metaphysics is a branch inside the philosophy that developed concepts around reality. As with many other social sciences, there are conflicting points of view, heated debates, and sometimes delicious humor around reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804930/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/meme-tree-falls-in-forest_mftuft.jpg" alt="Meme about a tree is falling in the forest"></p>
<p>That people can live in different realities doesn't only become evident after the US 2020 election but also for people living with others suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Reality is the objective truth of things, in all of its complexity and known and unknown relationships.  Reality doesn't need to be recognized to exist. For instance, the electric current is real (and measurable), whether you choose to plug in your device or not. Deregulating banks and the finance sector to create wealth for everyone is not reality because its sole existence is based on humans' minds choosing to follow this narrative. It wouldn't exist if humans didn't exist.</p>
<p>However, based on our limited sensory and intellectual capacity, we, as humans, can only perceive a fraction of reality at a time. We experience reality, and this experience is subjective. Very often, humans confuse this experience with reality itself.  As mentioned earlier, some mental illnesses prove that point. Patients see things we don't recognize. They hear voices we can't listen to. For them, what they experienced is real.  Thoughts of deep trauma can be experienced as authentic now, even if the occurrence lies years in the past.</p>
<p>Multiple past experiences are combined - sometimes more melted -  into a theory. A theory is an explanation of <em>how reality is</em> in a particular circumstance. Theories are the foundation for <em>judgments</em>. Judgment is the anticipation of a theory coming true. If judgments have been proven "right" enough times, they become a <strong>belief</strong>.</p>
<p>Toddlers are representing excellent examples of incorporating multiple experiences into a theory. Imagine a scenario where various toys have been given to a kid. Let's say green and red ones. The red toys make sounds and the green ones don't. After a couple of tries, their brains combine the experience of reality (red) with another experience of reality (make sounds when shaking) and create the theory that red toys make sounds. After enough tries, they started the judgment that they need to interact with red ones if they want to hear a sound.  If more toys with different colors are added and don't make a sound, the toddler created a belief: Only red toys make a sound.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804959/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/kids-believes-only-red-toys-make-a-sound_uzoo8n.jpg" alt="After trying different toys, a child creates the belief that red toys make a sound"></p>
<p>With our experience (because we experience many contradicting examples), we can easily see that there is no correlation between the color of a toy and its ability to make a sound. But for them, this belief drives their behavior.</p>
<p>Beliefs are a necessity. Without beliefs, we would be overwhelmed with the infinite complexity of reality. Literally, we couldn't survive a day. Going back to the toddler example and imagine a situation where there are multiple toys, and the toddler wants to hear a sound. Believing (as a result of experience) that red toys make a sound is incredibly beneficial in this circumstance because they can "safely" ignore all other toys.</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs are a simplifications of reality, a model, and not reality itself.</strong></p>
<p>Based on that, we can visualize a reality funnel. Each level is a simplification of the class before.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612805033/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/the-belief-funnel_anvasy.jpg" alt="The reality funnel as a filter system to handle the infinity complexity of reality"></p>
<h2>Software development is complex enough so that an individual is unable to know the system entirely</h2>
<p>While the section before talked about reality as the foundation, I want to show that the same mechanism applies to non-natural systems too. Modern software development (maybe starting 20 years back) is so complex that it can't be understood fully. You can't possibly know all the implications of your source code or knowing all the side effects. It is not as complex as reality itself, but in its whole, it is unknowable.  I want to call this a <strong>meta-reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of the time, we experience this meta-reality not using our senses but through a thought based feedback process. It can be a debugger, indicated which control path a program goes. It can be logging at a console or LEDs turning on and off.  My personal best example is creating a layout in HTML with Bootstrap, something I haven't understood fully. Usually, I apply classes to certain elements and hope that they arrange in a way I want them to.</p>
<p>These examples have in common that we create an input (our source code) and experience the result. Based on that experience, we make a theory about how the meta-reality works. Because we can't easily sense this kind of reality, the experience (or should I say beliefs) of other individuals become more vital in the construction of our theories, judgments, and beliefs.</p>
<p>For instance - before we have even experience with classes - we can just by reading, listening, and watching incorporate the theory that classes are beneficial to structure code and separating concerns. The massive amount of different available sources give their theory the needed credibility to evolve into a judgment. It is important to note that this judgment could be created before you write your code for the first time. In the end, the belief that classes are the only way to structure your code is created.</p>
<p>In the meta-reality, beliefs have the same function: Reducing complexity and make choices easier. Instead of thinking about the best approach to structure code, the belief kicks in, and you choose classes within seconds. (This leads to the next belief about finding the perfect name. :wink: )</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612805207/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/classes-as-the-best-way-to-structure-code_dbs2u7.png" alt="Based on beliefs, classes are the only option to structure source code"></p>
<h2>Once created, a belief can stick for a long time</h2>
<p>Creating a belief is a thought and input-intensive process. Once created, most persons tend to protect their investment and shield their beliefs from contradicting experiences. Either they don't pay attention to new experiences by trying out different ways, or they don't listen to people with conflicting opinions. The situation is worsening, with our human tendency to group with people having the same beliefs. Once we are a member of a group, we protect the group. Regarding beliefs, this tendency can create the self-assuring loops seen in the Reddit thread (and so much more).</p>
<p>Another approach to structure code is functional programming. I'm not advocating for one over the other. You can hardly find people that are doing (and enjoying) both: functional and object-orientated programming. Object orientation is widely mainstream. So programmers feel less concerned in paying attention to non OOP approaches. While functional programmers, a minority, need to stick together even more. So evidence that OOP could be beneficial, at least in some cases, are dropped. In the end, you have to pick a side: Either you doing OOP or functional programming. But isn't that too simple?</p>
<h2>Sticking to beliefs drops long term productivity</h2>
<p>In reality - likewise in meta-reality - change is constant. In reality, though, it is easier to sense it. Hence contradicting experiences can more quickly emerge and lead to a shift in a theory, judgment, and eventually belief.</p>
<p>I'd argue that since (western) nations experience climate change in their daily lives more severely (new experience), it changes the way they experience reality. This alteration leads to hopefully and eventually new beliefs. Using fossil fuels has a severe downside and is not an investment option for the future, which is now a common belief in society.</p>
<p>The sensing in the meta-reality is much, much more complicated. There are incidents so evident that ignoring is practically impossible, like broken builds due to now obsolete calls to APIs. The relationship between cause and effect can easily be spotted, which shortened the feedback loop tremendously. It …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>In our <a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/releases/tag/v0.30.0">recent version of lakeFS</a>, we switched to base <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit">metadata storage on immutable files stored on S3</a> and other common object stores.&nbsp; Our design is inspired by Git, but for object stores rather than filesystems, and with (much) larger repositories holding machine-generated commits. The design document is informative but by nature omits much of the reasoning behind it.&nbsp; This is (hopefully) the first in a series of posts that dive deeply into the details and rationale behind it.&nbsp; It discusses <em>why</em> the graveler 2-level storage design is useful for the immutable key-value store needed, and <em>how</em> we benchmarked in order to choose its parameters to get good caching of data from S3.&nbsp; Future posts will discuss why we specifically chose the <a href="https://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB SSTable file <em>format</em></a> and its <em>implementation</em> using the <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/">Pebble SSTable library from CockroachDB</a>.</p>



<p>The new design for committed storage, in brief:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>commit</em> combines some commit metadata with a list of all its stored named objects.</li><li>This list is stored in an immutable key-value format termed <em>graveler</em>.</li><li>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit#bookmark=id.nvxia26m6klf"><em>graveler</em> key-value store</a> is an SSTable mapping keys (lakeFS pathnames) to values (object S3 URLs with some per-object metadata).</li><li>This SSTable is split across multiple S3 objects, each holding a <em>range</em> — an SSTable of contiguous key-value pairs.</li><li>Each range has an ID, and the list of ranges is stored in a <em>metarange</em> — an SSTable of IDs of range, keyed by that last key in each range.</li></ul>



<p>In essence this is a B+Tree of height 2.</p>

<p>We think this is a great top-level design!&nbsp; It…</p>



<ul><li>transfers a successful architecture for solving a similar problem (git) to our domain;</li><li>arranges standard building blocks, such as SSTables and object-store objects, in well-understood patterns;</li><li> uses immutability to allow for reproducibility and concurrency.</li></ul>



<p>But it has many knobs, and it leaves many low-level decisions open.</p>



<h2>Outline of graveler</h2>



<p>We store committed data in <em>graveler</em>.&nbsp; A commit in both Git and lakeFS is a binding of specific versions of the objects (files) in that commit with some additional <em>commit metadata</em> – such as parent commit IDs, commit message, author, user metadata.&nbsp; Actual versions of objects – the “data” – are stored on underlying object storage (typically S3); for our purposes here with an arbitrary path.&nbsp; graveler is our system that maps object paths in a specific revision to the object paths on underlying storage.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="953" height="676" src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed.png" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed.png" alt="Graveler 2 revisions" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed.png 953w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-300x213.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-768x545.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-24x17.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-36x26.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-48x34.png 48w" data-sizes="(max-width: 953px) 100vw, 953px" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed.png 953w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-300x213.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-768x545.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-24x17.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-36x26.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/imageLikeEmbed-48x34.png 48w"></figure></div>



<p>This example shows graveler holding 2 revisions.&nbsp; File “a/file” <em>changes</em> between revisions, file “a/nother” is deleted, file “be/good” is renamed to “bat/man”, and file “be/tter” remains unchanged.&nbsp; The object names on underlying storage are immaterial to graveler.&nbsp; Additionally, because lakeFS is a versioned object store, it has no direct concept of “directories”: files are attached to paths.&nbsp; Splitting on separator characters (typically “/”) occurs at a higher level; graveler need merely provide an efficient “seek until &gt;=” operation.</p>



<p>Just as in Git, <em>commits never change</em>.&nbsp; So graveler is an immutable key-value store, that behaves as a large SSTable.&nbsp; However, the design of graveler faces some different forces from that of Git:</p>



<ul><li>graveler must be able to hold many more paths.&nbsp; A repository with merely millions of paths is <em>small</em>.&nbsp;</li><li>graveler uses a remote underlying storage.&nbsp; Remote files are fetched using the tiered filing system described in a previous blog post, “<a href="https://lakefs.io/tiers-in-the-cloud-how-lakefs-caches-immutable-data-on-local-disk/">Tiers in the Cloud: How lakeFS caches immutable data on local-disk</a>”.&nbsp; But access to any object that is not cached locally is <em>slow</em>, and random access is only an option after successfully retrieving the entire object.</li></ul>



<p>This leads to different implementation choices.</p>



<h2>Metadata object sizes</h2>



<p>A lakeFS repository uses the underlying storage for two different tasks:</p>



<ol><li>Storing <em>user</em> data objects.&nbsp; The number and size of these objects is controlled by the user, and an efficient workload already controls these parameters to allow efficient operation on the underlying storage.</li><li>Storing <em>metadata</em> objects.&nbsp; lakeFS controls the number and size of these objects, and must do so efficiently.</li></ol>



<p>lakeFS has multiple typical access patterns to committed data:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fully sequential </strong>(rare): When delivering a full listing of objects, or when computing a diff or merge of very different commits.</li><li><strong>Sequential with random skips</strong>: When listing objects with paths matching a particular prefix, or when computing a diff or merge of rather similar commits.</li><li><strong>Random but local skips</strong>: A typical “big data” application will access particular subsets of paths, and access paths within each subset in roughly lexicographical order.</li><li><strong>Random</strong>: When accessing a single file.</li></ul>



<p>So SSTables are a good fit for committed data in lakeFS, just as it is for unchanging data in many other object stores.&nbsp; Indeed, Git stores its files in tree objects — essentially per-directory SSTables.</p>



<p>Picking “good” object sizes requires benchmarking.  We use the very comprehensive S3 benchmark numbers from <a href="https://github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark">github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark</a>.</p>



<p>Time to download a file from an object store can roughly be modelled as <em>t<sub>initial</sub> + size/bandwidth</em>: a roughly fixed cost to start downloading, followed by time to download all remaining bytes.&nbsp; Here are some of dvassallo’s numbers for times achieved for 10 threads running on c5.4xlarge instances.&nbsp;<em>t<sub>initial</sub></em> is roughly the <em>time to request</em>.</p>

<pre><code><strong>A note on benchmarking S3</strong>
S3 timing is unfortunately not generally repeatable.&nbsp; These numbers represent the <em>lowest latency</em> I could measure over 3 regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-central-1) over a few days.&nbsp; Other measured latencies were around 18-19 msec for 90th percentile of time to request.</code></pre>



<p>In all cases time to request is barely affected by object size&nbsp; At object sizes below 512 KiB it is comparable to the time to receive the entire object.&nbsp; So object sizes below 512 KiB are always less effective for our access patterns: taking into account that they perform more accesses, <em>they require strictly </em><strong><em>more</em></strong><em> time to fetch metadata on any number of files</em>.</p>



<p>Large objects are less effective for all access patterns that access only parts of the repository, they potentially fetch more data than needed.&nbsp; At the same time, graveler design allows us to <em>re-use shared objects</em> between SSTables for different commits.&nbsp; In order to do this we need those objects to be shared; this is easier to do with smaller objects: An object needs to be rewritten whenever it changes.&nbsp; So splitting an SSTable between more objects makes each object more re-usable.</p>



<p>In light of this, we designed graveler to use object sizes of 1-10 MiB.</p>



<h2>Lightweight B+Trees</h2>



<p>A repository can contain hundreds of millions of objects at a single commit.&nbsp; Git overloads the directory structure of the files in the repository in order to determine <em>tree objects</em>.&nbsp; Each tree object holds a single directory, linking to additional tree objects for subdirectories.</p>



<p>lakeFS data repositories are somewhat different from Git source code repositories.&nbsp; Firstly, they tend to have orders of magnitude <em>more</em> objects – even billions of objects.&nbsp; But performance of directory scans is much <em>less</em> important in data lakes than performance of sequential scans, and directory structures can be very deep (8 or more levels are common).&nbsp; This allows us to separate concerns differently.</p>



<p>Graveler stores a sorted list of key-value pairs in multiple consecutive files.&nbsp; “Leaf” files are termed <em>ranges</em>.&nbsp; These hold the actual values: path to object on underlying object store and additional per-object metadata.&nbsp; We try to keep leaf files to have sizes in the range on 1-10 MiB.&nbsp; The different ranges hold non-overlapping ranges of keys.&nbsp; The list of references to range objects is stored in a separate file termed a <em>metarange</em>.&nbsp; It holds the range files in order of their keys, indexed by last key.</p>



<p>So the graveler SSTable is stored pretty much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+Tree</a> with 2 levels: a root (metarange) and leaf nodes (ranges).&nbsp; Internal nodes are identified by digests of their contents, making this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree"><em>Merkle tree</em></a>.&nbsp; Nodes with the same contents receive identical identifiers, allowing for re-using nodes between similar trees as well as constant-time comparisons.</p>



<h3>Only 2 levels?</h3>



<p>We <em>do not currently limit the size of metarange files</em>.&nbsp; A typical object entry is &lt;512 bytes, so a 10 MiB range file can hold 20K object entries.&nbsp; Given that we have more control over names of range file objects, a 10 MiB metarange file can hold rather more than 20K object entries, for a total of 400M object entries.<br>What happens if the metarange file is too large?&nbsp; We just keep it large.&nbsp; It turns out that we do not lose much!&nbsp; Almost all of the nodes in any B+Tree are near the leaves.&nbsp; The massive branching-factor of our nodes means that we would add at most 1 level if we split the metarange file: even splitting the root into just 100 entries would give a graveler file capable of holding 40G object entries.&nbsp; The gains from adding intermediate nodes are not much: a minimal increase in caching and dedupe efficiency (almost all of the cache and dedupe are for ranges, not metaranges), in exchange for <em>no</em> reduction in latency (all accesses would now require 3 steps rather than 2 as before).</p>



<pre><code><strong>A note about Git packfiles
</strong>As mentioned above, Git holds many more tree objects per file than we hold range objects.&nbsp; It reduces the number of files that it needs to access by collecting small objects into “pack files”.&nbsp; This significantly reduces the total size of repository metadata, and allows it to regain much of …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

    <p>Semantic Versioning is better than most Versioning systems today, but because it means different things to different people, it remains more of a Social Versioning system than a semantic one.</p>
<p>I propose a new Versioning Scheme named Mark Versioning, which aims to separate and preserve both social and semantic aspects of versioning.</p>
<p>A <em>Mark</em> is a specific version of a software. This number is decided by social consensus, and represents major iterations / changes to a software. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 whenever appropriate.</p>
<p>A <em>Revision</em> is similar to a Mark, but it represents a strict change in API. This may be a breaking or a no breaking change. Reversions start at 0 for each mark, and are incremented by one whenever an API change is detected. This should be done automatically by package management software.</p>
<p>A <em>Hash</em> is the particular SHA-3 hash (in hex form, truncated to 8 characters) of a the source code of a software version. A Revision may have multiple different hashes. Alternatively, one can start from 0 with each Revision and automatically increment by 1 with each change. This should be done automatically.</p>
<p>Mark Versioning can be written out in two forms: long and short.</p>
<p>Long form: </p>
<pre><code>Mark &lt;X&gt; Revision &lt;Y&gt; Hash &lt;zzzzzzzz&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Short form:</p>
<pre><code>m&lt;X&gt;r&lt;Y&gt;#&lt;zzzzzzzz&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>Mark 3 Revision 16 Hash ae473ff6
</code></pre>
<p>Same in short form:</p>
<pre><code>m3r16#ae473ff6
</code></pre>
<p>Optionally, one can leave off Hash or Hash and Revision (if Hash is present, Revision must be present):</p>
<pre><code>Mark 0
Mark 0 Revision 0
Mark 0 Revision 0 Hash 0

m0
m0r0
m0r0#0
</code></pre>
<p>That's all.</p>

<p><span>We know exactly when the Viking Age
began in England – it was more than 1,200 years ago – on June 8, 793. That was
the day when invading Norsemen destroyed the Abbey church on the island of
Lindisfarne, off the north-east coast of England. Lindisfarne was a centre of
learning famous across the continent – but that meant nothing to these fierce
invaders.</span></p>

<tr><td>The Vikings arrived in England in 793 AD</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><span>Monks were either killed in the abbey,
thrown into the sea to drown or carried away as slaves – along with the church’s
treasures. The devastation of Northumbria’s Holy Island shocked Europe. “Never
before has such an atrocity been seen”, declared the Northumbrian scholar,
Alcuin of York. The Vikings had announced themselves in a devastating way. This
was just a warning of what was to come.</span></p>

<p><span>Over the next 300 years, more and more
invaders would flood into England, and Leicestershire would be full of Vikings.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Divided country</span></b></p>
<p><span>At the
time, England was not one united country – it was divided up into Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms.</span><b> </b><span>Leicester was
included within Mercia, and was known as Legreceastre. It was the principal
city in that kingdom. Even a thousand years ago and more, Legreceastre was a
bit of a melting pot.</span><b> </b><span>It
was a meeting point of several different cultures – the Angles from the Wash
and the Humber, Saxons from Warwickshire, Mercians from the Trent, and Celts
from the hills of Charnwood. In Leicester, they met, traded and eventually
settled.</span><b> </b><span>What increasingly
united these peoples was Christianity.</span><b>
</b><span>Mercia was Christian – the “new” religion reached Leicester in the
year 658. A church was said to have stood from the 7th century on the current
St Margaret’s site.</span><b> </b><span>Leicestershire,
as we know it, was in the heart of the Mercian kingdom and is thought to have
been the capital for political and ecclesiastical affairs. It was far enough
away from the frontiers to avoid changing hands as the unstable boundaries of
the mini-kingdom advanced and receded.</span><b>
</b><span>But what the Anglo-Saxons had worked so hard to build in
Leicestershire, was about to come to an end. The Scandinavian enemy was at the
gates and Mercia would never be the same again.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Ruthlessly pillaged</span></b></p>
<p><span>In 10 short years, between 865 and 874,
the whole structure of life in Mercia collapsed. A huge Scandinavian army
marched and pillaged up and down England. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has
preserved a glimpse of these years of chaos in its records of “a great heathen
army” that pillaged East Anglia in the year 865. Between 865 and 868 the
Northmen widened their field for plunder and tribute to East Mercia. Leicester
was attacked in 868, partly destroying the ancient Roman city walls.</span></p>

<p><span>Thousands of Danes swarmed down the
River Soar in their small, easily-managed boats, penetrating the very heart of
the country, carrying fire and sword among the simple and terrified population,
whom they ruthlessly pillaged and massacred. In the winter of 874 to 5, after
defeating Burhed, King of Mercia in battle, the raiders established their
quarters at Repton on the River Trent. Monasteries, the repositories of rich
and beautiful objects in gold, silver and jewellery, formed particular targets
for the pagan invaders. The monastery that had been founded at Breedon in
Leicestershire was reputedly sacked. But these Danes didn’t just hit and run,
like the early invaders on Lindisfarne.</span></p>

<tr><td>The Vikings swarmed down the River Soar</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><span>In its records of the year 877, the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests a permanent settlement of the land. The Danish
army it says “went into the land of the Mercians, and shared out some of it,
and gave some to Ceolwulf”. Ceolwulf was the puppet king whom the Danes placed
on the Mercian throne. It seems Mercia was now divided in half.</span></p>

<p><span>Large parts of its eastern territories
had passed into the hands of the Scandinavian invaders and were open to
settlement. Within the next decade, in 886, the losses of Anglo-Saxon territory
in Mercia were clearly defined by a treaty that King Alfred the Great concluded
with Guthrum, the leader of the Danes, after his Wessex Saxons had recaptured
London.</span></p>

<p><span>A permanent “country of Danes” was now
established within England, known as the Danelaw. This Danish part of England
comprised the greater part of eastern England from East Anglia to North
Yorkshire, incorporating most of Leicestershire. You could say that Leicester
was part of Denmark.</span></p>

<p><span>Leicestershire was close to the Danelaw
boundary though, and it is believed that some of the wealthier inhabitants
migrated with as many possessions as they could carry. As the churches were
destroyed and Christian rites trampled, the Bishop of Leicester retired to
safety at Dorchester-on-Thames. It would be more than a thousand years before
there would again be a Diocese of Leicester. Leicester, with Derby, Nottingham,
Lincoln and Stamford, became one of the “Five Boroughs” of the Danelaw. Leicester,
as a former Anglo-Saxon royal city, continued its importance under Danish rule.
Danish forms of taxation and local government took root in Leicester.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Danish Leicester</span></b></p>
<p><span>Although the Danelaw’s existence was
relatively short-lived, it left an everlasting mark on the history of
Leicestershire. The Scandinavians left an indelible impression on the language
of the East Midlands. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Vocabulary,
grammatical structures and the very tones of local dialect were deeply affected
by the contact with Scandinavia. Despite this, there aren’t many archeological
finds to be seen; visible remains of the Norsemen are hard to come by. Leicestershire’s
archaeological record lacks burials, pottery and everyday implements.</span></p>

<p><span>Finds that we do have are generally
personal ornaments such as brooches, horse accessories, coinage and weaponry. There
are also some distinctly Irish objects found in Leicestershire that were
probably plundered by Vikings during raids, and transported back to the Danelaw
lands. Such finds include a “shrine mount” from Breedon and belt buckles from
Melton.</span></p>

<p><span>Our understanding of Danish settlement
and the geography of the Danelaw depends largely on the evidence of
Scandinavian place-names. The place-name ending of by, which means a farm or
more usually a settlement, is seen throughout Denmark. That same ending is
common in England too. In Leicestershire alone, 56 villages end in by (such as Oadby)
and of these, half the number contain a Danish personal name as their other
element. But towards Leicester, on the broad gravel spreads where the River
Wreake empties into the Soar, the character of place-names changes. The sounds
of the Scandinavian invaders gives way to names of an older Mercian origin with
names ending in -ton. Thrussington, Syston and Cossington all speak of an
earlier period in Leicestershire’s settlement history. Even though the ton
element suggests the presence of a settlement that survived the impact of the
Danish army, the first element in these names is frequently a Scandinavian
personal name. Many Leicestershire villages were named after powerful Danes.
Ingarsby is named after the Danish Prince Ingar and it is now believed that
Humberstone may be named after Ingar’s brother, Hubba. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Both Princes entered Leicester during the
Danish invasion and could have settled in the villages named after themselves.</span></p>

<p><span>But as well as being named after actual
people, many villages were named after the gods. Thurmaston, Thurcaston,
Thurlaston and Thurnby all owe their name to one of the principal pagan gods of
the Scandinavian culture – Thor, who together with Odin, were the most commonly
worshipped gods. An archaeological find from Leicestershire of a miniature
“Thor’s Hammer”, the god’s famous magical weapon, is on display in the Jewry
Wall Museum.</span></p>

</tbody></table>

<p><b><span>Names are clues</span></b></p>
<p><span>With invading forces, you may assume
that they would settle on the broad and fertile river terraces of the Soar. But
settlements already existed here and new areas of land were needed to house the
large band of men who came to dwell in Leicestershire. By the study of
place-names, it appears that they turned towards the emptier and perhaps less
rewarding river terraces that flank the narrow valley of the Wreake. Along that
river we find Frisby, Hoby, Rotherby, Brooksby and Rearsby. The word “Wreake”
is also derived from Scandinavia, being the Old Norse word for “twisted”. So,
Wreake is both a description and the new name for the river once known as the
River Eye. Historian Sir Frank Stenton said the Wreake settlement was occupied
by a large body of the Danish army who took permanent occupation of the land
some time around 877.</span></p>

<p><span>The army would have been stationed here
so it could spring to the defence of Leicester if the town was ever threatened
by invaders from the west. Another Danish encampment is thought to have stood
on the area of Leicester known as Dane Hills. The creation of the Danelaw made
as great an impression on Leicester as in the surrounding countryside. The
colonising Danes, soldiers and farmers, turned the Mercian cathedral city into
a garrison town. The term “gate,” descended from the Old Norse, “gata,” meaning
a street, occurs in a handful of streets in the heart of Leicester. All in the
same part of town we find Gallowtree Gate, Humberstone Gate, Church Gate,
Belgrave Gate and Sanvey Gate. They lie outside the line of the former Roman
and medieval wall, beyond the bounds of the Anglo-Saxon town. As we all know,
the first four streets converge at the Clock Tower where High Street passed
through the former East Gate out of the walled enclosure of the medieval town. Thus,
the presence of the “gata” element in modern street names of Leicester suggests
that the Danes, when they made Leicester one of their strongholds, established
a new town outside the wall of the Mercian city. By the early years of the 10th
century, Leicester may have been like a town of two halves, sharply divided
into Anglo-Saxon and Danish quarters.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was reading the Slate Star Codex <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart">review</a> of The Cult of Smart. Part of it discusses charter vs state schools and the allegations of fraud of various kinds undermining charter schools record of better achievement. Reading it, I realized that I took for granted that public schools engage in systematic fraud in a variety of ways. I donâ€™t think this is something everyone understands, hence this post.</p>
<p>I went to a state school in the UK. State schools are rated on a 1 âˆ’ 4 scale from unsatisfactory to outstanding. My school was rated good, meaning a 3. A few memories which stand out. During my first week I saw one of the boys in my class who was 11 at the time held up against the wall in a corridor while a 16 year old put a shiv to his throat and robbed him. He handed over his wallet and keys. A year or two later and I remember seeing a small boy who struggled with depression held up by the throat against a locker and slapped in the face by a troublemaker from the same class in front of everyone just before we went in to the classroom. I remember classes which were filled start to finish with people shouting and talking. Neither of the first two events were common but they also werenâ€™t uncommon. No one was surprised to witness them. Itâ€™s worth emphasizing again that my school was above average, in fact quite far above average, and in a middle class area. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I was mostly in top ability streamed classes, meaning my classroom experience was likely far better than average.</p>
<p>There were many ways in which the school and teachers gamed the system to boost their measured performance. One way was to do exams for students. I was on a bottom set language class for French. After two years I literally couldnâ€™t speak a single sentence in french and maybe knew 20 words in total. I still passed my exams. How? We did the tests in class. Often the teacher would go through them with us. Literally giving us the test and then going through each question on the whiteboard and telling us what to write. A different year and a different teacher, this time the teacher would sit next to us and write the answers down. Why sit next to us? It was the bottom set so people often wouldnâ€™t even bother to write down the answer if they were told it. This kind of thing was normal, so much so that I, and I think most people there, didnâ€™t realize anything unusual was happening.</p>
<p>Another way schools game metrics is to cheat inspections. A major component of how schools are judged in the UK is through independent inspections carried out by an independent quasi-governmental organization called Ofsted. Now, you may imagine that these inspections would be unannounced, so as to best get a real image of how a school works. Not the case. Theyâ€™re scheduled well in advance. Before every inspection, a few things would happen in my school:</p>
<ul><li><p>The worst troublemaker kids would be taken aside and put in a special room where inspectors wouldnâ€™t see them. Either that or they would just be told not to come into school at all on that day.</p></li><li><p>All of us were told in assembly that an inspection was coming and to be on our best behavior on that day. Often teachers would have conversations with less serious troublemakers and impress on them that they would behave on that day or face consequences afterwards.</p></li><li><p>Teachers would put a great deal more effort into their lesson plans than was normal. Classroom behavior management would also be far stricter.
Because of these and other measures my school during an inspection was utterly different than my school on a normal day. On some level this isnâ€™t surprising. If teachersâ€™ promotions and managementâ€™s jobs depend on good inspection results and inspections are easy to game, people will game them. Incentives drive behavior. But itâ€™s still sad.</p></li></ul>
<p>Another way the stats were gamed was by not recording bad behavior. When a school gives a detention or suspends/â€‹expels a student, thereâ€™s a record of it. This is especially true of suspensions, students being sent home or expulsions. The more of these you have, the worse you look as a school. The solution then is obvious, donâ€™t punish people or punish them in non-recorded ways. Again, in my school it was completely normal for students in lower sets to swear at the teacher, talk over them or disrupt the class for everyone else. It was normal for someone to be aggressive and abusive towards others and to face at most a 40 minute detention, but even getting a detention would be unusual.</p>
<p>I realize that one data point is not enough to draw solid general conclusions. My own perception is that this kind of fraud wasnâ€™t specific to my school. My cousin went to a state school fairly nearby. Heâ€™s 4 years younger than me. During one of my winters back from undergrad we discussed his school and his experiences mirrored mine. His exact words regarding inspections were â€œI learned 4 times more that day than any other day that year. It was amazingâ€�. I talked to a few British students at university, although specifically the not middle/â€‹upper class ones who would have gone to public schools. They had gone to schools similar to mine in different parts of the country and their stories were similar and often worse. Two particularly funny examples from my friendsâ€™ experiences stand out. A teacher in year 9 walked up to a student who was talking, picked them up and threw them out of an (open) first floor window. My friend sitting in class noticed two boys making fun of him and then proceeded to get up in the middle of class while the teacher was talking, walk to their table, flip the table upwards to hit them in the face before going to sit down again when the teacher told him to. (Remember, my friend was a studious, sporty Asian kid and not a troublemaker. This kind of thing is normal in that environment). Comedic stories aside, my experiences in school, while not universal, seem fairly common in the UK and from what Iâ€™ve read of the statistics, bad US schools are far, far worse.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure what my point here is. I think I have two:</p>
<ul><li><p>Charters may cook their books in various ways. In the UK, State schools do too. I would be surprised if it wasnâ€™t also the case in the US.</p></li><li><p>I think that I feel like a lot of commentators on places like SSC have fairly middle class experiences of fairly good schools and that bleeds into how their comparison between state vs charter schools. Itâ€™s just good to remember that itâ€™s not those nice middle class schools that charters typically replace.</p></li></ul>

After that, we unfold and “push down” the minimum of the remaining elements.</p><p>Once we get to the beginning of the array, there will already be 2 elements in their places - the first and the last one. Thus, we will make 2 times less iterations of the outer loop. Due to this, the speed of the cocktail sort will be slightly higher than that of the bubble sort.</p><p>We’ll start with the small refactoring and extract the exchange function from our algorithm. We’ll call it <code>swap</code> :</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>function</span> <span>swap</span>(<span>arr</span>, <span>i</span>, <span>j</span>) {

        <h4>20 Feb 2021</h4>
        <p><a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Tools/">Tools</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Rant/">Rant</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/DevOps/">DevOps</a></p><p>
        TL;DR: Proposal for a way to define multiple-machine systems in a immutable way, without requiring by-hand layouts.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading a lot about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops#nixops">NixOps</a> recently, and although I’m still leaning towards <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> overall as my system configurator of choice (technically <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, but that’s not so relevant for this), I’ve realised there’s a gap in the market for better immutable infrastructure. Note that this is a half-formed proposal, not a plan to do things, as I’ve already got way too many things on my plate, but I felt it was worth sharing the idea with others if anyone feels like picking this up, or doing something derived from it.</p>
<p>The goal is as follows: I want to be able to declare things like “I want X replicas of this service running, on different nodes” and “don’t put too many things on one node so the load gets well shared”, while not having to layout by hand <em>which</em> nodes the services go on, as they’re <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">cattle not pets</a>. We can do this with Kubernetes right now, but at the cost of a system that tends towards being hard to debug when things go wrong, and things can <a href="https://k8s.af/">go very wrong</a>. It also has the limit that you have to containerise everything and isn’t really suited to managing local node setups (i.e. everything you need installed before you run the Kubernetes agent, like say ntp).</p>
<p>Nix OTOH, is absolutely designed for the local node setup, and NixOps would let us then setup multiple machines. However, NixOps is designed towards a “here’s a set of Nix expressions defining a series of specific machines”, and isn’t designed for any of the “choose where stuff goes for me” bits. These machines aren’t full-blown pets as they’re still automatically configured, but they’re not really fully cattle either.</p>
<p>We need a 3rd option: something with the best bits of both. Maybe it can be done with a variant of NixOps that defines a “basic node” config (stuff you want everywhere, like a specific kernel, ntp, maybe some firewall stuff), and then a series of “service” configs, that probably contain <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243920">an actual service config</a> and maybe any other packages/config that service needs, along with some metadata (e.g. replication count, memory/CPU requirements). It does need some sort of thing that decides “where does that particular service go” especially if the node that was carrying it goes down. Maybe we have some little service running on each node with <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus</a> to decide what goes where, but all compiling down to Nix configurations for ease of debugging. It would also need to be able to cope with the upgrade case, plausibly by using the consensus system to replace a subset at a time of the services (or maybe some magic with unique names for services so we can run old version + new version at the same time)</p>
<p>Ideally, we also have something that lets us say spit out <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> config for the more infrastructure things (NixOps supports AWS, Hetzner and GCE; Terraform supports <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers">basically everything</a> and so it’s just easier that way), and then we can have a single config language that defines everything about our system’s setup other than the source code. And without needing to write <a href="https://octopus.com/blog/introduction-to-hcl-and-hcl-tooling">HCL</a>!</p>
<p>I would also note that I don’t regard Nix as the definitive option on system config languages. I think the immutable infrastructure approach is great, but the Nix language <a href="https://davedellacosta.com/posts/2019-03-29-why-nixos-is-hard-and-how-to-fix.html#what-is-so-hard">is kinda awful</a>. I’m somewhat more fond of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, but I’ve used Nix here as the example as it’s the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla">800-pound gorilla</a> in this space currently. I’m not sure what “better” looks like, other than liking the approach of using an existing language (as Guix does with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile Scheme</a>) rather than building half of one along the way like Nix does.</p>
<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>

        <h3>Running an executable JAR file</h3>
        <p>
          <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>doc online is an open-source product available at its <a href="https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texdoc-online">GitLab repository page</a>. It consists of one server component that does host the API and the front-end at the same time. If you simply want to have these features available to you, download the latest build artifacts from there (i.e. the JAR file with dependencies) and run it with your local Java installation. Please note that the software requires a local <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> distribution installed and internet connection for fetching the topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          When running the JAR file, a local webserver will start up and host the service at <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>which is configurable through the command-line switches. Calling this address will open up the web interface. Appending API paths will execute the API calls and return the JSON objects. To stop the server from running, simply <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>the Java process.
        </p>
        <h3>Booting up a container</h3>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the preferred way to host your own instance should be running our Docker container (a list of available tags may be found<a href="https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texdoc-online/container_registry">at GitLab</a>). The Docker container runs the web service as its entrypoint so running the server will start up the web server . Because the Docker container is built on top of our <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>Live images, it does not require a local <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> installation which might be beneficial for web servers. Internet connection is required,though. This all comes at the cost of being quite a big docker image of some gigabytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Docker container runs for multiple days, it features an automated update of <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>Live. Every day at 00:01 in the morning, a full update of the distribution is performed updating to the latest and greatest package versions <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> Live has to offer. Please note, that updates between distribution releases will not be performed that way; in order to upgrade from TL&amp;nbsp;2020 to TL&amp;nbsp;2021 you would need to pull the latest Docker image again but that means that the need for re-pulling the Docker image reduces to once per year.

<p>We are probably all familiar with "555" telephone numbers. The basic idea is
that the 555 exchange code (or NXX in a NANP NXX-XXXX number) is reserved for
use in fiction. Of course, this isn't actually true at all, but that hasn't
stopped basically every work of fiction putting their imaginary telephone
numbers in the 555 exchange.</p>
<p>In reality, the 555 exchange has a somewhat bumpy history, as is the case with
most "special purpose" telephone ranges. Seemingly from the genesis of NANP as
a formal numbering standard, the 555 exchange was reserved for special use by
telcos, and was not to be used for normal subscriber lines. The 555 exchange
accumulated various and sundry uses, but most prominently, starting in the
early '60s it was used for directory service at 555-1212 in nearly all NPAs
(area codes). This was nearly the only successful use of the 555 exchange,
leaving it mostly empty.</p>
<p>Because the 555 exchange was conveniently largely out of use, it became common
for the entertainment industry to use 555 numbers in fiction. Wikipedia makes
the claim that the telephone industry had specifically recommended 555 numbers
for this use in the '60s, and while this is rather thinly sourced, it's not
hard to believe as any odd person in a technical role at a telephone company
might have suggested 555 as an exchange with extremely few assigned numbers.</p>
<p>In any case, the use of 555 numbers for fiction was somewhat informal. This
changed in 1994, when the telephone industry regretted leaving an entire
exchange out of use and formed a working group which allowed 555 numbers to
be assigned to nationwide communications services. The idea was that 555
numbers would have the unusual property of working nationwide when dialed as
only seven digits, somewhat like an early version of SMS short codes.</p>
<p>Because the use of 555 numbers in fiction was longstanding, the working group
explicitly reserved numbers starting 555-01 for use in fiction. This, in 1994,
is when this practice became formalized---but only for those 100 numbers.</p>
<p>In practice the 555 service as imagined was unsuccessful, and in the 2010s the
use was eliminated more or less by handshake agreement. Much like the pre-1994
state, the only valid phone numbers in the 555 exchange are 555-1212 for
directory assistance, and 555-4334. This latter number is apparently still
assigned for a nationwide use but no one specifies <em>what</em> use.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging, and... came up empty. 555-4334 in a number of area
codes turns up nothing from the CNAM service I use. Similar attempts with
a couple of validation/carrier lookup vendors returned different types of
useless results. I haven't found any mention of the number in old newspapers,
with the interesting exception of some newspapers listing their classified
ads with exclusively 555 numbers, including 4334.</p>
<p>It was not an unusual practice at the time for newspapers to provide special
"voice mail box" numbers for classified ads, but to my knowledge the use of 555
was not typical.  The first newspapers to do so were almost all in Utah, which
hints that it may have originated as a choice by a local telco, potentially
Mountain Bell but maybe more likely an independent. I will do some more digging
into this over time. It's interesting in that it suggests a major use of 555
numbers which no document I've seen on the history of the exchange mentions.
This practice doesn't seem to have been eliminated until the 1994 reallocation.</p>
<p>I also learned that in 2009 you could get a rebate of $7,555 or $4,334 on a new
Dodge Nitro. Isn't OCR fun?</p>
<p>Finally, I located an older FCC report (dated 1997) that lists 555-4334 as
allocated to MCI mail, an early e-mail service. MCI mail access was initially
by modem, and so it's possible that 555-4334 was used as an access number,
although an 800 number was also provided for this purpose and 4334 is not
mentioned anywhere I can find as an access number. An interesting feature of
MCI Mail was its ability to forwarded email to postal addresses (by printing and
mailing it) or by fax or teletype, so I speculate that 555-4334 may have been
used as a return number for TTY messages, since the TTY integration was
apparently bidirectional. In any case, another document noted that 555-4334 was
permitted to remain in service until that service ended, which may have been an
allowance due to the fact that MCI was a telephone carrier (and thus had
greater sway over the working group) and that replacing the number may have
been technically difficult.</p>
<p>Today, it remains the case that only 555-01xx is properly allocated for
fictional use. However, the 555 exchange as a whole is as dead (or considering
the use by newspapers, much  more dead) than ever before, so it remains common
to use the entire 555 exchange in fiction.</p>
<p>Oddly, the 555 NPA (rather than exchange) is allocated for similar
applications, but as far as I can tell it is not in use.</p>
<p>The failure of the post-1994 use of 555 for a "short dialing service" reflects
a larger series of telco failures that has left some other special prefixes.
In the '90s, a great deal of attention was directed towards "non-geographic"
dialing. Because the telephone system connected the nation together, why not
have a method of telephone dialing which is independent of geography? Well, as
it turns out, there are several reasons, but this didn't stop anyone from
trying.</p>
<p>Although there were a hodgepodge of other attempts, the first major
non-geographic dialing scheme is contained in the special 700 NPA (area code).
This NPA was allocated as a direct result of the breakup of the Bell system for
use directly by interexchange (long-distance) carriers, since all existing
numbering ranges were allocated to the exchange (local) carriers. The primary
service offered in this range was "EasyReach 700" from AT&amp;T, which was
basically carrier-managed "follow-me."</p>
<p>Follow-me is a common feature of business telephone systems that allows a call
to a given number (extension or DID) to be directed to one or more real
extensions depending on the location of the intended recipient. For example, a
call to a professional might go to their desk or to an assistant depending on
whether they are in the office, while an auto mechanic might have a call to a
general contact number ring at the front desk or in the shop depending on where
they are.</p>
<p>EasyReach 700 moved this same concept from the PABX to the telephone network,
making it possible for follow-me to span the nation and making it accessible to
businesses without an (expensive) PABX. For example, a consumer with two
different homes could get a 700 number and set it to forward to whichever house
they were staying in, while a traveling salesman could set their 700 number
to forward to whichever hotel they were staying in.</p>
<p>EasyReach was a failure. There were several reasons, but the most significant
relates to the billing climate of the time. Today, unlimited long-distance is
so ubiquitous that the issue may not be obvious, or you might naively assume
that AT&amp;T had found a way to resolve the long distance cost issue. They did
not---in fact, they came up with something worse. The owner of a 700 number
could set it up to either bill forward (to the caller) or reverse (to the
callee). This meant that the caller of a 700 number had virtually no way to
determine whether the call would be free or charged at long-distance rate, and
this was a huge deterrent to use of these numbers.</p>
<p>Today, this and other uses of the 700 NPA have all died out, leaving 700
a nearly empty NPA. Like other empty NPAs, 700 is sometimes hijacked for
special uses by non-mainstream carriers and corporate phone systems. If my
hazy memory is correct, the 700 NPA was used by GE's interoffice leased-line
long distance network when I briefly worked for a GE business. Wikipedia
says that WalMart still uses it this way.</p>
<p>Since the 700 NPA was such a success, AT&amp;T naturally decided to do it again.
In 1993, NANP allocated the 500 NPA to Personal Communications Service (PCS),
not to be confused with Personal Communications Service (PCS). In fact, the
same term was allocated to two completely different purposes by two different
telecom organizations within a few years. The latter refers to a set of
services offered by a wireless network, e.g. Sprint PCS, while the former
refers to...  EasyReach 700 all over again, except for now it's called True
Connections.</p>
<p>True Connections failed for the exact same reasons as EasyReach 700, and was
officially eliminated in 2000, but by this point AT&amp;T had already largely
replaced it with a service using 800 numbers which were of course always
reverse billed...  which you and I might think is obviously what they should
have done in the first place, but back in the '90s toll-free and non-geographic
were viewed as being different animals. It seems to have taken AT&amp;T a long time
to catch on to the fact that the realities of long-distance billing required
that they be closely linked.</p>
<p>The concept of PCS (the non-geographic dialing one) did not die out with True
Connections, and additional NPAs were allocated to the same purpose,
generally in the format of 5 followed by the same digit twice, much like 800.
500 numbers continue to be non-geographic and the billing situation remains
odd, but that hasn't stopped the use of 500 for certain uses like modem banks
for ISPs and some calling cards. Very few 500 numbers remain in use today
despite the multiple allocated 500 codes, and due to the billing issues it's
common for outbound calls to 500 numbers to be blocked. Similar to 700, it's
not unusual for 500 to be used for internal purposes, although this is probably
less of a good idea since PCS services in the 500 NPA have not officially been
ended.</p>
<p>500 and related PCS area codes (500 has a surprising number of overlays
considering how obscure its usage is) also see use for other miscellaneous
telco applications. For example, the 588 area code, also assigned to PCS, was
(and may still be) …</p></article></div>

It’s designed to bring skilled professionals into Taiwan, and if you’ve made more than ~$67k USD/year<label for="sn-1"></label><span>All of the prices are denominated in the law in New Taiwan Dollars, and have been converted into USD at October 2020 rates for this post. The threshold for eligibility is that you make more than $160,000 NTD/month.</span> at any point in the past three years you’re trivially eligible.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>There are also trickier ways to apply, such as proving your expertise in one of the eligible fields: Science and Technology, Economy, Education, Culture and Arts, Sports, Finance, Law, or Architecture. However, the bar for proving expertise is quite high (probably similar to an O-1 visa in the United States, depending on the category).</span> There is no lottery, anyone who is eligible can get approved within a couple months. If you’ve met the income requirement, it’s currently one of the easiest ways to get to Taiwan, and the visa it provides you allows you to enter Taiwan regardless of the COVID-19 situation in your country of origin. This post will explain the process for getting a Gold Card, including several tips that aren’t written down in any official documentation.</p><p>The most important tip is this: if you’re applying via your income, you should apply in the “Economy” category, <em>even if you think a different category describes your work better</em>. The other categories (especially Science and Technology) look for proof of income <strong>and</strong> proof of expertise, despite the law stating that only one is necessary. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, unlike the Ministry of Science and Technology, does things by the books and will approve you solely for the income requirement even if you are not an economist.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>As of February 2021, this may be changing — the Ministry of Economic Affairs appears to be rejecting people who work in fields not related to economics. The Ministry of Science and Technology says that they are now accepting people who work at any company related to science/technology and meet the salary requirement, but it’s too early to tell how strict they are about this.</span> Applying via income in a category other than “Economy” may cause your application to be rejected, and will likely incur a delay in processing your Gold Card request.<label for="sn-4"></label><span>If you’ve already applied in a category other than Economy, you have two options: You can either cancel your current application and submit a new one, paying the application fee a second time, or you can wait the month or two until your application is seen by the relevant ministry, and if it is rejected, change categories then by calling <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">Mr.&nbsp;Huang</a> and explaining the situation (which will not incur the extra fee).</span></p><p>In order to apply, you’ll need a picture of your passport with at least 6 months remaining on it before expiration, a copy of your W-2 or other document that shows your income<label for="sn-5"></label><span>Note that your paystubs are not a valid form of proof. If you don’t have a W-2 or similar tax document showing your full income (for instance, if you were only employed for part of the year), you may be able to get by with a document from your work stating what your income is, but I haven’t heard from anyone who’s done this. The guidelines specify a “月薪” which is translated as “monthly salary” — but this does not necessarily match the legal definition of salary as used in the US, which implies an employment relationship and a W-2. Things that are “月薪”: definitely W-2, possibly 1099-MISC. Things that are not 月薪: income reported on 1099-K, such as taking payment through card networks or being an Uber driver.</span>, a passport-style photo of yourself (a selfie taken in front of a white wall is fine), and a credit card or other method of payment to pay the couple hundred USD application fee.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>The application fees vary from ~$108 - $323 USD ($3,100 - $9,260 NTD) depending on your nationality, the duration of your Gold Card, and whether you apply from inside Taiwan or not. You can find how much the fee is for you in <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">this FAQ</a>. I paid $282 USD as an American applying for a 3-year Gold Card from outside of Taiwan.</span> Once you’ve got all that together, go to the <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">application website</a>, click “I want to apply”, then “Self application”, and create an account. Then start a new Gold Card application and fill out the form. It’ll ask for your address in Taiwan, you can leave it blank if you don’t know where you’ll be staying (which you probably don’t, yet).<label for="sn-7"></label><span>Once you do have an address in Taiwan, you should go to the <abbr title="National Immigration Agency">NIA</abbr> within 30 days to get a new copy of your Gold Card with the address on it.</span> It’ll also ask if you want to apply in Taiwan or at a consulate/embassy overseas - you should probably pick whatever consulate you’re closest to, I went with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco. You will also need to pick how long you want the card to be valid for, from 1-3 years. There is very little downside to picking a longer duration — it costs a trivial amount more, and is no harder to get.<label for="sn-8"></label><span>A possible reason to pick 2 years is if you want to reapply for a 3-year gold card in 2 years, using your current year’s salary — if, for instance, you expect to not be making enough for the salary cutoff once you move to Taiwan. I have no idea if this actually works (the Gold Card program is fairly new, so there aren’t many stories of people reapplying), but it’s worth considering, especially seeing as it could get you enough time to be able to apply for an <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/152932/">APRC</a>.</span></p><p>Once you’ve submitted your application, you’ll need to wait a few weeks for it to be processed — it took mine 25 days, and I think anywhere from 3 weeks to a month is pretty normal. Either you’ll get a message asking you to provide additional documentation (unlikely, if you’re using a W-2 and submitted everything correctly), or you’ll get an email asking you to submit your passport to the application location that you’ve selected.</p><p>Once you get to the passport submission stage, it can be a bit unclear what to do — you can’t visit in person in most places due to COVID-19<label for="sn-9"></label><span>in the United States, at least.</span>, and the SF TECO at least does not answer phone calls or emails<label for="sn-10"></label><span>While the main SF TECO phone number goes unanswered, if you have Gold Card questions, you can call Angela at (415) 364-5632 and she should be able to help. The line is often busy, but if you leave a message she’ll get back to you.</span> (although other TECOs may be better, you should at least try calling your local TECO). What you need to do is pretty simple, however: just mail in the passport submission notice PDF that you can download on the application website (Download → Download Passport Submission Notice), your passport or a notarized copy of your passport, and a self-addressed USPS priority mail return envelope.</p><p>If like me, you don’t want to send in your physical passport, getting a notarized copy is pretty easy.<label for="sn-11"></label><span>In California, at least — laws vary by state, make sure to check your local laws.</span> Make a document with a copy of your passport<label for="sn-12"></label><span>I used a photo that I scaled so the passport was 1:1 with real life when printed, since I don’t have a scanner.</span> (just the first page and signature is fine, no need to include the stamp pages) and the statement “I, &lt;my name&gt;, affirm that the attached is a true and complete copy of the document which it purports to represent.” Then take that document to a notary and have them notarize your signature on it.</p><p>Once the TECO receives your envelope with the passport, you should get an email saying you’re approved, and only waiting on getting the physical Gold Card in the mail. If you need to fly to Taiwan before it arrives, you can print out a form that will allow you to board the plane on the application website, under “Download → Download Resident Authorization.” If you do this, you’ll need to pay a ~$18 USD ($500 NTD) fee to replace the card once you get to Taiwan. About 21 days after you get the email saying you’re approved<label for="sn-13"></label><span>I was told it would be at most 21 days, but it took 25 for me.</span> you should get a call from the TECO asking to schedule an appointment for you to pick up your Gold Card.<label for="sn-14"></label><span>They may say that this is an “interview,” but you’ve already been approved, so you shouldn’t worry too much about that. They asked me what I do for work, what connections I have in Taiwan, when I planned to go, and where I planned to stay.</span></p><p>Note that the start date (and thus the end date) of your Gold Card is determined by the day the passport is approved, so you may want to be a little strategic if you apply for a Gold Card significantly before you want to go to Taiwan — you can get all the way to the passport submission stage, then wait until a month or so before you plan to leave to actually submit your passport.

	<p><small>February 20, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363196953065099265">I had a hot take</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hot take: Every distribution packager who's saying "you shouldn't
bundle dependencies" is implicitly telling software authors "you
should do more work for us and limit the features (and reliability) of
your software".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This was sparked by reading <a href="https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/">The modern packagerâ€™s security
nightmare</a>,
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zb1c4k/modern_packager_s_security_nightmare">via</a>.
I'm not exactly on one side or the other, but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363263921960980485">I do think distributions
should be honest about what they're asking for</a> and I
don't think they're going to get it.)</p>

<p>This hot take is a bit too narrow. What really matters is software
authors and modern software systems restricting the versions of
dependencies (for both maximum and minimum versions). Explicit or
implicit bundling on top of that just makes the problem slightly worse
for distributions.</p>

<p>For software authors, restricting the versions of dependencies that
they work with reduces the amount of work that they have to do,
both to test against a range of versions and to either forever chase
after whatever changes those dependencies like to make or to forever
limit what features of dependencies they use to ones available in
old versions (and sometimes both at once). In theory, both testing
and chasing after changes would be dealt with by <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> (if everyone followed it), at least for a
single program. In practice, not only are people fallible but also
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SemverHasLimits">people have a different understanding of what semantic versioning
means</a> because semantic versioning is ultimately
a social thing, not a technical one. Our field's history has shown
(sometimes vividly) that if software authors allow versions of
dependencies to move on them, soon or later things break and the
software author has to fix it.</p>

<p>(There's also the practical issue that not all dependencies even
claim or agree to follow semantic versioning in the first place.)</p>

<p>For distributors, once software authors start restricting versions
the distributor has both an upgrade problem and a distribution
problem. On the upgrade side, dealing with an issue in a program may now
require persuading it to accept a new version of a dependency. On the
distribution side, it's now likely that you'll have multiple programs
that have different version requirements for the same dependency. At the
very least this multiplies the packages involved.</p>

<p>(Many distributions also have package system design problems that
restricts the range of versions of things that they can have installed
at the same time. Even under <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, this is a
problem for the distribution the moment that you have two programs
with conflicting version requirements that can't both be packaged and
installed at the same time.)</p>

<p>However, there's no free lunch here. What distributors want when
they ask for unbundled dependencies without version restrictions is
for software authors to do the work to accept any version of their
dependencies, or at least any version that falls within <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, and for dependencies to faithfully follow semver and
also make it possible to package and install different major versions
(at least) at the same time. <strong>Accepting a broad version range of your
dependencies is actual work</strong>, even apart from the limitations it may
impose on what your code and your software can do. Software authors and
the creators of software package ecosystems (like Go and Rust) are not
refusing to do this because they don't like distributions; they are
refusing to do this because they have found, over and over again, that
this doesn't really work and does cause problems for software authors
(and often users of programs) in the long run.</p>

<p>(The software community that's gone through this experience the
most visibly is Go, which started out with intrinsically unversioned
dependencies that were used universally across all your programs
by default and wound up switching to strongly versioned dependencies
after many people had many problems with that initial state. Go
experienced so many problems that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/FallibleSemverAndMVS">they adopted an unusually strict
and software author friendly versioning scheme</a>.)</p>

<p>It's popular for people to argue that software authors should be doing
this work anyway even if the distributions weren't asking for it,
so them actually doing it is no big deal. This is quite convenient
for the people making the argument, but it doesn't make the argument
valid. Software authors don't owe anyone any work what so ever; they
do whatever work serves their needs and is interesting to them. With
limited time and interest, it's both rational and proper for software
authors to optimize for their own development.</p>

<p>PS: Generally distributions also want some combination of all software
to update to the latest version of their dependencies and for
dependencies to explicitly support older versions. This is also extra
work for software authors, especially when the distribution also wants
it to happen for older versions of programs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>Time has washed up more than some lost films</strong> as regards the life of Fritz Lang. Recent research has cast a new light on Lang’s first marriage and while the private lives of screen personalities rarely interest me, in this case it has already affected how his films are being viewed by at least by one recent biographer. The events concerning his first wife occurred either in the post-production of “Das wandernde Bild” or “Vier um die Frau” or the pre-production of “Der müde Tod,” although even that is a guess.</p><p><strong>Lang’s first wife was named Lisa Rosenthal</strong> although no source is absolutely positive about that and she is described – in some accounts – as a “Russian from Vilnius.” Little else is known about her and it is not her life that is fascinating as much as it is her death. One reference that I found was in Robert A. Armour’s <em>Fritz Lang</em>, published by Twayne Publishers in 1977. Armour wrote, “[Fritz] Lang divorced his first wife and married [Thea] von Harbou.”</p><p><strong>Lang didn’t divorce Lisa Rosenthal.</strong> Rosenthal died of a gunshot wound to the chest and therein hangs a tale that Lang left behind when he fled from Germany in 1933. The story is told in Patrick McGilligan’s <em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast </em>and the recap goes something like this: Thea von Harbou was married to actor Rudolf Klien-Rogge and when her affair with Lang – that was no secret to the film community – heated up, she moved out of her home with Klien-Rogge and moved into the same apartment building as Fritz Lang. One day Lisa Rosenthal comes home unexpectedly and finds Lang and Harbou engaged in “violent petting,” as Lang described it later, on the sofa. Shortly thereafter, Rosenthal is found dead in the bathtub from a gunshot to the chest delivered by Lang’s WWI sidearm that he kept as a memento. Phone calls were made but it wasn’t the police that were called immediately and suspicions flew. Harbou and Lang swore that Rosenthal shot herself and there was little the police could do and Lang and Harbou were charged with denial of assistance although that charge was soon dropped.&nbsp;</p><div id="Layer4">
    <p><strong>Suspicion fell on Lang that he had shot Lisa Rosenthal</strong> and émigrés brought that story to Hollywood years later although only in hushed tones and never when Lang was within earshot. No one has ever suggested that Thea von Harbou was in any way involved although obviously, if Lang killed his wife, von Harbou was some sort of accomplice even if only after-the-fact. What’s interesting in all of this is that so little is known about von Harbou. </p>
    <p><strong>There is talk that after “Der müde Tod”</strong> was finished Lang was committed to an insane asylum for a brief stay. Lang would mention in interviews that he visited insane asylums as a part of his research. The truth is lost to time. At this point all that remains is stories and gossip. Patrick McGilligan wrote, “No record of an inquest – no record, even, of Lisa Rosenthal’s death – could be found in the course of research for [<em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</em>].” Studio executives – including Erich Pommer – showed up at the scene and much like Hollywood moguls they influenced and cajoled the police to protect their star. </p>
    <p><strong>Frederick Ott in <em>The Films of Fritz Lang</em></strong> describes the death of the unnamed Frau Lang as an “apparent” suicide. Lotte Eisner in <em>Fritz Lang </em>states that Lang’s wife “committed suicide” and wrote in her biography <em>Ich hatte einst ein schones Vaterland: Memoiren</em>, published in 1984 and never translated into English: “[Lisa Rosenthal] then went into the bedroom [sic] and shot herself.” </p>
    <p><strong>McGilligan states: “Perhaps suicide</strong> was such a familiar condition in his mind that it leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue unbidden when the police arrived at his apartment on that fateful day, asking him to explain the inexplicable.” McGilligan bases this assumption on the content of Lang’s work stating that: “From the first film to the last, guilt, complicity, false accusation, irredeemable crime, inadvertent killings, and suicide haunt Lang’s work.” All of that is true except for the “guilt” and McGilligan seems to skip over the murders in Lang’s films. What “leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue” implies that something else had occurred and there is only one other possibility. McGilligan then writes: “After the death of Lisa Rosenthal, the litany [of suicides in Lang’s films] is compelling.” McGilligan then lists the suicides in Lang’s films and describes them as “unmistakable thematic statements.” </p>
    <p><strong>According to one study of Weimar films,</strong> the three major themes in the top 25% of the films were guilt [about starting WWI], generational issues and suicide. Suicide was common in the films of Weimar as it would be later in films in France and Asia. It began to wane in the years of the Hays Code in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>To attempt to solve whether Lisa Rosenthal’s death</strong> was murder or suicide by the content of the films Fritz Lang made after the event – especially the Hollywood films where Lang rarely had influence over the script – doesn’t make for a compelling case. Especially since a list of murders in Lang’s films would run even longer than a list of suicides. </p>
    <p><strong>Then again, a pistol being</strong> within grasping range shows up in Lang’s films quite often. McGilligan has produced an excellent biography of Lang and presents research that helps to understand the times that Lang lived. Where the author isn’t as impressive is in his understanding of the films and filmmaking as an art (eg, his description of the ending of “Spione” is inaccurate). There is no Hollywood ending to this story, no convenient set of symbols pointing to a resolution. There is only a dead woman with a gunshot chest wound bleeding in a bathtub and a lot of unanswered questions. That’s the end of the story. </p>

The aeroplane operating flight LGT5504 to New York JFK experienced heavy damage on an engine shortly after take-off. Engine parts (turbine blades) fell in the nearby village of Meerssen resulting in 2 people slightly injured and damage to cars.</strong></p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the South Limburg Safety Region, an explosion has probably occurred in engine number one of the aircraft. Metal parts such as turbine blades have come down around the Limburg town of Meerssen.</p>
<p>Debris hit an elderly woman, who was slightly injured as a result. A child also burned his fingers on a piece of metal.</p>
<p>In Meerssen several houses and cars got damaged by falling debris.</p>
<p>The thirty-year-old plane immediately diverted on three engines to Liège airport, where it landed safely after making a number of laps over the Ardennes to burn fuel and lose weight.</p>

<p>According to aviation expert Joris Melkert, it is a special incident: “<em>I cannot remember a recent case in the Netherlands where parts of an engine fell down.</em>”</p>
<p>The cause of the incident is unknown. The engine may have sucked up something causing the turbine blades to break. This is what the debris looks like, says the airport spokesman.</p>
<p>The police are calling on people to leave the debris behind, in connection with recording the damage.</p>
<p>The Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid (Dutch Safety Board) has started an exploratory investigation.</p>
